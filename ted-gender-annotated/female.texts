Let's start with day and night.
Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness, light and then darkness.
And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light.
These are chemical clocks, and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell.
I'll give you an example -- if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach, and you fly it all the way across the continent, and you drop it into a sloped cage, it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores, and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away.
It'll do this for weeks, until it kind of gradually loses the plot.
And it's incredible to watch, but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on; it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it.
So, we have this ability as well.
And in humans, we call it the "body clock."
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground, for a couple of months.
People actually volunteer for this, and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole.
So, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be, they all show the same thing.
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks.
And so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks, rather than somehow sensing the day outside.
So fine, we have a body clock, and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.
It's a huge driver for culture and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.
We evolved as a species near the equator, and so we're very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness.
But of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe and in Arctic Canada, where I live, we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter.
So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture, traditionally has been highly seasonal.
In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on; you enjoy your family life inside.
And in summer, it's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours, very active.
So, what would our natural rhythm look like?
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense?
Well, it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all, they sleep twice every night.
They go to bed around 8:00 p.m.
until midnight and then again, they sleep from about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise.
And in-between, they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed.
And during this time, there's a surge of prolactin, the likes of which a modern day never sees.
The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime, that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives.
So, cut to the modern day.
We're living in a culture of jet lag, global travel, 24-hour business, shift work.
And you know, our modern ways of doing things have their advantages, but I believe we should understand the costs.
Thank you.

I want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is, what it could be, and what your relationship to it is.
And in doing that, I want to offer you a vision, an imagined future, if you will, of how, as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it, "Once in a lifetime the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope and history rhyme."
I want to start with these word pairs here.
We all know which side of these we'd like to be on.
When philanthropy was reinvented a century ago, when the foundation form was actually invented, they didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either.
In fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways, as slow to respond to new challenges, as small and risk-averse.
And in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times, what Rockefeller called "the business of benevolence."
But by the end of the 20th century, a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way.
The thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about -- and that's exactly what is happening -- is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions, for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected, in service of the long term.
This entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters.
And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here, by new tools, like the ones we've seen here, and by new pressures.
I've been following this change for quite a while now, and participating in it.
This report is our main public report.
What it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago.
What I want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you.
And as I do that, I'm not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about -- the Gates or the Soros or the Google.
Instead, what I want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us: the democratization of philanthropy.
This is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time.
What I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments, each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy.
The first is mass collaboration, represented here by Wikipedia.
Now, this may surprise you.
But remember, philanthropy is about giving of time and talent, not just money.
Clay Shirky, that great chronicler of everything networked, has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way.
He said, "We have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money.
Now we have Wikipedia.
Suddenly big things can be done for love."
Watch, this spring, for Paul Hawken's new book -- Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about.
The book is called "Blessed Unrest."
And when it comes out, a series of wiki sites under the label WISER, are going to launch at the same time.
WISER stands for World Index for Social and Environmental Responsibility.
WISER sets out to document, link and empower what Paul calls the largest movement, and fastest-growing movement in human history: humanity's collective immune response to today's threats.
Now, all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren't going to take off.
But the ones that do are going to be the biggest, the most open, the fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history.
Second category is online philanthropy marketplaces.
This is, of course, to philanthropy what eBay and Amazon are to commerce.
Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.
And this challenges yet another assumption, which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy.
Take a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose.
Omidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose.
It's one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need.
Take a look at Changing the Present, started by a TEDster, next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present.
GiveIndia is for a whole country.
And it goes on and on.
The third category is represented by Warren Buffet, which I call aggregated giving.
It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer.
It's that he challenged another assumption, that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation.
There are now, today, so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing, bringing together people around a common goal, to think bigger.
One of the best known is Acumen Fund, led by Jacqueline Novogratz, a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED.
But there are many others: New Profit in Cambridge, New School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley, Venture Philanthropy Partners in Washington, Global Fund for Women in San Francisco.
Take a look at these.
These funds are to philanthropy what venture capital, private equity, and eventually mutual funds are to investing, but with a twist -- because often a community forms around these funds, as it has at Acumen and other places.
Now, imagine for a second these first three types of experiments: mass collaboration, online marketplaces, aggregated giving.
And understand how they help us re-perceive what organized philanthropy is.
It's not about foundations necessarily; it's about the rest of us.
And imagine the mash-up, if you will, of these things, in the future, when these things come together in the experiments of the future -- imagine that somebody puts up, say, 100 million dollars for an inspiring goal -- there were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the US last year, not out of the question -- but only puts it up if it's matched by millions of small gifts from around the globe, thereby engaging lots of people, and building visibility and engaging people in the goal that's stated.
I'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories, which are innovation, competitions and social investing.
They're betting a visible competition, a prize, can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues, and thereby speed the solution.
This tackles yet another assumption, that the giver and the organization is at the center, as opposed to putting the problem at the center.
You can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution.
That leaves the final category, social investing, which is really, anyway, the biggest of them all, represented here by Xigi.net.
And this, of course, tackles the biggest assumption of all, that business is business, and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world.
Xigi is a new community site that's built by the community, linking and mapping this new social capital market.
It lists already 1,000 entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise.
So we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return, the good that can be driven could be astonishing.
Now, what's really interesting here is that we're not thinking our way into a new way of acting; we're acting our way into a new way of thinking.
Philanthropy is reorganizing itself before our very eyes.
And even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don't yet fulfill this aspiration, I think this is the new zeitgeist: open, big, fast, connected, and, let us also hope, long.
We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things.
If we don't develop the stamina to stick with things -- whatever it is you pick, stick with it -- all of this stuff is just going to be, you know, a fad.
But I'm really hopeful.
And I'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy that's reorganizing itself, it's also whole other portions of the social sector, and of business, that are busy challenging "business as usual."
And everywhere I go, including here at TED, I feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing.
What we're seeing is people really wrestling to describe what is this new thing that's happening.
Words like "philanthrocapitalism," and "natural capitalism," and "philanthroentrepreneur," and "venture philanthropy."
We don't have a language for it yet.
Whatever we call it, it's new, it's beginning, and I think it's gong to quite significant.
And that's where my imagined future comes in, which I am going to call the social singularity.
Many of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer Vernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity, where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create, really, a shockingly new reality.
It may be that the social singularity ahead is the one that we fear the most: a convergence of catastrophes, of environmental degradation, of weapons of mass destruction, of pandemics, of poverty.
That's because our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them.
And as we've heard here, it is no exaggeration to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before.
The question is, is there a positive social singularity?
Is there a frontier for us of how we live together?
Our future doesn't have to be imagined.
We can create a future where hope and history rhyme.
But we have a problem.
Our experience to date, both individually and collectively, hasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do, or who we're going to need to be.
We are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible.
That's why I have one last thing I want to show you.
This is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great-grandfather.
This is a newspaper publisher and a banker.
And they were great community leaders.
And, yes, they were great philanthropists.
I keep this photograph close by to me -- it's in my office -- because I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men, both of whom I never knew.
And so, in their honor, I want to offer you this blank slide.
And I want you to imagine that this a photograph of you.
And I want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating.
Whatever that means to you.
And I want you to imagine that it's 100 years from now, and your grandchild, or great-grandchild, or niece or nephew or god-child, is looking at this photograph of you.
What is the story you most want for them to tell?
Thank you very much.

Giving five practical examples of crowd-driven philanthropy, she calls for a new generation of citizen leaders.</description>
<keywords>activism,bottom-up,community,global issues,philanthropy,potential</keywords>

I believe that there are new, hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life: schools, hospitals, workplaces, factories, offices, etc.
And something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of "democratization of intimacy."
And what do I mean by that?
I mean that what people are doing is, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels, they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them.
How are they doing this? They're doing it in a very simple way, by calling their mom from work, by IMing from their office to their friends, by texting under the desk.
The pictures that you're seeing behind me are people that I visited in the last few months.
And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.
And somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father.
One young woman brought her grandfather.
For 20 years, I've been looking at how people use channels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc.
What we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally, people are communicating on a regular basis with five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere.
Now, lets take some data. Facebook.
Recently some sociologists from Facebook -- Facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most enlargening of all channels.
And an average user, said Cameron Marlow, from Facebook, has about 120 friends.
But he actually talks to, has two-way exchanges with, about four to six people on a regular base, depending on his gender.
Academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists, but fundamentally people chat with two, three, four -- anyway, less than five.
My own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people. 80 percent.
And when you go to Skype, it's down to two people.
A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed.
I mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes when I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people.
And some sociologists actually feel that it's a closure, it's a cocooning, that we're disengaging from the public.
And I would actually, I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it, and from where they're doing it, actually there is an incredible social transformation.
There are three stories that I think are quite good examples.
The first gentleman, he's a baker.
And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning.
And around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven, cleans his hands from the flour and calls his wife.
He just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day.
And I've heard this story a number of times.
A young factory worker who works night shifts, who manages to sneak away from the factory floor, where there is CCTV by the way, and find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight.
Or a mother who, at four o'clock, suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home.
Then there is another couple, there is a Brazilian couple.
They've lived in Italy for a number of years.
They Skype with their families a few times a week.
But once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table, pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it.
And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland.
They had set up a big screen in their living room, and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother.
But Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist who is working on Filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the Philippines, was telling me about how much parenting is going on through Skype, and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype.
And then there is the third couple. They are two friends.
They chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually.
And finally, finally, they've managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work.
And now, obviously, they have it open.
Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other.
And this is exactly what we've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table, and texting under the table to their friends.
So, none of these cases are unique.
I mean, I could tell you hundreds of them.
But what is really exceptional is the setting.
So, think of the three settings I've talked to you about: factory, migration, office.
But it could be in a school, it could be an administration, it could be a hospital.
Three settings that, if we just step back 15 years, if you just think back 15 years, when you clocked in, when you clocked in to an office, when you clocked in to a factory, there was no contact for the whole duration of the time, there was no contact with your private sphere.
If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere.
If you were in management, oh, that was a different story.
Maybe you had a direct line.
If you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator.
But basically, when you walked into those buildings, the private sphere was left behind you.
And this has become such a norm of our professional lives, such a norm and such an expectation.
And it had nothing to do with technical capability.
The phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand, fully to the people around you.
That was where the focus had to be.
And this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage.
If you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children, to make them used to staying long hours away from their family.
And then the school enacts perfectly well.
It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices: rituals of entry, rituals of exit, the schedules, the uniforms in this country, things that identify you, team-building activities, team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids, or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time.
And of course, the major thing: learn to pay attention, to concentrate and focus your attention.
This only started about 150 years ago.
It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy, and of industrial revolution.
When people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work.
And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach, where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere.
So, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades.
They were living on top of the land they were laboring.
They were living on top of the workshops where they were working.
And if you think, it's permeated our whole culture, even our cities.
If you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there.
Now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas.
And actually, over these 150 years, there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged.
So the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out, the more removed he would be from his personal sphere.
People have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations.
And they are doing it massively.
The Pew Institute, which produces good data on a regular basis on, for instance, in the States, says that -- and I think that this number is conservative -- 50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office.
I really think that the number is conservative.
In my own research, we saw that the peak for private email is actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country.
75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones.
100 percent are using text.
The point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions.
I'm always surprised the U.S. Army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance, of soldiers in Iraq having daily contact with their families.
But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access.
And every day, every single day, I read news that makes me cringe, like a $15 fine to kids in Texas, for using, every time they take out their mobile phone in school.
Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York, if seen with a mobile phone in a hand.
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook.
Behind issues of security and safety, which have always been the arguments for social control, in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention, to decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated.
And they are actually trying to block, in a certain sense, this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy.

<title>Stefana Broadbent: How the Internet enables intimacy</title>
<description>We worry that IM, texting, Facebook are spoiling human intimacy, but Stefana Broadbent's research shows how communication tech is capable of cultivating deeper relationships, bringing love across barriers like distance and workplace rules.</description>
<keywords>anthropology,humanity,love,psychology,social media,society,technology</keywords>

So today, I'm going to tell you about some people who didn't move out of their neighborhoods.
The first one is happening right here in Chicago.
Brenda Palms-Farber was hired to help ex-convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison.
Currently, taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail.
We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.
I find it interesting that, for every one dollar we spend, however, on early childhood education, like Head Start, we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future.
Or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to Harvard as well.
But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that, took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution: create a business that produces skin care products from honey.
Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.
It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential.
She hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees, harvest the honey and make value-added products that they marketed themselves, and that were later sold at Whole Foods.
She combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed, like anger-management and teamwork, and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more.
Less than four percent of the folks that went through her program actually go back to jail.
So these young men and women learned job-readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process.
Talk about a sweet beginning.
Now, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles, and lots of people know that L.A. has its issues.
But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.
They have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains.
Currently, 20 percent of California's energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly Southern California.
Their spending loads, loads, to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well.
Now Andy Lipkis is working to help L.A. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island -- linking trees, people and technology to create a more livable city.
All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water, also helps cool our cities.
Because, come to think about it, do you really want air-conditioning, or is it a cooler room that you want?
How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.
So a few years ago, L.A. County decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools.
And Andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves.
And by presenting a really strong economic case, they convinced the L.A. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery, that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure.
So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided, and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down, while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up, resulting in a net-savings to the system, but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.
Now Judy Bonds is a coal miner's daughter.
Her family has eight generations in a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.
And if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history, and of the town, it should be Judy.
But the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.
Now, two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months, and only for about a few years' worth of coal.
That kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal."
It can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months.
Just imagine that the air surrounding these places -- it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.
When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just miners, but everybody.
And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned.
And the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied, leaving even more unemployment in their wake.
But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain, and one that was reduced in elevation by over 2,000 feet.
Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs, or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills, and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region's wind.
She calculated the up-front cost and the payback over time, and it's a net-plus on so many levels for the local, national and global economy.
It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal, but the wind energy actually pays back forever.
Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals, and it gives them a lot of misery.
The water is turned into goo.
Most people are still unemployed, leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience -- drug and alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.
Now Judy and I -- I have to say -- totally related to each other.
Not quite an obvious alliance.
I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia.
I mean, they are not -- they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that.
But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me, says, "Save the endangered hillbillies."
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about.
But just a few months ago, Judy was diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer.
Yeah.
And it has since moved to her bones and her brain.
And I just find it so bizarre that she's suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from.
But her dream of Coal River Mountain Wind is her legacy.
And she might not get to see that mountaintop.
But rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something, she's leaving behind a business plan to make it happen.
That's what my homegirl is doing.
So I'm so proud of that.
But these three people don't know each other, but they do have an awful lot in common.
They're all problem solvers, and they're just some of the many examples that I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from in the examples of the work that I do now.
I was really lucky to have them all featured on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show called ThePromisedLand.org.
Now they're all very practical visionaries.
They take a look at the demands that are out there -- beauty products, healthy schools, electricity -- and how the money's flowing to meet those demands.
And when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs, you're left with unemployed people, and those people aren't cheap.
In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens, and they include generationally impoverished, traumatized vets returning from the Middle East, people coming out of jail.
And for the veterans in particular, the V.A. said there's a six-fold increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.
I think that number's probably going to go up.
They're not the largest number of people, but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress.
So these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands, reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future.
And there are plenty of other examples like that.
One problem: waste handling and unemployment.
Even when we think or talk about recycling, lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates -- they leave much to be recycled.
And where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities.
And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models -- there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park, where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another, or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell.
We can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing.
And in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx, but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot.
Fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years, the city wanted to build a jail.
They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.
Another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.
Working-class and poor urban Americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system.
It relies too much on transportation, chemical fertilization, big use of water and also refrigeration.
Mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land, and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity.
And so we know "urban ag" is a big buzz topic this time of the year, but it's mostly gardening, which has some value in community building -- lots of it -- but it's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production.
The numbers just aren't there.
Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce in every city, that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities, owned and operated by small growers, where now there are only consumers.
This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce.
It's not a competition with rural farm; it's actually reinforcements.
It allies in a really positive and economically viable food system.
The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands for hospitals, senior centers, schools, daycare centers, and produce a network of regional jobs, as well.
This is smart infrastructure.
And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day.
Our municipalities, rural and urban, play the operational course of infrastructure -- things like waste disposal, energy demand, as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs.
Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs.
And we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base.
And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability.
So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.
These examples indicate a trend.
I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.
I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country, and the good news is that it's growing.
And we all need to be invested in it.
It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.
And I call it "hometown security."
The recession has us reeling and fearful, and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering.
It's a realization that we are the key to our own recovery.
Now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local.
And when we do that, our neighbors -- be they next-door, or in the next state, or in the next country -- will be just fine.
The sum of the local is the global.
Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses, putting people to work, restoring our natural systems.
Hometown security means creating wealth here at home, instead of destroying it overseas.
Tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings, wealth generation and national security.
Many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across America.
The challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more.
Now, hometown security is about taking care of your own, but it's not like the old saying, "charity begins at home."
I recently read a book called "Love Leadership" by John Hope Bryant.
And it's about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.
And reading that book made me reexamine that theory because I need to explain what I mean by that.
See, my dad was a great, great man in many ways.
He grew up in the segregated South, escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times, and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.
But, like all of us, he had some problems.
And his was gambling, compulsively.
To him that phrase, "Charity begins at home," meant that my payday -- or someone else's -- would just happen to coincide with his lucky day.
So you need to help him out.
And sometimes I would loan him money from my after-school or summer jobs, and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest, of course, after he hit it big.
And he did sometimes, believe it or not, at a racetrack in Los Angeles -- one reason to love L.A. -- back in the 1940s.
He made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that I grew up in.
So I'm not that unhappy about that.
But listen, I did feel obligated to him, and I grew up -- then I grew up.
And I'm a grown woman now, and I have learned a few things along the way.
To me, charity often is just about giving, because you're supposed to, or because it's what you've always done, or it's about giving until it hurts.
I'm about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year -- I'm not trying to feed the habit.
I spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment, that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it, actually left people in the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.
And over the past 20 years, we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems, yet educational outcomes, malnutrition, incarceration, obesity, diabetes, income disparity, they've all gone up with some exceptions -- in particular, infant mortality among people in poverty -- but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.
And I know a little bit about these issues, because, for many years, I spent a long time in the non-profit industrial complex, and I'm a recovering executive director, two years clean.
But during that time, I realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities.
But I really did struggle for financial support.
The greater our success, the less money came in from foundations.
And I tell you, being on the TED stage and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that I had arrived.
And by the time I'd moved on, I was actually covering a third of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.
And I think because early on, frankly, my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.
But since then, the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk became this little thing.
But I did in fact get married in it.
Over here.
There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.
The South Bronx Greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.
Since then, we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here.
And we love this, because I love construction now, because we're watching these things actually happen.
So I want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise.
I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people.
Hometown security is next on my to-do list.
What we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises, who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual.
We need to work together to embrace and repair our land, repair our power systems and repair ourselves.
It's time to stop building the shopping malls, the prisons, the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures.
It is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility.
Thank you very much.

<title>Majora Carter: 3 stories of local eco-entrepreneurship</title>
<description>The future of green is local -- and entrepreneurial. In her talk, Majora Carter brings us the stories of three people who are saving their own communities while saving the planet. Call it "hometown security." &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>
<keywords>business,cities,community,economics,green</keywords>

I, like many of you, am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities.
And there are days -- I don't know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when I palpably feel how much I rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life.
And some days, that can even be a little scary.
But what I'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues, if we apply open source collaboration.
A couple of years ago, I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment.
Now at the time that I was reading this, it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment.
So I was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next Wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future.
But that was actually exactly the point that Michael Pollan was making in this article -- was it's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system.
So, I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space.
And you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants' root systems.
Now to a vegetable plant, my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space.
But I can offer some natural light and year-round climate control.
Fast-forward two years later: we now have window farms, which are vertical, hydroponic platforms for food-growing indoors.
And the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom, which periodically sends some of this liquid nutrient solution up to the top, which then trickles down through plants' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there's no dirt involved.
Now light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate, so a window farm requires a farmer, and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm, and whether she is going to feed her food organically.
Back at the time, a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing.
And I really wanted it to be an open project, because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the United States right now and could possibly become another area like Monsanto, where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people's food.
So I decided that, instead of creating a product, what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co-developers.
The first few systems that we created, they kind of worked.
We were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical New York City apartment window.
And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.
But the first few systems were these leaky, loud power-guzzlers that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved.
So to bring on more co-developers, what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs, we explained how they worked, and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems.
And then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us.
So actually now on this website, we have 18,000 people.
And we have window farms all over the world.
What we're doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R&amp;D, or research and development.
But what we call it is R&amp;D-I-Y, or research and develop it yourself.
So for example, Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps.
It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right, but once we did, we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half.
Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments, like lots of other window farmers, and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low-light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients.
And window farmers in Finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the Finnish winters by outfitting them with LED grow lights that they're now making open source and part of the project.
So window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software.
And with every open source project, the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns.
So my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone.
And we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers.
So for do-it-yourselfers, we provide free, very well-tested instructions so that anyone, anywhere around the world, can build one of these systems for free.
And there's a patent pending on these systems as well that's held by the community.
And to fund the project, we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don't have time to build their own systems.
Now within our community, a certain culture has appeared.
In our culture, it is better to be a tester who supports someone else's idea than it is to be just the idea guy.
What we get out of this project is we get support for our own work, as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs.
But I think that Eileen expresses best what we really get out of this, which is the actual joy of collaboration.
So she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea, built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing.
If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people, maybe we just need to ditch the term "consumer" and get behind the people who are doing stuff.
Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own.
And what we're seeing is that R&amp;D-I-Y has moved beyond just window farms and LEDs into solar panels and aquaponic systems.
And we're building upon innovations of generations who went before us.
And we're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now.
So we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united, and to declare that we are all still pioneers.

Imagine, if you will -- a gift.
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.
It's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball.
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.
But before I show you what's inside, I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.
It will bring all of your family together.
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven't heard from in years.
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you.
It will recalibrate what's most important in your life.
It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith.
You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body.
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.
You'll expand your vocabulary, meet new people, and you'll have a healthier lifestyle.
And get this -- you'll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing.
You'll eat countless gourmet meals.
Flowers will arrive by the truckload.
People will say to you, "You look great. Have you had any work done?"
And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs.
You'll be challenged, inspired, motivated and humbled.
Your life will have new meaning.
Peace, health, serenity, happiness, nirvana.
The price?
$55,000, and that's an incredible deal.
By now I know you're dying to know what it is and where you can get one.
Does Amazon carry it?
Does it have the Apple logo on it?
Is there a waiting list?
Not likely.
This gift came to me about five months ago.
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty.
And this, and then this.
It was a rare gem -- a brain tumor, hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving.
And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you.
I'm not sure you'd want it.
But I wouldn't change my experience.
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you.
So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected, unwanted and uncertain, consider that it just may be a gift.

I have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres.
Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1.
I've also lived in Biosphere 2.
And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres.
And hopefully from that I get to learn something.
So what did I learn? Well, here I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza.
So I am harvesting the wheat, in order to make the dough.
And then of course I have to milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese.
It took me four months in Biosphere 2 to make a pizza.
Here in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes, because I pick up the phone and I call and say, "Hey, can you deliver the pizza?"
So Biosphere 2 was essentially a three-acre, entirely sealed, miniature world that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes.
Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass, underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel -- essentially entirely sealed.
So we had our own miniature rainforest, a private beach with a coral reef.
We had a savanna, a marsh, a desert.
We had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything.
And of course we had our human habitat, where we lived.
Back in the mid-'80s when we were designing Biosphere 2, we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions.
I mean, what is a biosphere?
Back then, yes, I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right?
Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one.
And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed -- that is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material -- and energetically open, which is essentially what planet Earth is.
This is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2 that we called our Test Module.
And the very first day that this fellow, John Allen, walked in, to spend a couple of days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there to hopefully keep him alive, the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin, or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something, fungus.
But of course none of that happened.
And over the ensuing few years, there were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2.
But by 1991 we finally had this thing built.
And it was time for us to go in and give it a go.
We needed to know, is life this malleable?
Can you take this biosphere, that has evolved on a planetary scale, and jam it into a little bottle, and will it survive?
Big questions.
And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe -- if we were going to go to Mars, for instance, would we take a biosphere with us, to live in it?
We also wanted to know so we can understand more about the Earth that we all live in.
Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby.
Let's take it on a maiden voyage.
Will it work? Or will something happen that we can't understand and we can't fix, thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres?
So eight of us went in: four men and four women.
More on that later.
And this is the world that we lived in.
So, on the top, we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean, and underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it, which is where all the pumps and the valves and the water tanks and the air handlers, and all of that.
One of the Biospherians called it "garden of Eden on top of an aircraft carrier."
And then also we had the human habitat of course, with the laboratories, and all of that.
This is the agriculture.
It was essentially an organic farm.
The day I walked into Biosphere 2, I was, for the first time, breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world, except seven other people.
At that moment I became part of that biosphere.
And I don't mean that in an abstract sense; I mean it rather literally.
When I breathed out, my CO2 fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing.
And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes.
And those sweet potatoes became part of me.
In fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato.
I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again.
I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way.
When it came to our atmosphere, however, it wasn't that much of a joke over the long term, because it turned out that we were losing oxygen, quite a lot of oxygen.
And we knew that we were losing CO2.
And so we were working to sequester carbon.
Good lord -- we know that term now.
We were growing plants like crazy.
We were taking their biomass, storing them in the basement, growing plants, going around, around, around, trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere.
We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere.
We stopped irrigating our soil, as much as we could.
We stopped tilling, so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air.
But our oxygen was going down faster than our CO2 was going up, which was quite unexpected, because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module.
And it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek.
We had lost seven tons of oxygen.
And we had no clue where it was.
And I tell you, when you lose a lot of oxygen -- and our oxygen went down quite far; it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent -- my goodness, do you feel dreadful.
I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere.
And we had sleep apnea at night.
So you'd wake up gasping with breath, because your blood chemistry has changed.
And that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you -- -- take a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating.
And everybody outside thought we were dying.
I mean, the media was making it sound like were were dying.
And I had to call up my mother every other day saying, "No, Mum, it's fine, fine.
We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine."
And the doctor was, in fact, checking us to make sure we were, in fact, fine.
But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen.
And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures.
And it was time for us to put oxygen in.
And you might think, well, "Boy, your life support system was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?"
Yes. In a sense it was terrifying.
Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door at any time, if it really got bad, though who was going to say, "I can't take it anymore!"?
Not me, that was for sure.
But on the other hand, it was the scientific gold of the project, because we could really crank this baby up, as a scientific tool, and see if we could, in fact, find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone.
And we did indeed find it.
And we found it in the concrete.
Essentially it had done something very simple.
We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost.
It broke down; it took oxygen out of the air; it put CO2 into the air; and it went into the concrete.
Pretty straightforward really.
So at the end of the two years when we came out, we were elated, because, in fact, although you might say we had discovered something that was quite "uhh," when your oxygen is going down, stopped working, essentially, in your life support system, that's a very bad failure.
Except that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it.
And nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that.
And we proved the concept, more or less.
People, on the other hand, was a different subject.
We were -- yeah I don't know that we were fixable.
We all went quite nuts, I will say.
And the day I came out of Biosphere 2, I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends.
For two years I'd been seeing people through the glass.
And everybody ran up to me.
And I recoiled. They stank!
People stink!
We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant, and all kinds of stuff.
Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean, but nothing with perfume.
And boy do we stink out here.
Not only that, but I lost touch of where my food came from.
I had been growing all my own food.
I had no idea what was in my food, where it came from.
I didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating.
In fact, I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops, reading all the names on all of the things.
People must have thought I was nuts.
It was really quite astonishing.
And I slowly lost track of where I was in this big biosphere, in this big biosphere that we all live in.
In Biosphere 2 I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday, and it had an impact on me, very viscerally, very literally.
So I went about my business: Paragon Space Development Corporation, a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere, because I had nothing else to do.
And one of the things we did was try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres, and what can you do with them?
And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station.
We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station, for 16 months, where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space -- really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are.
And I'm also proud to announce that you're getting a sneak preview -- on Friday we're going to announce that we're actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon, which is going to be pretty fun.
And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing: an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars.
And part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of CO2 and oxygen and water through this plant system.
As a result of that modeling I ended up in all places, in Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa.
Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia, is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful, incredibly stark, and I have no understanding of how people eke out a living there.
It is so dry.
This is what I saw.
But this is also what I saw.
I saw a company that had taken seawater and sand, and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it.
And it will produce a food crop.
In this case it was oilseed.
It was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves in a plantation.
And the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals, so that they could produce milk and whatnot, like we had in the Biosphere.
And all of it was coming from this: shrimp farms.
Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth, frankly, from an environmental point of view.
They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean.
They also pollute their next-door neighbors.
And what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these, and turning them into all of this food.
They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people.
They had created an industrial ecosystem, of a sense.
I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program, under the U.N.
Kyoto Protocol system.
And as I was modeling this mangrove swamp, I was thinking to myself, "How do you put a box around this?"
When I'm modeling a plant in a box, literally, I know where to draw the boundary.
In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea.
Well, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth.
And understand its interactions with the entire Earth.
And put your project in that context.
Around the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation, from what I would call a biocidal species, one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally -- have designed our systems to kill life, a lot of the time.
This is in fact, this beautiful photograph, is in fact over the Amazon.
And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation.
And those beautiful wispy clouds are, in fact, fires, human-made fires.
We're in the process of transforming from this, to what I would call a biophilic society, one where we learn to nurture society.
Now it may not seem like it, but we are.
It is happening all across the world, in every kind of walk of life, and every kind of career and industry that you can think of.
And I think often times people get lost in that.
They go, "But how can I possibly find my way in that?
It's such a huge subject."
And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does.
This is the story of a rake in my backyard.
This was my backyard, very early on, when I bought my property.
And in Arizona, of course, everybody puts gravel down.
And they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away.
And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out, and I want to throttle them.
It's a certain type of aesthetic.
We're very uncomfortable with untidiness.
And I threw away my rake.
And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property.
And over time, essentially what have I been doing?
I've been building topsoil.
And so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks.
And I have an oasis.
This is what happens every spring. For six weeks, six to eight weeks, I have this flush of green oasis.
This is actually in a riparian area.
And all of Tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake.
The small stuff counts.
The Industrial Revolution -- and Prometheus -- has given us this, the ability to light up the world.
It has also given us this, the ability to look at the world from the outside.
Now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to, and compare it to this biosphere.
But we can look at the world, and try to understand where we are in its context, and how we choose to interact with it.
And if you lose where you are in your biosphere, or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere, I would say to you, take a deep breath.
The yogis had it right.
Breath does, in fact, connect us all in a very literal way.
Take a breath now.
And as you breathe, think about what is in your breath.
There perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting next-door to you.
Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here.
It also connects us in time.
There may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs.
There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now that will be in the breath of your great-great-great-grandchildren.
Thank you.

I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that, by far, most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light.
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes.
The Sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected off the Moon.
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history.
And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang.
And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent.
I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum.
It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.
Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition.
And while we've never heard the sounds from space, we really should, in the next few years, start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.
So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like.
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky.
We can't see them directly.
They're not brought to us with light, at least not directly.
We can see them indirectly, because black holes wreak havoc on their environment.
They destroy stars around them.
They churn up debris in their surroundings.
But they won't come to us directly through light.
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet.
And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.
But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space.
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Now even light will be bent by those paths.
And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.
These are the natural curves in space.
What Einstein did not realize was that, if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe.
It wasn't Einstein who realized this, it was Karl Schwarzschild who was a German Jew in World War I -- joined the German army already an accomplished scientist, working on the Russian front.
I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire, and then, in between, calculating Einstein's equations -- as you do in the trenches.
And he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity, and he was thrilled by this theory.
And he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary: curves so strong that space would rain down into them, space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole.
And even light could not escape this current.
Light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be, and all that would be left would be a shadow.
Now he wrote to Einstein, and he said, "As you will see, the war has been kind to me enough.
Despite the heavy gunfire, I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas."
And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution, and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist.
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions.
And he took Schwarzschild's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week.
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.
He did not believe they existed in nature.
He thought nature would protect us from their formation.
It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.
It's actually not massive enough.
But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit, maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun.
And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light -- so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan.
So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.
There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in.
But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.
And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience.
And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they're not seen.
Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.
So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second.
At the end of their lives, they're going around each other very near the speed of light.
So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only curve space, but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time.
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.
This was one of the groups.
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves.
And if you can see -- it's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves.
They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day.
If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space.
You would literally hear the sound.
Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully, so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.
But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict.
This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.
And we can predict what the sound will be.
We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.
Then it's gone.
Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.
It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves.
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving.
Want to get away from the sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer together.
In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.
And then they're going to merge.
Now it's gone.
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end.
Now that's our prediction for what we'll see.
Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.
And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.
And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us.
But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers.
It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up.
There's also a mission proposed for space, which hopefully will launch in the next ten years, called LISA.
And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun.
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in some embrace.
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core.
But they're not frozen; they're actually merging.
These two black holes are colliding, and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.
It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration.
But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together.
And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When that expression was coined, it was derisive -- like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"
But now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang.
It might make a sound.
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.
We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
It's everywhere, it's all around you, and the space is wobbling chaotically.
Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us.
Galaxies form, and generations of stars form in those galaxies, and around one star, at least one star, is a habitable planet.
And here we are frantically building these experiments, doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.
Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
That song has been ringing through space for all that time.
We weren't even here.
It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.
It's like hurry, build your instruments.
It's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...
whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity -- we'll build them, we'll turn on the machines and, bang, we'll catch it -- the first song from space.
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up, it would sound like this.
It's a terrible sound.
It's literally the definition of noise.
It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.
But it's around us everywhere, presumably, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe.
And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation, of our observable universe.
So within the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit, render the universe in audio.
But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.
If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?
Will it happen again?
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever.
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history?
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures?
Here's my multiverse creatures.
Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins?
And if they are, I can imagine them as we are, calculating, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

Trees epitomize stasis.
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations, but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs, trees become very dynamic entities, moving and growing.
And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists.
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas, and that produced art.
The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir, and what I learned was that different species have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet.
But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it, so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year, I simply measured and summed each of those lines.
I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year.
And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year.
You might have a guess.
The answer is actually 186,540 miles, or seven times around the globe.
And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs, we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities, but rather extremely dynamic.
And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees, to consider other entities that are also static and stuck, but which cry for change and dynamicism, and one of those entities is our prisons.
Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws are stuck, confined behind bars.
And our prison system itself is stuck.
The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women.
That number is rising.
Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released, 60 will return to prison.
Funds for education, for training and for rehabilitation are declining, so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues.
I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons, and I think the answer is yes.
In the year 2007, I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections.
Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists, sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons.
We give science lectures, and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting.
That, I think, is movement.
We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state.
That, I think, is movement.
We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog -- for later release into protected wetlands.
That, I think, is movement.
And just recently, we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities.
They've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners.
They're kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day.
When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals, they're placed in immobile booths like this.
For one hour a day they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards.
Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments, we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards, putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact with visual images of nature.
This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months, and he's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene, more calm, less apt to violence.
And so what we see, I think, is that small, collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope.
We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks.
But if trees can create art, if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year, if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs, then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves, like grief, like addictions, like racism, that can also change.
Thank you very much.

The story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist, as an Iranian woman artist, as an Iranian woman artist living in exile.
Well, it has its pluses and minuses.
On the dark side, politics doesn't seem to escape people like me.
Every Iranian artist, in one form or another, is political.
Politics have defined our lives.
If you're living in Iran, you're facing censorship, harassment, arrest, torture -- at times, execution.
If you're living outside like me, you're faced with life in exile -- the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family.
Therefore, we don't find the moral, emotional, psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility.
Oddly enough, an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice, the speaker of my people, even if I have, indeed, no access to my own country.
Also, people like myself, we're fighting two battles on different grounds.
We're being critical of the West, the perception of the West about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us, about our women, about our politics, about our religion.
We are there to take pride and insist on respect.
And at the same time, we're fighting another battle.
That is our regime, our government -- our atrocious government, [that] has done every crime in order to stay in power.
Our artists are at risk.
We are in a position of danger.
We pose a threat to the order of the government.
But ironically, this situation has empowered all of us, because we are considered, as artists, central to the cultural, political, social discourse in Iran.
We are there to inspire, to provoke, to mobilize, to bring hope to our people.
We are the reporters of our people, and are communicators to the outside world.
Art is our weapon.
Culture is a form of resistance.
I envy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression.
For the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics.
From the fact that they are only serving one audience, mainly the Western culture.
But also, I worry about the West, because often in this country, in this Western world that we have, culture risks being a form of entertainment.
Our people depend on our artists, and culture is beyond communication.
My journey as an artist started from a very, very personal place.
I did not start to make social commentary about my country.
The first one that you see in front of you is actually when I first returned to Iran after being separated for a good 12 years.
It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
While I was absent from Iran, the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran and had entirely transformed the country from Persian to the Islamic culture.
I came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that I found my place in the society.
But instead, I found a country that was totally ideological and that I didn't recognize anymore.
More so, I became very interested, as I was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions, I became immersed in the study of the Islamic Revolution -- how, indeed, it had incredibly transformed the lives of Iranian women.
I found the subject of Iranian women immensely interesting, in the way the women of Iran, historically, seemed to embody the political transformation.
So in a way, by studying a woman, you can read the structure and the ideology of the country.
So I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life, and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse -- the subject of martyrdom, the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God, faith, but violence and crime and cruelty.
For me, this became incredibly important.
And yet, I had an unusual position toward this.
I was an outsider who had come back to Iran to find my place, but I was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.
This changed slowly as I found my voice and I discovered things that I didn't know I would discover.
So my art became slightly more critical.
My knife became a little sharper.
And I fell into a life in exile.
I am a nomadic artist.
I work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico.
I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran.
Now I am making films.
Last year, I finished a film called "Women Without Men."
"Women Without Men" returns to history, but another part of our Iranian history.
It goes to 1953 when American CIA exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader, Dr. Mossadegh.
The book is written by an Iranian woman, Shahrnush Parsipur.
It's a magical realist novel.
This book is banned, and she spent five years in prison.
My obsession with this book, and the reason I made this into a film, is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female -- traditionally, historically in Iran -- and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change, freedom and democracy -- while the country of Iran, equally, as if another character, also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions.
I made this film because I felt it's important for it to speak to the Westerners about our history as a country.
That all of you seem to remember Iran after the Islamic Revolution.
That Iran was once a secular society, and we had democracy, and this democracy was stolen from us by the American government, by the British government.
This film also speaks to the Iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized -- in the way we looked, in the way we played music, in the way we had intellectual life.
And most of all, in the way that we fought for democracy.
These are some of the shots actually from my film.
These are some of the images of the coup.
And we made this film in Casablanca, recreating all the shots.
This film tried to find a balance between telling a political story, but also a feminine story.
Being a visual artist, indeed, I am foremost interested to make art -- to make art that transcends politics, religion, the question of feminism, and become an important, timeless, universal work of art.
The challenge I have is how to do that.
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story.
How to move you with your emotions, but also make your mind work.
These are some of the images and the characters of the film.
Now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009, as my film is released -- the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran.
What is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film, the cry for democracy and social justice, repeats itself now again in Tehran.
The green movement significantly inspired the world.
It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy.
What was most significant for me was, once again, the presence of the women.
They're absolutely inspirational for me.
If in the Islamic Revolution, the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn't have a voice, now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of Tehran -- women who were educated, forward thinking, non-traditional, sexually open, fearless and seriously feminist.
These women and those young men united Iranians across the world, inside and outside.
I then discovered why I take so much inspiration from Iranian women.
That, under all circumstances, they have pushed the boundary.
They have confronted the authority.
They have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way.
And once again, they proved themselves.
I stand here to say that Iranian women have found a new voice, and their voice is giving me my voice.
And it's a great honor to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist, even if I have to operate in the West only for now.
Thank you so much.

So I want to take you on a trip to an alien world.
And it's not a trip that requires light-years of travel, but it's to a place where it's defined by light.
So it's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light.
I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence.
I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs.
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution.
But mostly I'm entranced by it.
Since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible, when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays, I've been a bioluminescence junky.
But I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words, and they were totally inadequate to the task.
I needed some way to share the experience directly.
And the first time I figured out that way was in this little single-person submersible called Deep Rover.
This next video clip, you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence.
And the first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across.
In front of the sub, a mess screen will come into contact with the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea.
With the sub's lights switched off, it is possible to see their bioluminescence -- the light produced when they collide with the mesh.
This is the first time it has ever been recorded.
Edith Widder: So I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye.
Which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible.
But just to try to prove that fact to you, I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration.
So, if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible, I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it.
And you'll note there's no light coming from them right now, either because they're dead -- or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like.
Oops. Sorry.
I spend most of my time working in the dark; I'm used to that.
Okay.
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate, a single-celled alga.
So why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light?
Well, it uses it to defend itself from its predators.
The flash is like a scream for help.
It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm, and just like the alarm on your car or your house, it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder, thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away.
There's a lot of animals that use this trick, for example this black dragonfish.
It's got a light organ under its eye.
It's got a chin barbel.
It's got a lot of other light organs you can't see, but you'll see in here in a minute.
So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime, because the top speed of this fish is one knot, which was the top speed of the submersible.
But it was worth it, because we caught it in a special capture device, brought it up into the lab on the ship, and then everything on this fish lights up.
It's unbelievable.
The light organs under the eyes are flashing.
That chin barbel is flashing.
It's got light organs on its belly that are flashing, fin lights.
It's a scream for help; it's meant to attract attention.
It's phenomenal.
And you normally don't get to see this because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets.
There's other ways you can defend yourself with light.
For example, this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud.
This blinds or distracts the predator.
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this.
Now it may look like a tasty morsel, or a pig's head with wings -- but if it's attacked, it puts out a barrage of light -- in fact, a barrage of photon torpedoes.
I just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing.
It's phenomenal.
So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean -- most of them that make light.
And we have a pretty good idea, for most of them, why.
They use it for finding food, for attracting mates, for defending against predators.
But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean, that's where things get really strange.
And some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in "Avatar," but you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them.
They're things like this.
This is a golden coral, a bush.
It grows very slowly.
In fact, it's thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old, which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed.
The other reason is this amazing bush glows.
So if you brush up against it, any place you brushed against it, you get this twinkling blue-green light that's just breathtaking.
And you see things like this.
This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book -- just all manner of creatures all over this thing.
And these are flytrap anemones.
Now if you poke it, it pulls in its tentacles.
But if you keep poking it, it starts to produce light.
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy.
It produces these strings of light, presumably as some form of defense.
There are starfish that can make light.
And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms.
This looks like a plant, but it's actually an animal.
And it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock.
So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents, as you see here.
But if we collect it very gently, and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock, it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume, changing color as it goes, from green to blue.
Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure.
But we have no idea why it does that.
Here's another one. This is also a sea pen.
It's got a brittle star hitching a ride.
It's a green saber of light.
And like the one you just saw, it can produce these as bands of light.
So if I squeeze the base, the bands go from base to tip.
If I squeeze the tip, they go from tip to base.
So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle?
I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about.
So there's a language of light in the deep ocean, and we're just beginning to understand it, and one way we're going about that is we're imitating a lot of these displays.
This is an optical lure that I've used.
We call it the electronic jellyfish.
It's just 16 blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays.
And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals, so it's unobtrusive.
So I just want to show you some of the responses we've elicited from animals in the deep sea.
So the camera's black and white.
It's not high-resolution.
And what you're seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of -- like the cockroaches of the ocean -- there are isopods all over it.
And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish.
And when it starts flashing, it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast.
But as soon as it starts to flash -- and it's going to look big, because it blooms on the camera -- I want you to look right here.
There's something small there that responds.
We're talking to something.
It looks like a little of string pearls basically -- in fact, three strings of pearls.
And this was very consistent.
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet.
We basically have a chat room going on here, because once it gets started, everybody's talking.
And I think this is actually a shrimp that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water.
But the cool thing is, we're talking to it.
We don't know what we're saying.
Personally, I think it's something sexy.
And then finally, I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep-sea webcam, which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year.
We've only just begun to analyze all of this data.
This is going to be a glowing source first, which is like bioluminescent bacteria.
And it is an optical cue that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean.
So this scavenger comes in, which is a giant sixgill shark.
And I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there.
But if it had been following the odor plume, it would have come in from the other direction.
And it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish.
That's a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark.
Okay, so this next one is from the webcam, and it's going to be this pinwheel display.
And this is a burglar alarm.
And that was a Humboldt squid, a juvenile Humboldt squid, about three feet long.
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon.
But if it's a burglar alarm, you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly.
It's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish.
But we did see a bunch of responses like this.
This guy is a little more contemplative.
"Hey, wait a minute.
There's supposed to be something else there."
He's thinking about it.
But he's persistent.
He keeps coming back.
And then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more, and thinks, "Maybe if I come in from a different angle."
Nope.
So we are starting to get a handle on this, but only just the beginnings.
We need more eyes on the process.
So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible, by all means, climb in and take the plunge.
This is something that should be on everybody's bucket list, because we live on an ocean planet.
More than 90 percent, 99 percent, of the living space on our planet is ocean.
It's a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures, alien life forms that you don't have to travel to another planet to see.
But if you do take the plunge, please remember to turn out the lights.
But I warn you, it's addictive.
Thank you.

So I want to tell you a story -- an encouraging story -- about addressing desperation, depression and despair in Afghanistan, and what we have learned from it, and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help them to regain some confidence in the time ahead -- in the future -- and how to participate again in everyday life.
So, I am a Jungian psychoanalyst, and I went to Afghanistan in January 2004, by chance, on an assignment for Medica Mondiale.
Jung in Afghanistan -- you get the picture.
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, and 70 percent of the people are illiterate.
War and malnutrition kills people together with hope.
You may know this from the media, but what you may not know is that the average age of the Afghan people is 17 years old, which means they grow up in such an environment and -- I repeat myself -- in 30 years of war.
So this translates into ongoing violence, foreign interests, bribery, drugs, ethnic conflicts, bad health, shame, fear and cumulative traumatic experiences.
Local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non-governmental organizations.
And people had hope, yes, but until they realized their situation worsens every day -- either because they are being killed or because, somehow, they are poorer than eight years ago.
One figure for that: 54 percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition.
Yet, there is hope.
One day a man told me, "My future does not look brilliant, but I want to have a brilliant future for my son."
This is a picture I took in 2005, walking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul, and for me it's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation.
So, doctors prescribe medication.
And donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads.
Military collect weapons, and depression stays intact.
Why?
Because people don't have tools to cope with it, to get over it.
So, soon after my arrival, I had confirmed something which I had already known; that my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe, yes.
However, what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds -- they are universal.
And the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context.
After a counseling session, a woman said to me, "Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again, and I want to participate again in my family life."
This was very important, because the family is central in Afghans' social system.
No one can survive alone.
And if people feel used, worthless and ashamed, because something horrible has happened to them, then they retreat, and they fall into social isolation, and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones, because they do not want to burden them.
And very often violence is a way to cope with it.
Traumatized people also easily lose control -- symptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks -- so people are in a constant fear that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly, suddenly, and they cannot control it.
To compensate this loss of inner control, they try to control the outside, very understandably -- mostly the family -- and unfortunately, this fits very well into the traditional side, regressive side, repressive side, restrictive side of the cultural context.
So, husbands start beating wives, mothers and fathers beat their children, and afterward, they feel awful.
They did not want to do this, it just happened -- they lost control.
The desperate try to restore order and normality, and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence, it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt.
And partly this is already happening.
So everybody needs a sense for the future, and the Afghan sense of the future is shattered.
But let me repeat the words of the woman.
"Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again."
So the key here is empathy.
Somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you.
Somebody has to feel how you felt.
And somebody has to see you and listen to you.
Everybody must be able to know what he or she has experienced is true, and this only goes with another person.
So everybody must be able to say, "This happened to me, and it did this with me, but I'm able to live with it, to cope with it, and to learn from it.
And I want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children, and I will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter," -- what happens too often in Afghanistan.
So something can be done, even in such extreme environments as Afghanistan.
And I started thinking about a counseling program.
But, of course, I needed help and funds.
And one evening, I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul, and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan.
And I explained to him quickly, I would train psycho-social counselors, I would open centers, and I explained to him why.
This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said, "If you want to do this, call me."
At that time, it was the head of Caritas Germany.
So, I was able to launch a three-year project with Caritas Germany, and we trained 30 Afghan women and men, and we opened 15 counseling centers in Kabul.
This was our sign -- it's hand-painted, and we had 45 all over Kabul.
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that.
And 70 percent regained their lives.
This was a very exciting time, developing this with my wonderful Afghan team.
And they are working with me up to today.
We developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach.
So, from 2008 up until today, a substantial change and step forward has been taking place.
The European Union delegation in Kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the Ministry of Public Health, to lobby this approach -- we succeeded.
We revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho-social care and psycho-social counselors to the system.
This means, certainly, to retrain all health staff.
But for that, we already have the training manuals, which are approved by the Ministry and moreover, this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan.
So we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces, and you are the first to see the results.
We wanted to know if what is being done is effective.
And here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression, moderate and severe.
And the red line is the treatment as usual -- medication with a medical doctor.
And all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse.
And the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only, without medication.
And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away, and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly, which is explicable, because you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses, but you can learn how to cope with them.
So this makes us very happy, because now we also have some evidence that this is working.
So here you see, this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan, and every morning it looks like this all over.
And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients, but now this will change.
They go to the clinics, because they want to cure their immediate symptoms, and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions, develop their resources, learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future.
And I would like to share one short vignette.
One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor, "If we were to have met some years ago, then we would have killed each other.
And now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future."
And another counselor said to me after the training, "You know, I never knew why I survived the killings in my village, but now I know, because I am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan."
So I believe this kept me running.
And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation.
And also -- I think -- without psycho-social therapy, and without considering this in all humanitarian projects, we cannot build-up civil societies.
I thought it was an idea worth spreading, and I think it must be, can be, could be replicated elsewhere.
I thank you for your attention.

<title>Inge Missmahl: Bringing peace to the minds of Afghanistan</title>
<description>When Jungian analyst Inge Missmahl visited Afghanistan, she saw the inner wounds of war -- widespread despair, trauma and depression. And yet, in this county of 30 million people, there were only two dozen psychiatrists. Missmahl talks about her work helping to build the country's system of psychosocial counseling, promoting both individual and, perhaps, national healing.</description>

How does the news shape the way we see the world?
Here's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass.
And here's how news shapes what Americans see.
This map -- -- this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories, by country, in February of 2007 -- just one year ago.
Now, this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities.
There was massive flooding in Indonesia.
And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming.
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage.
And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent, we see a lot of Iraq -- that's that big green thing there -- and little else.
The combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent.
When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story, here's how the world looked.
What was that story? The death of Anna Nicole Smith.
This story eclipsed every country except Iraq, and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report.
And the cycle continues; as we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately.
So, why don't we hear more about the world?
One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half.
Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai, there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America -- places that are home to more than two billion people.
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper.
And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news.
Local TV news looms large, and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news.
And what about the web?
The most popular news sites don't do much better.
Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on Google News' front page.
And they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events.
Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters, and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it.
So, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates, as well as less educated Americans, know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago.
And if you think it's simply because we are not interested, you would be wrong.
In recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over 50 percent.
The real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world?
I know we can do better.
And can we afford not to? Thank you.

I'm a storyteller.
And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call "the danger of the single story."
I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria.
My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth.
So I was an early reader, and what I read were British and American children's books.
I was also an early writer, and when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading: All my characters were white and blue-eyed, they played in the snow, they ate apples, how lovely it was that the sun had come out.
Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria.
I had never been outside Nigeria.
We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes, and we never talked about the weather, because there was no need to.
My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer.
Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was.
And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer.
But that is another story.
What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children.
Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify.
Things changed when I discovered African books.
There weren't many of them available, and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books.
But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature.
I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature.
I started to write about things I recognized.
Now, I loved those American and British books I read.
They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me.
But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature.
So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are.
I come from a conventional, middle-class Nigerian family.
My father was a professor.
My mother was an administrator.
And so we had, as was the norm, live-in domestic help, who would often come from nearby rural villages.
So the year I turned eight we got a new house boy.
His name was Fide.
The only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor.
My mother sent yams and rice, and our old clothes, to his family.
And when I didn't finish my dinner my mother would say, "Finish your food! Don't you know? People like Fide's family have nothing."
So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.
Then one Saturday we went to his village to visit, and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made.
I was startled.
It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something.
All I had heard about them was how poor they were, so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor.
Their poverty was my single story of them.
Years later, I thought about this when I left Nigeria to go to university in the United States.
I was 19.
My American roommate was shocked by me.
She asked where I had learned to speak English so well, and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language.
She asked if she could listen to what she called my "tribal music," and was consequently very disappointed when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.
She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove.
What struck me was this: She had felt sorry for me even before she saw me.
Her default position toward me, as an African, was a kind of patronizing, well-meaning pity.
My roommate had a single story of Africa: a single story of catastrophe.
In this single story there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way, no possibility of feelings more complex than pity, no possibility of a connection as human equals.
I must say that before I went to the U.S. I didn't consciously identify as African.
But in the U.S. whenever Africa came up people turned to me.
Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia.
But I did come to embrace this new identity, and in many ways I think of myself now as African.
Although I still get quite irritable when Africa is referred to as a country, the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from Lagos two days ago, in which there was an announcement on the Virgin flight about the charity work in "India, Africa and other countries."
So after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African, I began to understand my roommate's response to me.
If I had not grown up in Nigeria, and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images, I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals, and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and AIDS, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner.
I would see Africans in the same way that I, as a child, had seen Fide's family.
This single story of Africa ultimately comes, I think, from Western literature.
Now, here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Locke, who sailed to west Africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage.
After referring to the black Africans as "beasts who have no houses," he writes, "They are also people without heads, having their mouth and eyes in their breasts."
Now, I've laughed every time I've read this.
And one must admire the imagination of John Locke.
But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling African stories in the West: A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives, of difference, of darkness, of people who, in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling, are "half devil, half child."
And so I began to realize that my American roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story, as had a professor, who once told me that my novel was not "authentically African."
Now, I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel, that it had failed in a number of places, but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity.
In fact I did not know what African authenticity was.
The professor told me that my characters were too much like him, an educated and middle-class man.
My characters drove cars.
They were not starving.
Therefore they were not authentically African.
But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story.
A few years ago, I visited Mexico from the U.S.
The political climate in the U.S. at the time was tense, and there were debates going on about immigration.
And, as often happens in America, immigration became synonymous with Mexicans.
There were endless stories of Mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system, sneaking across the border, being arrested at the border, that sort of thing.
I remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara, watching the people going to work, rolling up tortillas in the marketplace, smoking, laughing.
I remember first feeling slight surprise.
And then I was overwhelmed with shame.
I realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind, the abject immigrant.
I had bought into the single story of Mexicans and I could not have been more ashamed of myself.
So that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become.
It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power.
There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is "nkali."
It's a noun that loosely translates to "to be greater than another."
Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power.
Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person, but to make it the definitive story of that person.
The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people, the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with, "secondly."
Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans, and not with the arrival of the British, and you have an entirely different story.
Start the story with the failure of the African state, and not with the colonial creation of the African state, and you have an entirely different story.
I recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel.
I told him that I had just read a novel called American Psycho -- -- and that it was such a shame that young Americans were serial murderers.
Now, obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation.
But it would never have occurred to me to think that just because I had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all Americans.
This is not because I am a better person than that student, but because of America's cultural and economic power, I had many stories of America.
I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.
I did not have a single story of America.
When I learned, some years ago, that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful, I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me.
But the truth is that I had a very happy childhood, full of laughter and love, in a very close-knit family.
But I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps.
My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare.
One of my closest friends, Okoloma, died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water.
I grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education, so that sometimes my parents were not paid their salaries.
And so, as a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table, then margarine disappeared, then bread became too expensive, then milk became rationed.
And most of all, a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives.
All of these stories make me who I am.
But to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me.
The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete.
They make one story become the only story.
Of course, Africa is a continent full of catastrophes: There are immense ones, such as the horrific rapes in Congo and depressing ones, such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in Nigeria.
But there are other stories that are not about catastrophe, and it is very important, it is just as important, to talk about them.
I've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person.
The consequence of the single story is this: It robs people of dignity.
It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult.
It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar.
So what if before my Mexican trip I had followed the immigration debate from both sides, the U.S. and the Mexican?
What if my mother had told us that Fide's family was poor and hardworking?
What if we had an African television network that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world?
What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls "a balance of stories."
What if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher, Mukta Bakaray, a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house?
Now, the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature.
He disagreed. He felt that people who could read, would read, if you made literature affordable and available to them.
Shortly after he published my first novel I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview, and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said, "I really liked your novel. I didn't like the ending.
Now you must write a sequel, and this is what will happen ..."
And she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel.
I was not only charmed, I was very moved.
Here was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians, who were not supposed to be readers.
She had not only read the book, but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel.
Now, what if my roommate knew about my friend Fumi Onda, a fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos, and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget?
What if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the Lagos hospital last week?
What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music, talented people singing in English and Pidgin, and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo, mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.
What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports?
What if my roommate knew about Nollywood, full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds, films so popular that they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce?
What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider, who has just started her own business selling hair extensions?
Or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail, but continue to nurse ambition?
Every time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians: our failed infrastructure, our failed government, but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government, rather than because of it.
I teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer, and it is amazing to me how many people apply, how many people are eager to write, to tell stories.
My Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit called Farafina Trust, and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don't have anything in their libraries, and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops, in reading and writing, for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories.
Stories matter.
Many stories matter.
Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize.
Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity.
The American writer Alice Walker wrote this about her Southern relatives who had moved to the North.
She introduced them to a book about the Southern life that they had left behind: "They sat around, reading the book themselves, listening to me read the book, and a kind of paradise was regained."
I would like to end with this thought: That when we reject the single story, when we realize that there is never a single story about any place, we regain a kind of paradise.
Thank you.

It's Monday morning.
In Washington, the president of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office, assessing whether or not to strike Al Qaeda in Yemen.
At Number 10 Downing Street, David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double-dip recession.
In Madrid, Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door, listening to her baby crying and crying, trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it.
And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital, trying to work out whether I should let him drink the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said, "You must make him drink today," -- my father's been nil by mouth for a week -- or whether, by giving him this bottle, I might actually kill him.
We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives, and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions.
We talk things over with our friends, we scour the Internet, we search through books.
But still, even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends, it's still experts that we rely upon most -- especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters.
Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity, we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can -- that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own.
And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing, we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do.
But I believe that this is a big problem, a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society, as a culture and as individuals.
It's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world -- of course they have.
The problem lies with us: we've become addicted to experts.
We've become addicted to their certainty, their assuredness, their definitiveness, and in the process, we have ceded our responsibility, substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom.
We've surrendered our power, trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide.
This is no exaggeration.
In a recent experiment, a group of adults had their brains scanned in an MRI machine as they were listening to experts speak.
The results were quite extraordinary.
As they listened to the experts' voices, the independent decision-making parts of their brains switched off.
It literally flat-lined.
And they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice, however right or wrong.
But experts do get things wrong.
Did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of 10?
Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself, you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you?
And then there's, of course, the example that we're all too aware of: financial experts getting it so wrong that we're living through the worst recession since the 1930s.
For the sake of our health, our wealth and our collective security, it's imperative that we keep the independent decision-making parts of our brains switched on.
And I'm saying this as an economist who, over the past few years, has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why, but also -- and I'm aware of the irony here -- as an expert myself, as a professor, as somebody who advises prime ministers, heads of big companies, international organizations, but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change, that we need to become more open-minded, more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view.
So in order to help you understand where I'm coming from, let me bring you into my world, the world of experts.
Now there are, of course, exceptions, wonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions.
But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps, that within these camps, a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition, that experts move with the prevailing winds, often hero-worshipping their own gurus.
Alan Greenspan's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on, not challenged by his peers, until after the crisis, of course.
You see, we also learn that experts are located, are governed, by the social and cultural norms of their times -- whether it be the doctors in Victorian England, say, who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire, or the psychiatrists in the United States who, up until 1973, were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness.
And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift, that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks -- because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects, or studies funded by food companies of their new products, massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market.
The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study.
And we've also got to be aware that experts, of course, also make mistakes.
They make mistakes every single day -- mistakes born out of carelessness.
A recent study in the Archives of Surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries, operating on the wrong side of the brain, carrying out procedures on the wrong hand, elbow, eye, foot, and also mistakes born out of thinking errors.
A common thinking error of radiologists, for example -- when they look at CT scans -- is that they're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient's problem to be.
So if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia, say, what happens is that, if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan, they literally stop looking at it -- thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient's lungs.
I've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts.
These are, of course, not the only insights I could share, but I hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them, why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision-making capabilities on.
But how can we do this?
Well for the sake of time, I want to focus on just three strategies.
First, we've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles.
This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D.
in every single subject, you'll be relieved to hear.
But it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when, for example, we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand.
Why was it that, when I had an operation, my doctor said to me, "Beware, Ms. Hertz, of hyperpyrexia," when he could have just as easily said, "Watch out for a high fever."
You see, being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs, their equations, their forecasts, their prophecies, and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like: What are the assumptions that underpin this?
What is the evidence upon which this is based?
What has your investigation focused on?
And what has it ignored?
It recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first, primarily on male animals and then, primarily on men.
It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world's population are women.
And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men -- and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take.
Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed.
Second, we need to create the space for what I call "managed dissent."
If we are to shift paradigms, if we are to make breakthroughs, if we are to destroy myths, we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out, in which we're bringing in new, diverse, discordant, heretical views into the discussion, fearlessly, in the knowledge that progress comes about, not only from the creation of ideas, but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that, by surrounding ourselves by divergent, discordant, heretical views.
All the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter.
Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts, which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true.
And that's why I talk about the need to actively manage dissent.
Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy.
In meetings, he looks out for the person in the room -- arms crossed, looking a bit bemused -- and draws them into the discussion, trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion, so that they have dissent within the room.
Managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement, discord and difference.
But we need to go even further.
We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are.
The conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees, fancy titles, diplomas, best-selling books -- high-status individuals.
But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO's, but also shop-girls -- yeah.
Best Buy, the consumer electronics company, gets all its employees -- the cleaners, the shop assistants, the people in the back office, not just its forecasting team -- to place bets, yes bets, on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas, on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company, on whether a project will come in on time.
By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company, Best Buy was able to discover, for example, that the store that it was going to open in China -- its big, grand store -- was not going to open on time.
Because when it asked its staff, all its staff, to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not, a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening.
It turned out that they were aware, as no one else within the company was, of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts, nor the experts on the ground in China, were even aware of.
The strategies that I have discussed this evening -- embracing dissent, taking experts on, democratizing expertise, rebellious strategies -- are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing, complex, difficult times.
For if we keep our independent decision-making part of our brains switched on, if we challenge experts, if we're skeptical, if we devolve authority, if we are rebellious, but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance, uncertainty and doubt, and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too, we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the 21st century.
For now, more than ever, is not the time to be blindly following, blindly accepting, blindly trusting.
Now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open -- yes, using experts to help us figure things out, for sure -- I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here -- but being aware of their limitations and, of course, also our own.
Thank you.

<title>Noreena Hertz: How to use experts -- and when not to</title>
<description>We make important decisions every day -- and we often rely on experts to help us decide. But, says economist Noreena Hertz, relying too much on experts can be limiting and even dangerous. She calls for us to start democratizing expertise -- to listen not only to "surgeons and CEOs, but also to shop staff."</description>

I'd like to talk about my dad.
My dad has Alzheimer's disease.
He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago, and he was officially diagnosed in 2005.
Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating, he needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is or when it is, and it's been really, really hard.
My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life, and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear.
My dad's not alone. There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia, and by 2030 they're expecting that to double to 70 million.
That's a lot of people.
Dementia scares us. The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia, the big numbers of people who get it, they frighten us.
And because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things: We go into denial: "It's not me, it has nothing to do with me, it's never going to happen to me."
Or, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia, and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us.
I'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.
Prevention is good, and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's.
I'm eating right, I'm exercising every day, I'm keeping my mind active, that's what the research says you should do.
But the research also shows that there's nothing that will 100 percent protect you.
If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.
That's what happened with my dad.
My dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds.
He got dementia anyway.
If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.
Especially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families.
So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.
Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father, and researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparation: I'm changing what I do for fun, I'm working to build my physical strength, and -- this is the hard one -- I'm trying to become a better person.
Let's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself.
You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends, because you don't know who they are.
It's confusing to watch television, and often very frightening.
And reading is just about impossible.
When you care for someone with dementia, and you get training, they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar, hands-on, open-ended.
With my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms.
He was a college professor at a state school; he knows what paperwork looks like.
He'll sign his name on every line, he'll check all the boxes, he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers.
But it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me?
I'm my father's daughter. I read, I write, I think about global health a lot.
Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins?
Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color?
So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on.
I've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it.
I am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box.
And I'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blob.
But, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it.
Because the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do, the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore.
They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier, easier for their caregivers to look after, and it may even slow the progress of the disease.
That all seems like win to me.
I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can.
A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms, as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance, you get muscle tremors, and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile.
They get scared to walk around. They get scared to move.
So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance.
I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it, I'll still be able to be mobile.
I'm doing weight-bearing exercise, so that I have the muscle strength so that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move around.
Finally, the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person.
My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's, and he's kind and loving now.
I've seen him lose his intellect, his sense of humor, his language skills, but I've also seen this: He loves me, he loves my sons, he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers.
And that love makes us want to be around him, even now.
even when it's so hard.
When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world, his naked heart still shines.
I was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as loving.
And what I need now is to learn to be like that.
I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia, it will survive.
I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease.
What I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me.
But if it comes for me, I'm going to be ready.
Thank you.

<title>Alanna Shaikh: How I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's</title>
<description>When faced with a parent suffering from Alzheimer's, most of us respond with denial or extreme efforts at prevention. But global health expert and Fellow Alanna Shaikh sees it differently. She's taking three concrete steps to prepare for the moment -- should it arrive -- when she herself gets Alzheimer's disease.</description>

Thank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up here said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared, but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.
And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.
There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.
What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa.
Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS, the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict, and the Africa of disasters.
While it is true that those things are going on, there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.
And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.
This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.
This is the Africa of opportunity.
This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies.
And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this. That's what I want to talk about today.
And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa.
On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria, was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.
He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family.
This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria -- led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.
Due to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria where, according to our constitution, those in office as governors, president -- as in many countries -- have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened: people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.
Today, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail.
This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good, and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite.
And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa -- corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.
Does it mean the problem is over? The answer is no.
There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.
And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.
So when you hear about corruption, don't just feel that nothing is being done about this -- that you can't operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case.
There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing and is being won. In others, like mine, where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria, the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.
But the truth of the matter is that this is going on.
The results are showing: independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption, and governance is improving.
A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.
And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance.
That is that people talk about corruption, corruption.
All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa.
That's the image: African countries. But let me say this: if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London -- if the other people who had taken money, estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this, what is that? Is that not corruption?
In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?
So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe -- where the money's going and what can be done to stop it.
I'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank, on asset recovery, trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries' moneys -- to get that sent back.
Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back, it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together.
The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.
Africans, after -- they're tired, we're tired of being the subject of everybody's charity and care.
We are grateful, but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.
And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us. We have to do it.
We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.
We have to reform our economies, change our leadership, become more democratic, be more open to change and to information.
And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.
In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.
I want to tell you that.
One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian, and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people. You'll never be bored.
What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves.
And with the support of a leader who was willing, at the time, to do the reforms, we put forward a comprehensive reform program, which we developed ourselves.
Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank, where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.
No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.
We put together a program that would, one: get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.
The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetent.
So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.
We -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.
Can you believe that prior to this reform -- which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister -- we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?
Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.
You couldn't get it. You had to bribe.
You had to do everything to get your phone.
When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector, we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.
Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world, after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people.
The smartest one, first to come in, was the MTN company of South Africa.
And in the three years that I was Finance Minister, they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country, with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.
So the market is there.
When they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.
Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies, and three or four others have come in.
But there's a huge market out there, and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.
So privatization is one of the things we've done.
The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better.
Because nobody's going to help you and support you if you're not managing your own finances well.
And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.
So what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule that de-linked our budget from the oil price.
Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in, because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector in the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil.
We de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price.
We didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.
But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development -- where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.
When they crashed, we crashed.
And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.
That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left, 27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves -- when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.
By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances.
And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.
Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy.
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.
And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade to about 6.5 percent now.
So all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.
And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent.
As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction, and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro-economy straightened out, the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.
We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said.
We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible, that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world.
We have opportunities in housing and real estate.
There was nothing in a country of 140 million people -- no shopping malls as you know them here.
This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people.
And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected.
So, huge things in construction, real estate, mortgage markets. Financial services: we had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital -- share capital.
And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.
The banks -- these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.
Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million.
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million.
And I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.
We are doing the same with the insurance sector.
So in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.
In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.
And that's what many people know East Africa for: the wildlife, the elephants, and so on.
But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important.
So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent.
A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000, more than two-thirds of African countries have had multi-party democratic elections.
Not all of them have been perfect, or will be, but the trend is very clear.
I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years, the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries.
So it's clear that things are changing.
Conflicts are down on the continent; from about 12 conflicts a decade ago, we are down to three or four conflicts -- one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.
And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent, it looks like the entire continent is affected.
But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries, not one country.
And if we are down to three or four conflicts, it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable, growing, exciting economies where there's plenty of opportunity.
And I want to just make one point about this investment.
The best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet.
And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.
There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine.
But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school, that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet, isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?
And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women.
I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time.
Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.
It says, "Africa: Open for Business."
And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year.
Understand that the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.
But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.
One of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi, making children's clothes -- which she started as a hobby and grew into a business.
Mixing African materials, such as we have, with materials from elsewhere.
So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys, with African material mixed in. Very creative designs, has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.
For 10,000 pieces.
So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.
And the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard.
I could go on giving examples: Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.
However, many of these are starved for capital to expand, because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.
Nobody thinks there's opportunity.
But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now, will miss it forever.
So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.
Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world, who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed, and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income.
So I invite you to explore the opportunities.
When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully, because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent, for the people and for yourselves.
Thank you very much.

I want you to take a look at this baby.
What you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch.
But today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see -- what's going on up in that little brain of hers.
The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science.
And what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the "celestial openness" of the child's mind.
What we see here is a mother in India, and she's speaking Koro, which is a newly discovered language.
And she's talking to her baby.
What this mother -- and the 800 people who speak Koro in the world -- understands [is] that, to preserve this language, they need to speak it to the babies.
And therein lies a critical puzzle.
Why is it that you can't preserve a language by speaking to you and I, to the adults?
Well, it's got to do with your brain.
What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning.
The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis.
And you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language.
Babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven, and then there's a systematic decline.
After puberty, we fall off the map.
No scientists dispute this curve, but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way.
Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development -- and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language.
We think, by studying how the sounds are learned, we'll have a model for the rest of language, and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social, emotional and cognitive development.
So we've been studying the babies using a technique that we're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages.
The baby sits on a parent's lap, and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes -- like from "ah" to "ee."
If they do so at the appropriate time, the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum.
A six-monther adores the task.
What have we learned?
Well, babies all over the world are what I like to describe as "citizens of the world."
They can discriminate all the sounds of all languages, no matter what country we're testing and what language we're using, and that's remarkable because you and I can't do that.
We're culture-bound listeners.
We can discriminate the sounds of our own language, but not those of foreign languages.
So the question arises: when do those citizens of the world turn into the language-bound listeners that we are?
And the answer: before their first birthdays.
What you see here is performance on that head-turn task for babies tested in Tokyo and the United States, here in Seattle, as they listened to "ra" and "la" -- sounds important to English, but not to Japanese.
So at six to eight months the babies are totally equivalent.
Two months later something incredible occurs.
The babies in the United States are getting a lot better, babies in Japan are getting a lot worse, but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn.
So the question is: what's happening during this critical two-month period?
This is the critical period for sound development, but what's going on up there?
So there are two things going on.
The first is that the babies are listening intently to us, and they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk -- they're taking statistics.
So listen to two mothers speaking motherese -- the universal language we use when we talk to kids -- first in English and then in Japanese.
English Mother: Ah, I love your big blue eyes -- so pretty and nice.
Japanese Mother: [Japanese] Patricia Kuhl: During the production of speech, when babies listen, what they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear.
And those distributions grow.
And what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics, and the statistics of Japanese and English are very, very different.
English has a lot of Rs and Ls.
The distribution shows.
And the distribution of Japanese is totally different, where we see a group of intermediate sounds, which is known as the Japanese "R."
So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture-bound listeners that we are.
But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics.
We're governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development.
So what we're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about.
We're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize.
It's raising lots of questions about bilingual people.
Bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between them, one after the other, depending on who they're speaking to.
So we asked ourselves, can the babies take statistics on a brand new language?
And we tested this by exposing American babies who'd never heard a second language to Mandarin for the first time during the critical period.
We knew that, when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle on the Mandarin sounds, they showed the same pattern.
Six to eight months, they're totally equivalent.
Two months later, something incredible happens.
But the Taiwanese babies are getting better, not the American babies.
What we did was expose American babies during this period to Mandarin.
It was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions.
Here's what it looked like in the laboratory.
Mandarin Speaker: [Mandarin] PK: So what have we done to their little brains?
We had to run a control group to make sure that just coming into the laboratory didn't improve your Mandarin skills.
So a group of babies came in and listened to English.
And we can see from the graph that exposure to English didn't improve their Mandarin.
But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.
They were as good as the babies in Taiwan who'd been listening for 10-and-a-half months.
What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language.
Whatever you put in front of them, they'll take statistics on.
But we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise.
So we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage, the same 12 sessions, but over a television set and another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen.
What did we do to their brains?
What you see here is the audio result -- no learning whatsoever -- and the video result -- no learning whatsoever.
It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics.
The social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics.
We want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions, as opposed to in front of human beings.
Thankfully, we have a new machine, magnetoencephalography, that allows us to do this.
It looks like a hair dryer from Mars.
But it's completely safe, completely non-invasive and silent.
We're looking at millimeter accuracy with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy using 306 SQUIDs -- these are Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices -- to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking.
We're the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine while they are learning.
So this is little Emma.
She's a six-monther.
And she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears.
You can see, she can move around.
We're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap, so she's free to move completely unconstrained.
It's a technical tour de force.
What are we seeing?
We're seeing the baby brain.
As the baby hears a word in her language the auditory areas light up, and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence, getting the brain coordinated with its different areas, and causality, one brain area causing another to activate.
We are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child's brain development.
We're going to be able to see a child's brain as they experience an emotion, as they learn to speak and read, as they solve a math problem, as they have an idea.
And we're going to be able to invent brain-based interventions for children who have difficulty learning.
Just as the poets and writers described, we're going to be able to see, I think, that wondrous openness, utter and complete openness, of the mind of a child.
In investigating the child's brain, we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human, and in the process, we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives.
Thank you.

I want to address the issue of compassion.
Compassion has many faces.
Some of them are fierce; some of them are wrathful; some of them are tender; some of them are wise.
A line that the Dalai Lama once said, he said, "Love and compassion are necessities.
They are not luxuries.
Without them, humanity cannot survive."
And I would suggest, it is not only humanity that won't survive, but it is all species on the planet, as we've heard today.
It is the big cats, and it's the plankton.
Two weeks ago, I was in Bangalore in India.
I was so privileged to be able to teach in a hospice on the outskirts of Bangalore.
And early in the morning, I went into the ward.
In that hospice, there were 31 men and women who were actively dying.
And I walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly, fragile, obviously in the latter phase of active dying.
I looked into her face.
I looked into the face of her son sitting next to her, and his face was just riven with grief and confusion.
And I remembered a line from the Mahabharata, the great Indian epic: "What is the most wondrous thing in the world, Yudhisthira?"
And Yudhisthira replied, "The most wondrous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we don't realize it can happen to us."
I looked up.
Tending those 31 dying people were young women from villages around Bangalore.
I looked into the face of one of these women, and I saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present.
I watched her hands as she bathed an old man.
My gaze went to another young woman as she wiped the face of another dying person.
And it reminded me of something that I had just been present for.
Every year or so, I have the privilege of taking clinicians into the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.
And we run clinics in these very remote regions where there's no medical care whatsoever.
And on the first day at Simikot in Humla, far west of Nepal, the most impoverished region of Nepal, an old man came in clutching a bundle of rags.
And he walked in, and somebody said something to him, we realized he was deaf, and we looked into the rags, and there was this pair of eyes.
The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned.
Again, the eyes and hands of Avalokiteshvara.
It was the young women, the health aids, who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds.
I know those hands and eyes; they touched me as well.
They touched me at that time.
They have touched me throughout my 68 years.
They touched me when I was four and I lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed.
And my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me.
And that woman did not have sentimental compassion.
She had phenomenal strength.
And it was really her strength, I believe, that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life.
So we can ask: What is compassion comprised of?
And there are various facets.
And there's referential and non-referential compassion.
But first, compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering.
It is that ability to really stand strong and to recognize also that I'm not separate from this suffering.
But that is not enough, because compassion, which activates the motor cortex, means that we aspire, we actually aspire to transform suffering.
And if we're so blessed, we engage in activities that transform suffering.
But compassion has another component, and that component is really essential.
That component is that we cannot be attached to outcome.
Now I worked with dying people for over 40 years.
I had the privilege of working on death row in a maximum security [prison] for six years.
And I realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience, from working with dying people and training caregivers, that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe.
And when I worked in the prison system, it was so clear to me, this: that many of us in this room, and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row, the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered.
That compassion is actually an inherent human quality.
It is there within every human being.
But the conditions for compassion to be activated, to be aroused, are particular conditions.
I had that condition, to a certain extent, from my own childhood illness.
Eve Ensler, whom you'll hear later, has had that condition activated amazingly in her through the various waters of suffering that she has been through.
And what is fascinating is that compassion has enemies, and those enemies are things like pity, moral outrage, fear.
And you know, we have a society, a world, that is paralyzed by fear.
And in that paralysis, of course, our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed.
The very word terror is global.
The very feeling of terror is global.
So our work, in a certain way, is to address this imago, this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe.
Now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities.
For example: A person who is cultivating compassion, when they are in the presence of suffering, they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do.
However, they return to baseline a lot sooner.
This is called resilience.
Many of us think that compassion drains us, but I promise you it is something that truly enlivens us.
Another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what's called neural integration.
It hooks up all parts of the brain.
Another, which has been discovered by various researchers at Emory and at Davis and so on, is that compassion enhances our immune system.
Hey, we live in a very noxious world.
Most of us are shrinking in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons, of the toxins of our world.
But compassion, the generation of compassion, actually mobilizes our immunity.
You know, if compassion is so good for us, I have a question.
Why don't we train our children in compassion?
If compassion is so good for us, why don't we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they're supposed to do, which is to really transform suffering?
And if compassion is so good for us, why don't we vote on compassion?
Why don't we vote for people in our government based on compassion, so that we can have a more caring world?
In Buddhism, we say, "it takes a strong back and a soft front."
It takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions.
And that is the mental quality of equanimity.
But it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is, to have an undefended heart.
And the archetype of this in Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara, Kuan-Yin.
It's a female archetype: she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world.
She stands with 10,000 arms, and in every hand, there is an instrument of liberation, and in the palm of every hand, there are eyes, and these are the eyes of wisdom.
I say that, for thousands of years, women have lived, exemplified, met in intimacy, the archetype of Avalokitesvara, of Kuan-Yin, she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world.
Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered, unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is.
They have infused societies with kindness, and we have really felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half.
And they have actualized compassion through direct action.
Jody Williams called it: It's good to meditate.
I'm sorry, you've got to do a little bit of that, Jody.
Step back, give your mother a break, okay.
But the other side of the equation is you've got to come out of your cave.
You have to come into the world like Asanga did, who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha after 12 years sitting in the cave.
He said, "I'm out of here."
He's going down the path.
He sees something in the path.
He looks, it's a dog, he drops to his knees.
He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg.
The wound is just filled with maggots.
He puts out his tongue in order to remove the maggots, so as not to harm them.
And at that moment, the dog transformed into the Buddha of love and kindness.
I believe that women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men -- with their fathers, with their sons, with their brothers, with the plumbers, the road builders, the caregivers, the doctors, the lawyers, with our president, and with all beings.
The women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire.
May we actualize that capacity for women everywhere.
Thank you.

I'm going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life.
15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend.
At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners in Italian jails.
He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades.
Now, as many of you may remember, the Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization which was very active in Italy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s.
As part of their strategy the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers.
They sat in silence through their trails, waving occasionally at family and friends.
In 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle.
And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk, and tell their story.
And I was one of those people.
When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me, he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported my name.
In particular, one person had put it forward.
She was my childhood friend.
She had joined the Red Brigades and became a leader of the organization.
Naturally, I didn't know that until the day she was arrested.
In fact, I read it in the newspaper.
At the time of the phone call I just had a baby, I successfully completed a management buyout to the company I was working with, and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high-security prisons.
But this is exactly what I did because I wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist, and why she'd never tried to recruit me.
So, this is exactly what I did.
Now, I found the answer very quickly.
I actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist.
The center committee of the Red Brigades had judged me too single-minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorist.
My friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders.
She also embraced violence.
Because she believed that the only way to unblock what, at the time, was known as a blocked democracy, Italy, a country run by the same party for 35 years was the arms struggle.
At the same time, while I was interviewing the Red Brigades, I also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology, but actually was ruled by economics.
They were constantly short of cash.
They were constantly searching for cash.
Now, contrary to what many people believe, terrorism is actually a very expensive business.
I'll give you an idea.
In the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars.
This is roughly between 100 and 150 million, today.
Now, you know, if you live underground it's really hard to produce this amount of money.
But this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades, and then, later on, other arms organizations, including members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East, everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology, or politics.
Because they had no idea.
The political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership, which, generally, is never more than five to seven people.
All the others do, day in and day out, is search for money.
Once, for example, I was interviewing this part-timer from the Red Brigades.
It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.
He was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat.
And he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the Red Brigades and he went sailing, every summer, back and forth from Lebanon, where he would pick up Soviet weapons from the PLO, and then carry them all the way to Sardinia where the other arms organization from Europe would go and take their share of the arms.
For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee, which went to fund their organization.
So, because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms, all of the sudden I thought, maybe there is something here.
Maybe there is a link, a commercial link, between one organization and another one.
But it was only when I interviewed Mario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades, the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro, Italian former prime minister, that I finally realized that terrorism is actually business.
I was having lunch with him in a high-security prison in Italy.
And as we were eating, I had the distinct feeling that I was back in the city of London, having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist.
This guy thought in the same way I did.
So, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism.
Naturally, nobody wanted to fund my research.
In fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy.
You know, that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism.
So, in the end, I took a decision that, in retrospect, did change my life.
I sold my company, and funded the research myself.
And what I discovered is this parallel reality, another international economic system, which runs parallel to our own, which has been created by arms organizations since the end of World War II.
And what is even more shocking is that this system has followed, step by step, the evolution of our own system, of our Western capitalism.
And there are three main stages.
The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.
The second one is the privatization of terrorism.
And the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism.
So, state sponsor of terrorism, feature of the Cold War.
This is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy, along the periphery of the sphere of influence, fully funding arms organizations.
A mix of legal and illegal activities is used.
So, the link between crime and terror is established very early on.
And here is the best example, the Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA, legally funded by the U.S. Congress, illegally funded by the Reagan administration via covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair.
Then comes the late 1970s, early '80s, and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism.
So, they gain independence from the sponsor, and start funding themselves.
Now, again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities.
So, Arafat used to get a percentage of the smuggling of hashish from Bekáa Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria.
And the IRA, which control the private transportation system in Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing.
So, every single time that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast without knowing, actually, was funding the IRA.
But the great change came, of course, with globalization and deregulation.
This is when arms organization were able to link up, also financially, with each other.
But above all, they started to do serious business with the world of crime.
And together they money-laundered their dirty business through the same channel.
This is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization Al Qaeda.
This is an organization that can raise money across border.
But also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country.
Now, deregulation also brought back rogue economics.
So what is rogue economics?
Rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history.
It comes back at times of great transformation, globalization being one of those transformations.
It is at this times in which politics actually loses control of the economy, and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us.
It has happened before in history.
It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire.
It has happened with Industrial Revolution.
And it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall.
Now, I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime, terror, and illegal economy, before 9-11.
And it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars.
It is trillions, it's not billions.
This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom, soon will be more, considering where this country is going.
Now, until 9-11, the bulk of all this money flew into the U.S. economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the United States.
The entry point, of course, of most of this money were the off-shore facilities.
So, this was a vital injection of cash into the U.S. economy.
Now, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply, the U.S. money supply is the amount of dollars that the Federal Reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars, which, of course, reflects the growth of the economy.
So, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the United States, never to come back.
These were money taken out in suitcases or in containers, in cash of course.
These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers.
These were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror, illegal and criminal economy.
So, you see, what is the relationship?
The United States actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world.
What does it mean? That means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have.
It can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world.
This privilege is called seigniorage.
No other country can do that.
All the other countries, for example the United Kingdom, can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders.
So, here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy.
The U.S. in the 1990s was borrowing against the growth of the terror, illegal and criminal economy.
This is how close we are with this world.
Now, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11, because George Bush launched the War on Terror.
Part of the War on Terror was the introduction of the Patriot Act.
Now, many of you know that the Patriot Act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of Americans in order to protect them against terrorism.
But there is a section of the Patriot Act which refers specifically to finance.
And it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation.
What the Patriot Act did was to prohibit U.S. bank, and U.S.-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.
It closed that door between the money laundering in dollars, and the U.S. economy.
It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world.
Now, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking.
All the bankers said to their clients, "Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else."
Now, the Euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment.
And this is what people did.
Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority to check their relationship, to monitor their relationship with their clientele.
The same thing happened, of course, in the world of crime and terror.
People simply moved their money-laundering activities away from the United States into Europe.
Why did this happen? This happened because the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation.
It was introduced only in the United States.
And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars.
In Europe, a similar legislation was not introduced.
So, within six months Europe became the epicenter of the money-laundering activities of the world.
So, this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror, and our own life.
So, why did I tell you this story?
I told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers, including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family.
You got to question everything that is told to you, including what I just told you today.
This is the only way for you to step into the dark side, and have a look at it.
And believe me, it's going to be scary.
It's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you.
And, above all, it's not going to be boring.

Hi, my name is Roz Savage and I row across oceans.
Four years ago, I rowed solo across the Atlantic, and since then, I've done two out of three stages across the Pacific, from San Francisco to Hawaii and from Hawaii to Kiribati.
And tomorrow, I'll be leaving this boat to fly back to Kiribati to continue with the third and final stage of my row across the Pacific.
Cumulatively, I will have rowed over 8,000 miles, taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than 312 days alone on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat.
This has given me a very special relationship with the ocean.
We have a bit of a love/hate thing going on.
I feel a bit about it like I did about a very strict math teacher that I once had at school.
I didn't always like her, but I did respect her, and she taught me a heck of a lot.
So today I'd like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me, and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now.
Now, some of you might be thinking, "Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower.
Isn't she meant to be about this tall and about this wide and maybe look a bit more like these guys?"
You'll notice, they've all got something that I don't.
Well, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards.
And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean, I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard, and I hope that it remains that way.
For a long time, I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure.
The story that I told myself was that adventurers looked like this.
I didn't look the part.
I thought there were them and there were us, and I was not one of them.
So for 11 years, I conformed.
I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do.
I was working in an office in London as a management consultant.
And I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me.
But that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years, until I reached my mid-30s and I thought, "You know, I'm not getting any younger.
I feel like I've got a purpose in this life, and I don't know what it is, but I'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it.
So, fast forward a few years.
I'd gone through some changes.
To try and answer that question of, "What am I supposed to be doing with my life?"
I sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary, the one that I wanted, a life of adventure, and the one that I was actually heading for which was a nice, normal, pleasant life, but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life.
I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.
And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking, "Oh boy, I'm on totally the wrong track here.
If I carry on living as I am now, I'm just not going to end up where I want to be in five years, or 10 years, or at the end of my life."
I made a few changes, let go of some loose trappings of my old life, and through a bit of a leap of logic, decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean.
The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua, it's about 3,000 miles, and it turned out to be the hardest thing I had ever done.
Sure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone, but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is, by definition, extremely uncomfortable.
And my timing was not great either: 2005, when I did the Atlantic, was the year of Hurricane Katrina.
There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic than ever before, since records began.
And pretty early on, those storms started making their presence known.
All four of my oars broke before I reached halfway across.
Oars are not supposed to look like this.
But what can you do? You're in the middle of the ocean.
Oars are your only means of propulsion.
So I just had to look around the boat and figure out what I was going to use to fix up these oars so that I could carry on.
So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the boat hook to the oars to reinforce it.
Then, when that gave out, I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those.
And then when those gave out, I cannibalized one of the broken oars.
I'd never been very good at fixing stuff when I was living my old life, but it's amazing how resourceful you can become when you're in the middle of the ocean and there's only one way to get to the other side.
And the oars kind of became a symbol of just in how many ways I went beyond what I thought were my limits.
I suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my bottom.
I really struggled psychologically, totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge, realizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour, 3,000 miles was going to take me a very, very long time.
There were so many times when I thought I'd hit that limit, but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy.
And eventually after 103 days at sea, I arrived in Antigua.
I don't think I've ever felt so happy in my entire life.
It was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an Oscar all rolled into one.
I was euphoric.
And to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering, I just felt like a movie star.
It was absolutely wonderful.
And I really learned then that, the bigger the challenge, the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it.
So this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind.
Number one that I get asked: What do you eat?
A few freeze-dried meals, but mostly I try and eat much more unprocessed foods.
So I grow my own beansprouts.
I eat fruits and nut bars, a lot of nuts.
And generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter at the other end.
Question number two: How do you sleep?
With my eyes shut. Ha-ha.
I suppose what you mean is: What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping?
Well, I plan my route so that I'm drifting with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping.
On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles in the right direction.
Worst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.
That's a bad day at the office.
What do I wear?
Mostly, a baseball cap, rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown, depending on whether I went backwards overnight -- and lots of sun lotion.
Do I have a chase boat?
No I don't. I'm totally self-supporting out there.
I don't see anybody for the whole time that I'm at sea, generally.
And finally: Am I crazy?
Well, I leave that one up to you to judge.
So, how do you top rowing across the Atlantic?
Well, naturally, you decide to row across the Pacific.
Well, I thought the Atlantic was big, but the Pacific is really, really big.
I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps.
I don't know for sure that the Brits invented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so: we are right in the middle, and we've cut the Pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world.
Whereas if you look in Google Earth, this is how the Pacific looks.
It pretty much covers half the planet.
You can just see a little bit of North America up here and a sliver of Australia down there.
It is really big -- 65 million square miles -- and to row in a straight line across it would be about 8,000 miles.
Unfortunately, ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line.
By the time I get to Australia, if I get to Australia, I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all.
So, because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past Hawaii without dropping in, I decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments.
The first attempt didn't go so well.
In 2007, I did a rather involuntary capsize drill three times in 24 hours.
A bit like being in a washing machine.
Boat got a bit dinged up, so did I.
I blogged about it. Unfortunately, somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided that this damsel was in distress and needed saving.
The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead.
I tried to tell them to go away.
We had a bit of a battle of wills.
I lost and got airlifted.
Awful, really awful.
It was one of the worst feelings of my life, as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the 20 foot waves and wondering if I would ever see her again.
So I had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before I could get back out onto the ocean again.
But what do you do?
Fall down nine times, get up 10.
So, the following year, I set out and, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.
But it was not without misadventure.
My watermaker broke, only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.
Powered by my solar panels, it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater.
But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean, which is what happened to it.
Fortunately, help was at hand.
There was another unusual boat out there at the same time, doing as I was doing, bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch, that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas, with an estimated 3.5 million tons of trash in it, circulating at the center of that North Pacific Gyre.
So, to make the point, these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash, 15,000 empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons.
They were going very slowly.
Partly, they'd had a bit of a delay.
They'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone, and they were starting to sink.
So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up.
But, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves, luckily, our courses were converging.
They were running out of food; I was running out of water.
So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.
And it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge.
I was doing a pathetically slow speed of about 1.3 knots, and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4: it was like two snails in a mating dance.
But, eventually, we did manage to meet up and Joel hopped overboard, caught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi, which was the best food I'd had in, ooh, at least three months.
Fortunately, the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.
When they opened this one up, they found its stomach was full of plastic.
And this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance.
It leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it, and then we come along and eat that poor critter, and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well.
So there are very real implications for human health.
I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive.
And, the following year, set out on the second stage of the Pacific, from Hawaii down to Tarawa.
And you'll notice something about Tarawa; it is very low-lying.
It's that little green sliver on the horizon, which makes them very nervous about rising oceans.
This is big trouble for these guys.
They've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level.
And also, as an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change, they're expecting more waves to come in over the fringing reef, which will contaminate their fresh water supply.
I had a meeting with the president there, who told me about his exit strategy for his country.
He expects that within the next 50 years, the 100,000 people that live there will have to relocate to New Zealand or Australia.
And that made me think about how would I feel if Britain was going to disappear under the waves; if the places where I'd been born and gone to school and got married, if all those places were just going to disappear forever.
How, literally, ungrounded that would make me feel.
Very shortly, I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia, and if I'm successful, I'll be the first woman ever to row solo all the way across the Pacific.
And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues, to bring a human face to the ocean.
If the Atlantic was about my inner journey, discovering my own capabilities, maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey, figuring out how I can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world, and to take some of those things that I've learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in.
I think there are probably three key points here.
The first one is about the stories that we tell ourselves.
For so long, I told myself that I couldn't have an adventure because I wasn't six foot tall and athletic and bearded.
And then that story changed.
I found out that people had rowed across oceans.
I even met one of them and she was just about my size.
So even though I didn't grow any taller, I didn't sprout a beard, something had changed: My interior dialogue had changed.
At the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff, that we need oil.
But what about if we just change that story?
We do have alternatives, and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives, those sustainable ones, to create a greener future.
The second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions.
We might think that anything that we do as an individual is just a drop in the ocean, that it can't really make a difference.
But it does. Generally, we haven't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters.
Yes, there have been the Exxon Valdezes and the Chernobyls, but mostly it's been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals, day after day and year after year.
And, by the same token, we can turn that tide.
We can start making better, wiser, more sustainable decisions.
And when we do that, we're not just one person.
Anything that we do spreads ripples.
Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag.
Maybe if we all start doing this, we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the checkout line.
That's just one example.
This is a world-wide community.
The other point: It's about taking responsibility.
For so much of my life, I wanted something else to make me happy.
I thought if I had the right house or the right car or the right man in my life, then I could be happy.
But when I wrote that obituary exercise, I actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that I needed to create my own future.
I couldn't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me.
And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist.
I plan on being around for a long time, and when I'm 90 years old, I want to be happy and healthy.
And it's very difficult to be happy on a planet that's racked with famine and drought.
It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air.
So, shortly, I'm going to be launching a new initiative called Eco-Heroes.
And the idea here is that all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day.
It's meant to be a bit of a game.
We're going to make an iPhone app out of it.
We just want to try and create that awareness because, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world, but that attitude, that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug, that is what could change the world.
I really believe that we stand at a very important point in history.
We have a choice. We've been blessed, or cursed, with free will.
We can choose a greener future, and we can get there if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time.
Thank you.

<title>Roz Savage: Why I'm rowing across the Pacific</title>
<description>Five years ago, Roz Savage quit her high-powered London job to become an ocean rower. She's crossed the Atlantic solo, and just started the third leg of a Pacific solo row, the first for a woman. Why does she do it? Hear her reasons, both deeply personal and urgently activist.</description>
<keywords>adventure,entertainment,global issues,oceans</keywords>

I'm a gamer, so I like to have goals.
I like special missions and secret objectives.
So here's my special mission for this talk: I'm going to try to increase the life span of every single person in this room by seven and a half minutes.
Literally, you will live seven and half minutes longer than you would have otherwise, just because you watched this talk.
Okay, some of you are looking a little bit skeptical.
That's okay, because check it out -- I have math to prove that it is possible.
And it won't make a lot of sense now.
I'll explain it all later, just pay attention to the number at the bottom: plus-7.68245837 minutes that will be my gift to you if I'm successful in my mission.
Now, you have a secret mission too.
Your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes.
And I think you should do something unusual with them, because these are bonus minutes. You weren't going to have them anyway.
Now, because I'm a game designer, you might be thinking to yourself, I know what she wants us to do with those minutes, she wants us to spend them playing games.
Now this is a totally reasonable assumption, given that I have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games.
For example, in my first TEDTalk, I did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games.
Now, 21 billion hours, it's a lot of time.
It's so much time, in fact, that the number one unsolicited comment that I have heard from people all over the world since I gave that talk, is this: Jane, games are great and all, but on your deathbed, are you really going to wish you spent more time playing Angry Birds?
This idea is so pervasive -- that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret -- that I hear it literally everywhere I go.
For example, true story: Just a few weeks ago, this cab driver, upon finding out that a friend and I were in town for a game developer's conference, turned around and said -- and I quote -- "I hate games. Waste of life. Imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time."
Now, I want to take this problem seriously.
I mean, I want games to be a force for good in the world.
I don't want gamers to regret the time they spent playing, time that I encouraged them to spend.
So I have been thinking about this question a lot lately.
When we're on our deathbeds, will we regret the time we spent playing games?
Now, this may surprise you, but it turns out there is actually some scientific research on this question.
It's true. Hospice workers, the people who take care of us at the end of our lives, recently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets that people say when they are literally on their deathbeds.
And that's what I want to share with you today -- the top five regrets of the dying.
Number one: I wish I hadn't worked so hard.
Number two: I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
Number three: I wish I had let myself be happier.
Number four: I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self.
And number five: I wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams, instead of what others expected of me.
Now, as far as I know, no one ever told one of the hospice workers, I wish I'd spent more time playing video games, but when I hear these top five regrets of the dying, I can't help but hear five deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill.
For example, I wish I hadn't worked so hard.
For many people, this means, I wish I'd spent more time with my family, with my kids when they were growing up.
Well, we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits.
A recent study from Brigham Young University School of Family life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real-life relationships with them.
I wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends.
Well, hundreds of millions of people use social games like FarmVille or Words With Friends to stay in daily contact with real-life friends and family.
A recent study from [University of Michigan] showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship-management tools.
They help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from, if we weren't playing games together.
I wish I'd let myself be happier.
Well, here I can't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials recently conducted at East Carolina University that showed that online games can outperform pharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression.
Just 30 minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long-term increases in happiness.
I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self.
Well, avatars are a way to express our true selves, our most heroic, idealized version of who we might become.
You can see that in this alter ego portrait by Robbie Cooper of a gamer with his avatar.
And Stanford University has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar changes how we think and act in real life, making us more courageous, more ambitious, more committed to our goals.
I wish I'd led a life true to my dreams, and not what others expected of me.
Are games doing this yet? I'm not sure, so I've left a question mark, a Super Mario question mark.
And we're going to come back to this one.
But in the mean time, perhaps you're wondering, who is this game designer to be talking to us about deathbed regrets?
And it's true, I've never worked in a hospice, I've never been on my deathbed.
But recently I did spend three months in bed, wanting to die.
Really wanting to die.
Now let me tell you that story.
It started two years ago, when I hit my head and got a concussion.
Now the concussion didn't heal properly, and after 30 days I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches, nausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog.
My doctor told me that in order to heal my brain, I had to rest it.
So I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms.
For me that meant no reading, no writing, no video games, no work or email, no running, no alcohol, no caffeine.
In other words -- and I think you see where this is going -- no reason to live.
Of course it's meant to be funny, but in all seriousness, suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries.
It happens to one in three, and it happened to me.
My brain started telling me, Jane, you want to die.
It said, you're never going to get better.
It said, the pain will never end.
And these voices became so persistent and so persuasive that I started to legitimately fear for my life, which is the time that I said to myself after 34 days -- and I will never forget this moment -- I said, I am either going to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game.
Now, why a game?
I knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade that when we play a game -- and this is in the scientific literature -- we tackle tough challenges with more creativity, more determination, more optimism, and we're more likely to reach out to others for help.
And I wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real-life challenge, so I created a role-playing recovery game called Jane the Concussion Slayer.
Now this became my new secret identity, and the first thing I did as a slayer was call my twin sister -- I have an identical twin sister named Kelly -- and tell her, I'm playing a game to heal my brain, and I want you to play with me.
This was an easier way to ask for help.
She became my first ally in the game, my husband Kiyash joined next, and together we identified and battled the bad guys.
Now this was anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process, things like bright lights and crowded spaces.
We also collected and activated power-ups.
This was anything I could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good, just a little bit productive.
Things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes, or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once.
Now the game was that simple: Adopt a secret identity, recruit your allies, battle the bad guys, activate the power-ups.
But even with a game so simple, within just a couple days of starting to play, that fog of depression and anxiety went away. It just vanished. It felt like a miracle.
Now it wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms.
That lasted for more than a year, and it was the hardest year of my life by far.
But even when I still had the symptoms, even while I was still in pain, I stopped suffering.
Now what happened next with the game surprised me.
I put up some blog posts and videos online, explaining how to play.
But not everybody has a concussion, obviously, not everyone wants to be "the slayer," so I renamed the game SuperBetter.
And soon I started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity, recruiting their own allies, and they were getting "super better" facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain, depression and Crohn's disease.
Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS.
And I could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me.
They talked about feeling stronger and braver.
They talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family.
And they even talked about feeling happier, even though they were in pain, even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives.
Now at the time, I'm thinking to myself, what is going on here?
I mean, how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious, and in some cases life-and-death, circumstances?
I mean, if it hadn't worked for me, there's no way I would have believed it was possible.
Well, it turns out there's some science here too.
Some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event.
And that's what was happening to us.
The game was helping us experience what scientists call post-traumatic growth, which is not something we usually hear about.
We usually hear about post-traumatic stress disorder.
But scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely.
Instead, we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives.
Here are the top five things that people with post-traumatic growth say: My priorities have changed. I'm not afraid to do what makes me happy.
I feel closer to my friends and family.
I understand myself better. I know who I really am now.
I have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life.
I'm better able to focus on my goals and dreams.
Now, does this sound familiar?
It should, because the top five traits of post-traumatic growth are essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying.
Now this is interesting, right?
It seems that somehow, a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets.
But how does it work?
How do you get from trauma to growth?
Or better yet, is there a way to get all the benefits of post-traumatic growth without the trauma, without having to hit your head in the first place?
That would be good, right?
I wanted to understand the phenomenon better, so I devoured the scientific literature, and here's what I learned.
There are four kinds of strength, or resilience, that contribute to post-traumatic growth, and there are scientifically validated activities that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience, and you don't need a trauma to do it.
Now, I could tell you what these four types of strength are, but I'd rather you experience them firsthand.
I'd rather we all start building them up together right now.
So here's what we're going to do.
We're going to play a quick game together.
This is where you earn those seven and a half minutes of bonus life that I promised you earlier.
All you have to do is successfully complete the first four SuperBetter quests.
And I feel like you can do it. I have confidence in you.
So, everybody ready? This is your first quest. Here we go.
Pick one: Stand up and take three steps, or make your hands into fists, raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds. Go!
All right, I like the people doing both. You are overachievers.
Very good.
Well done, everyone. Now that is worth plus-one physical resilience, which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster.
Now we know from the research that the number one thing you can do to boost your physical resilience is to not sit still.
That's all it takes.
Every single second that you are not sitting still, you are actively improving the health of your heart, and your lungs and brains.
Everybody ready for your next quest?
I want you to snap your fingers exactly 50 times, or count backwards from 100 by seven, like this: 100, 93 ...
Go!
Don't give up.
Don't let the people counting down from 100 interfere with your counting to 50.
Nice. Wow. That's the first time I've ever seen that.
Bonus physical resilience. Well done, everyone.
Now that's worth plus-one mental resilience, which means you have more mental focus, more discipline, determination and willpower.
We know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle.
It gets stronger the more you exercise it.
So tackling a tiny challenge without giving up, even one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly 50 times or counting backwards from 100 by seven is actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower.
So good job. Quest number three.
Pick one: Now because of the room we're in, fate's really determined this for you, but here are the two options.
If you're inside, find a window and look out of it.
If you're outside, find a window and look in.
Or do a quick YouTube or Google image search for "baby [your favorite animal.]" Now, you could do this on your phones, or you could just shout out some baby animals, I'm going to find some and put them on the screen for us.
So, what do we want to see?
Sloth, giraffe, elephant, snake. Okay, let's see what we got.
Baby dolphin and baby llamas. Everybody look.
Got that?
Okay, one more. Baby elephant.
We're clapping for that?
That's amazing.
All right, now what we're just feeling there is plus-one emotional resilience, which means you have the ability to provoke powerful, positive emotions like curiosity or love, which we feel when we look at baby animals, when you need them most.
And here's a secret from the scientific literature for you.
If you can manage to experience three positive emotions for every one negative emotion over the course of an hour, a day, a week, you dramatically improve your health and your ability to successfully tackle any problem you're facing.
And this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio.
It's my favorite SuperBetter trick, so keep it up.
All right, pick one, last quest: Shake someone's hand for six seconds, or send someone a quick thank you by text, email, Facebook or Twitter. Go!
Looking good, looking good.
Nice, nice.
Keep it up. I love it!
All right, everybody, that is plus-one social resilience, which means you actually get more strength from your friends, your neighbors, your family, your community.
Now, a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude.
Touch is even better.
Here's one more secret for you: Shaking someone's hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream, now that's the trust hormone.
That means that all of you who just shook hands are biochemically primed to like and want to help each other.
This will linger during the break, so take advantage of the networking opportunities.
Okay, well you have successfully completed your four quests, so let's see if I've successfully completed my mission to give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life.
And here's where I get to share one more little bit of science with you.
It turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience -- physical, mental, emotional and social -- live 10 years longer than everyone else.
So this is true.
If you are regularly achieving the three-to-one positive emotion ratio, if you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time, if you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day, if you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower, you will live 10 years longer than everyone else, and here's where that math I showed you earlier comes in.
So, the average life expectancy in the U.S. and the U.K. is 78.1 years, but we know from more than 1,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies that you can add 10 years of life to that by boosting your four types of resilience.
So every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience, you're actually earning .128 more years of life or 46 more days of life, or 67,298 more minutes of life, which means every single day, you are earning 184 minutes of life, or every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience, like we just did together, you are earning 7.68245837 more minutes of life.
Congratulations, those seven and a half minutes are all yours. You totally earned them.
Yeah! Awesome.
Wait, wait, wait.
You still have your special mission, your secret mission.
How are you going to spend these seven and a half minutes of bonus life?
Well, here's my suggestion.
These seven and a half bonus minutes are kind of like genie's wishes.
You can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes.
Pretty clever, right?
So, if you spend these seven and a half minutes today doing something that makes you happy, or that gets you physically active, or puts you in touch with someone you care about, or even just tackling a tiny challenge, you are going to boost your resilience, so you're going to earn more minutes.
And the good news is, you can keep going like that.
Every hour of the day, every day of your life, all the way to your deathbed, which will now be 10 years later than it would have otherwise.
And when you get there, more than likely, you will not have any of those top five regrets, because you will have built up the strength and resilience to lead a life truer to your dreams.
And with 10 extra years, you might even have enough time to play a few more games.
Thank you.

I'm here today, as June said, to talk about a project that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years.
We're crocheting a coral reef.
And it's a project that we've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world, who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project, in many of its different aspects.
It's a project that now reaches across three continents, and its roots go into the fields of mathematics, marine biology, feminine handicraft and environmental activism.
It's true.
It's also a project that in a very beautiful way, the development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth, which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in February 2009 -- which, as one of our previous speakers told us, is the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin.
All of this I'm going to get to in the next 18 minutes, I hope.
But let me first begin by showing you some pictures of what this thing looks like.
Just to give you an idea of scale, that installation there is about six feet across, and the tallest models are about two or three feet high.
This is some more images of it.
That one on the right is about five feet high.
The work involves hundreds of different crochet models.
And indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people have contributed all over the world as part of this.
The totality of this project involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor -- 99 percent of it done by women.
On the right hand side, that bit there is part of an installation that is about 12 feet long.
My sister and I started this project in 2005 because in that year, at least in the science press, there was a lot of talk about global warming, and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs.
Corals are very delicate organisms, and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures.
It causes these vast bleaching events that are the first signs of corals of being sick.
And if the bleaching doesn't go away -- if the temperatures don't go down -- reefs start to die.
A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef, particularly in coral reefs all over the world.
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef.
We have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring, which is a little organization we started to promote, to do projects about the aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics.
And I went and put a little announcement up on our site, asking for people to join us in this enterprise.
To our surprise, one of the first people who called was the Andy Warhol Museum.
And they said they were having an exhibition about artists' response to global warming, and they'd like our coral reef to be part of it.
I laughed and said, "Well we've only just started it, you can have a little bit of it."
So in 2007 we had an exhibition, a small exhibition of this crochet reef.
And then some people in Chicago came along and they said, "In late 2007, the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is global warming. And we've got this 3,000 square-foot gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef."
And I, naively by this stage, said, "Oh, yes, sure."
Now I say "naively" because actually my profession is as a science writer.
What I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics.
I've written books about the history of space, the history of physics and religion, and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times.
So I had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.
So I said yes to this proposition.
And I went home, and I told my sister Christine.
And she nearly had a fit because Christine is a professor at one of L.A.'s major art colleges, CalArts, and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.
She thought I'd gone off my head.
But she went into crochet overdrive.
And to cut a long story short, eight months later we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center's 3,000 square foot gallery.
By this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own, which got completely beyond us.
The people in Chicago decided that as well as exhibiting our reefs, what they wanted to do was have the local people there make a reef.
So we went and taught the techniques. We did workshops and lectures.
And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own.
And it was exhibited alongside ours.
There were hundreds of people involved in that.
We got invited to do the whole thing in New York, and in London, and in Los Angeles.
In each of these cities, the local citizens, hundreds and hundreds of them, have made a reef.
And more and more people get involved in this, most of whom we've never met.
So the whole thing has sort of morphed into this organic, ever-evolving creature, that's actually gone way beyond Christine and I.
Now some of you are sitting here thinking, "What planet are these people on?
Why on earth are you crocheting a reef?
Woolenness and wetness aren't exactly two concepts that go together.
Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble?
Cast it in bronze."
But it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure.
The frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals, and kelps, and sponges and nudibranchs, is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry.
And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet. It happens to be a fact.
It's almost impossible to model this structure any other way, and it's almost impossible to do it on computers.
So what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody?
The next few minutes is, we're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug.
This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century.
But not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it.
In 1997 a mathematician at Cornell, Daina Taimina, made the discovery that this structure could actually be done in knitting and crochet.
The first one she did was knitting.
But you get too many stitches on the needle. So she quickly realized crochet was the better thing.
But what she was doing was actually making a model of a mathematical structure, that many mathematicians had thought it was actually impossible to model.
And indeed they thought that anything like this structure was impossible per se.
Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible.
So what is this impossible hyperbolic structure?
Before hyperbolic geometry, mathematicians knew about two kinds of space: Euclidean space, and spherical space.
And they have different properties.
Mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist.
You all have a sense of what a flat space is, Euclidean space is.
But mathematicians formalize this in a particular way.
And what they do is, they do it through the concept of parallel lines.
So here we have a line and a point outside the line.
And Euclid said, "How can I define parallel lines?
I ask the question, how many lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line?"
And you all know the answer. Does someone want to shout it out?
One. Great. Okay.
That's our definition of a parallel line.
It's a definition really of Euclidean space.
But there is another possibility that you all know of: spherical space.
Think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball, the surface of the Earth.
I have a straight line on my spherical surface.
And I have a point outside the line. How many straight lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line?
What do we mean to talk about a straight line on a curved surface?
Now mathematicians have answered that question.
They've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness, it's called a geodesic.
And on the surface of a sphere, a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw.
So it's like the equator or the lines of longitude.
So we ask the question again, "How many straight lines can I draw through the point, but never meet the original line?"
Does someone want to guess?
Zero. Very good.
Now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative.
It's a bit suspicious isn't it? There is two answers to the question so far, Zero and one.
Two answers? There may possibly be a third alternative.
To a mathematician if there are two answers, and the first two are zero and one, there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative.
Does anyone want to guess what it is?
Infinity. You all got it right. Exactly.
There is, there's a third alternative.
This is what it looks like.
There's a straight line, and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line.
This is the drawing.
This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because, like you, they're sitting there feeling bamboozled.
Thinking, how can that be? You're cheating. The lines are curved.
But that's only because I'm projecting it onto a flat surface.
Mathematicians for several hundred years had to really struggle with this.
How could they see this?
What did it mean to actually have a physical model that looked like this?
It's a bit like this: imagine that we'd only ever encountered Euclidean space.
Then our mathematicians come along and said, "There's this thing called a sphere, and the lines come together at the north and south pole."
But you don't know what a sphere looks like.
And someone that comes along and says, "Look here's a ball."
And you go, "Ah! I can see it. I can feel it.
I can touch it. I can play with it."
And that's exactly what happened when Daina Taimina in 1997, showed that you could crochet models in hyperbolic space.
Here is this diagram in crochetness.
I've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface.
And the lines look curved.
But look, I can prove to you that they're straight because I can take any one of these lines, and I can fold along it.
And it's a straight line.
So here, in wool, through a domestic feminine art, is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong.
And you can stitch all sorts of mathematical theorems onto these surfaces.
The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non-Euclidean geometry.
And this is actually the field of mathematics that underlies general relativity and is actually ultimately going to show us about the shape of the universe.
So there is this direct line between feminine handicraft, Euclid and general relativity.
Now, I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible.
Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate -- didn't know it was impossible to violate, and they're simply getting on with it.
They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years.
I once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age.
Their answer was interesting.
They said, "Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs."
And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that.
It also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was, what they thought it could and couldn't do, what they thought it could and couldn't represent.
Even mathematicians, who in some sense are the freest of all thinkers, literally couldn't see not only the sea slugs around them, but the lettuce on their plate -- because lettuces, and all those curly vegetables, they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry.
And so in some sense they literally, they had such a symbolic view of mathematics, they couldn't actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them.
It turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders.
And so, too, we've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures.
We started out, Chrissy and I and our contributors, doing the simple mathematically perfect models.
But we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three, increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code, the models immediately started to look more natural.
And all of our contributors, who are an amazing collection of people around the world, do their own embellishments.
As it were, we have this ever-evolving, crochet taxonomic tree of life.
Just as the morphology and the complexity of life on earth is never ending, little embellishments and complexifications in the DNA code lead to new things like giraffes, or orchids -- so too, do little embellishments in the crochet code lead to new and wondrous creatures in the evolutionary tree of crochet life.
So this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own.
There is the totality of all the people who have come to it.
And their individual visions, and their engagement with this mathematical mode.
We have these technologies. We use them.
But why? What's at stake here? What does it matter?
For Chrissy and I, one of the things that's important here is that these things suggest the importance and value of embodied knowledge.
We live in a society that completely tends to valorize symbolic forms of representation -- algebraic representations, equations, codes.
We live in a society that's obsessed with presenting information in this way, teaching information in this way.
But through this sort of modality, crochet, other plastic forms of play -- people can be engaged with the most abstract, high-powered, theoretical ideas, the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher mathematics, which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space.
But you can do it through playing with material objects.
One of the ways that we've come to think about this is that what we're trying to do with the Institute for Figuring and projects like this, we're trying to have kindergarten for grown-ups.
And kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education, established by a man named Friedrich Froebel, who was a crystallographer in the 19th century.
He believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation.
He developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play.
And he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right.
The value of education is something that Froebel championed, through plastic modes of play.
We live in a society now where we have lots of think tanks, where great minds go to think about the world.
They write these great symbolic treatises called books, and papers, and op-ed articles.
We want to propose, Chrissy and I, through The Institute for Figuring, another alternative way of doing things, which is the play tank.
And the play tank, like the think tank, is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas.
But what we want to propose, is that the highest levels of abstraction, things like mathematics, computing, logic, etc. -- all of this can be engaged with, not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods, but by literally, physically playing with ideas.
Thank you very much.

I work with a species called "Bonobo."
And I'm happy most of the time, because I think this is the happiest species on the planet.
It's kind of a well-kept secret.
This species lives only in the Congo.
And they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior.
Their sexual behavior is too human-like for most of us to be comfortable with.
But -- actually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside.
It permeates their entire life.
And it's used for communication.
And it's used for conflict resolution.
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of, divided our lives up into lots of parts.
We divided our world up with lots of categories.
And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.
But I don't think that we were that way initially.
There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired and that there's something very, very special about man.
Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought.
Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to have language.
Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.
Well, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire.
They had no stone tools.
To our knowledge they had no music.
So when you compare them to the Bonobo, the Bonobo is a little hairier.
He doesn't stand quite as upright.
But there are a lot of similarities.
And I think that as we look at culture, we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are.
And I don't really think it's in our biology; I think we've attributed it to our biology, but I don't really think it's there.
So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo.
This is Kanzi.
He's a Bonobo.
Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia.
His mother originally came from a forest in Africa.
And she came to us when she was just at puberty, about six or seven years of age.
Now this shows a Bonobo on your right, and a chimpanzee on your left.
Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.
The Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer, is more upright, just as we are.
This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.
As you can see, there's not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked.
As they turn toward us you'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side.
So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier.
And now we see all four.
The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle encircled by the Congo River.
Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet, grow densely in the area.
It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo, almost three decades ago.
Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.
Slim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.
Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them.
One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.
What's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances.
Susan Savage-Rumbaugh : Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame.
SS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest.
None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.
None of them are tricks.
They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously, by NHK of Japan.
We have eight Bonobos.
Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire.
SS: An entire family at our research centre.
You going to help get some sticks?
Good.
We need more sticks, too.
I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one.
That's a wasps' nest.
You can get it out.
I hope I have a lighter.
You can use the lighter to start the fire.
SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.
He doesn't do it yet without a lighter, but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do -- make a fire without a lighter.
He's learning about how to keep a fire going.
He's learning the uses for a fire, just by watching what we do with fire.
This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo.
These are happy vocalizations.
You're happy.
You're very happy about this part.
You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water?
Good job.
SS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack.
But he likes to carry things from place to place.
Austin, I hear you saying "Austin."
SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance, farther than we can hear.
This is his sister.
This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart.
Goodbye.
SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel.
She switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel, rather than turns it.
Like us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her.
By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human, and documenting their development across two decades, scientists are exploring how cultural forces may have operated during human evolution.
His name is Nyota.
It means "star" in Swahili.
Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors.
In the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring.
Here Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands, to groom Nyota.
Very impressive.
Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this.
Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself.
Realizing that Nyota might get hurt, Panbanisha, like any human mother, carefully tugs to get the scissors back.
He can now cut through tough animal hide.
SS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools.
Kanzi now makes his tools, just as our ancestors may have made them, two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other.
He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows, he can make much larger, sharper flakes.
Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.
The tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife.
The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle, requiring great skill.
Kanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago.
These are the rocks Kanzi used and these are the flakes he made.
The flat sharp edges are like knife blades.
Compare them to the tools our ancestors used; they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's.
Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods.
She keeps staring out the window.
SS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do.
For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside.
SS: I normally talk about language.
Then Panbanisha does something unexpected.
SS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do, I haven't told you that these apes have language.
It's a geometric language.
She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor.
What is she writing?
SS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice.
Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again.
SS: These are her symbols on her keyboard.
They speak when she touches them.
Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.
"A frame" represents a hut in the woods.
Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard.
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.
SS : Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha.
SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing, until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it.
This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar."
It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out.
SS: That's an institutional requirement.
This symbol is not as clear as the others, but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines.
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said, by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk.
Panbanisha watched.
Soon she began to write as well.
The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world.
How did they develop?
SS : We found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them.
It's simply to use language around them, because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.
Once you have that capacity, the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely.
So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos, like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting -- we want to create an environment in which they have fun, and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them.
This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha.
Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica, until Nyota, now one year old, steals it.
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.
Is he looking for where the sound came from?
Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.
This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano.
She wasn't forced to learn the piano; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest.
Researcher: Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening.
Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part.
Kanzi plays the xylophone; using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing.
Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment, which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.
Researcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them.
Take the cherries too.
Now watch out, stay away from them now.
Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them.
Now you have to stay away. Get away.
Run away. Run.
Now we can chase them again. Go get them.
Oh no!
Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much.
None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine?
SS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a "panhomoculture."
We're learning how to become like them.
We're learning how to communicate with them, in really high-pitched tones.
We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild.
And they're learning to become like us.
Because we believe that it's not biology; it's culture.
So we're sharing tools and technology and language with another species.
Thank you.

Namaste. Good morning.
I'm very happy to be here in India.
And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly 11 years with V-Day and "The Vagina Monologues," traveling the world, essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women.
What I want to talk about today is this particular cell, or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.
And I want to call it the girl cell.
And it's in men as well as in women.
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race.
And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell, the oppression of these cells, the reinterpretation of these cells, the undermining of these cells, getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing, eradicating, destroying, reducing these cells, basically began the process of killing off the girl cell, which was, by the way, patriarchy.
I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness.
And it is essential to balance, to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us.
And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion, and it's empathy, and it's passion itself, and it's vulnerability, and it's openness, and it's intensity, and it's association, and it's relationship, and it is intuitive.
And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom, and that vulnerability is our greatest strength, and that emotions have inherent logic, which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.
And then let's remember that we've been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be, that compassion clouds your thinking, that vulnerability is weakness, that emotions are not to be trusted, and you're not supposed to take things personally, which is one of my favorites.
I think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl.
How do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy?
To be a boy really means not to be a girl.
To be a man means not to be a girl.
To be a woman means not to be a girl.
To be strong means not to be a girl.
To be a leader means not to be a girl.
I actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we've had to train everyone not to be that.
And I'd also like to say that the irony of course, is that denying girl, suppressing girl, suppressing emotion, refusing feeling has lead thus here.
Where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence, the most horrific poverty, genocide, mass rapes, the destruction of the Earth, is completely out of control.
And because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our girl-ship, we do not feel what is going on.
So, we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening.
I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo.
For me, it was the turning point of my life.
I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years.
I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world, a lot of violence.
I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years.
But the Democratic Republic of Congo really was the turning point in my soul.
I went and I spent time in a place called Bukavu in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital, with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met.
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.
In the Congo, for those of you who don't know, there has been a war raging for the last 12 years, a war that has killed nearly six million people.
It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women have been raped there.
When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital I sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories.
Their stories were so horrific, and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence, that to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered.
And I will tell you that what happened is through that shattering, listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated, who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes, literally, inside them where their pee and poop came out of them.
Listening to the story of 80-year-old women who were tied to chains and circled, and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically, all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them.
My mind was so shattered.
But what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way I have never been emboldened.
That shattering, that opening of my girl cell, that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous, and braver, and actually more clever than I had been in the past in my life.
I want to say that I think the powers that be know that empire-building is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building.
Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth, and excavating the Earth, and destroying things.
I remember, for example, when my father, who was very, very violent, used to beat me.
And he would actually say, while he was beating me, "Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry."
Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him.
And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded of what he was doing.
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell.
And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women.
And I think in some ways we've been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell.
I see how boys have been brought up, and I see this across the planet: to be tough, to be hardened, to distance themselves from their tenderness, to not cry.
I actually realized once in Kosovo, when I watched a man break down, that bullets are actually hardened tears, that when we don't allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability, and have their compassion, and have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful and violent.
And I think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure, to pretend they know things when they don't know things, or why would we be where we are?
To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess.
And I will tell you a very funny story.
On my way here on the airplane, I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane.
And all these men, literally at least 10 men, were in their little seats watching chick flicks.
And they were all alone, and I thought, "This is the secret life of men."
I've traveled, as I said, to many, many countries, and I've seen, if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it's horrific to think what we do to girls in the world.
And we heard from Sunitha yesterday, and Kavita about what we do to girls.
But I just want to say that I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns, who are literally being treated like ashtrays.
I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans.
I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles.
I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves.
I've seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate, or we make them feel bad about being too smart.
We silence them. We make them feel guilty for being smart. We get them to behave, to tone it down, not to be too intense.
We sell them, we kill them as embryos, we enslave them, we rape them.
We are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities.
The selling of girls is rampant across the planet.
And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows.
But I also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 24, they are they key, really, in the developing world, as well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity.
And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be, including lack of access to healthcare, education, healthy foods, labor force participation.
The burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings, which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers.
The state of girls, the condition of girls, will, in my belief -- and that's the girl inside us and the girl in the world -- determine whether the species survives.
And what I want to suggest is that, having talked to girls, because I just finished a new book called "I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World," I've been talking to girls for five years, and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that's been enforced on girl is the verb "to please."
Girls are trained to please.
I want to change the verb.
I want us all to change the verb.
I want the verb to be "educate," or "activate," or "engage," or "confront," or "defy," or "create."
If we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them.
And I have to now share a few stories of girls I've seen across the planet who have engaged their girl, who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them.
I know a 14-year-old girl in the Netherlands, for example, who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself.
There is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed 56 stars tattooed on the right side of her face.
There is a girl, Julia Butterfly Hill, who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks.
There is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan who I have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary.
And this girl, when she was 17 years old, wore a burqa in Afghanistan, and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women, underneath her burqa, with a video.
And that video became the video that went out all over the world after 9/11 to show what was going on in Afghanistan.
I want to talk about Rachel Corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank to say, "End the occupation."
And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank.
And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently in Bukavu, who was impregnated by her rapist.
And she was holding her baby.
And I asked her if she loved her baby.
And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said, "Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby?
It's my baby and it's full of love."
The capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels, to me, is mind-blowing.
There is a girl named Dorcas, and I just met her in Kenya.
Dorcas is 15 years old, and she was trained in self-defense.
A few months ago she was picked up on the street by three older men.
They kidnapped her, they put her in a car.
And through her self-defense, she grabbed their Adam's apples, she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car.
In Kenya, in August, I went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls, a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio.
Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl, she was female genitally mutilated.
And she made a decision as many women do across this planet, that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls.
So, for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley.
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like, and what a mutilated vagina looked like.
And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her we asked her what we could do for her, and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster."
So, we got her a Jeep. And then she saved 4,500 girls.
And then we asked her, "Okay, what else do you need?"
And she said, "Well, now, I need a house."
So, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house in Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land.
And it was a house where girls could run away, they could save their clitoris, they wouldn't be cut, they could go to school.
And in the years that Agnes has had the house, she has changed the situation there.
She has literally become deputy mayor.
She's changed the rules.
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing.
When we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls, who have run away, with their families.
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn.
Jaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family and there's a drought in Kenya.
So cows are dying, and cows are the most valued possession.
And Jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the cows.
And she knew that meant she would be cut.
She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school.
She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future.
She knew she would have to marry that old man, and she was 14.
So, one afternoon, she'd heard about the safe house, Jaclyn left her father's house and she walked for two days, two days through Masai land.
She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night.
She imagined her father killing her on one hand, and Mama Agnes greeting her, with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house.
And when she got to the house she was greeted.
Agnes took her in, and Agnes loved her, and Agnes supported her for the year.
She went to school and she found her voice, and she found her identity, and she found her heart.
Then, her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation, after a year.
I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled.
In that hut, we walked in, and her father and his four wives were sitting there, and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled, and her primary mother, who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders.
When her father saw her and saw who she had become, in her full girl self, he threw his arms around her and broke down crying.
He said, "You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman.
We will not cut you.
And I give you my word, here and now, that we will not cut your sisters either."
And what she said to him was, "You were willing to sell me for four cows, and a calf and some blankets.
But I promise you, now that I will be educated I will always take care of you, and I will come back and I will build you a house.
And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life."
For me, that is the power of girls.
And that is the power of transformation.
I want to close today with a new piece from my book.
And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here.
And I want to do it for Sunitha.
And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday, the girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.
But I really want to do it for each and every person here, to value the girl in us, to value the part that cries, to value the part that's emotional, to value the part that's vulnerable, to understand that's where the future lies.
This is called "I'm An Emotional Creature."
And it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A.
I was asking girls if they like being a girl, and all the girls were like, "No, I hate it. I can't stand it.
It's all bad. My brothers get everything."
And this girl just sat up and went, "I love being a girl.
I'm an emotional creature!"
This is for her: I love being a girl.
I can feel what you're feeling as you're feeling inside the feeling before.
I am an emotional creature.
Things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard-pressed ideas.
They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears.
Oh, I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off, even though she appears to give you what you want.
I know when a storm is coming.
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air.
I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share.
I am an emotional creature.
I love that I do not take things lightly.
Everything is intense to me, the way I walk in the street, the way my momma wakes me up, the way it's unbearable when I lose, the way I hear bad news.
I am an emotional creature.
I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that.
Don't you say all negative that it's only only a teenage thing, or it's only because I'm a girl.
These feelings make me better.
They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong.
I am an emotional creature.
There is a particular way of knowing.
It's like the older women somehow forgot.
I rejoice that it's still in my body.
Oh, I know when the coconut's about to fall.
I know we have pushed the Earth too far.
I know my father isn't coming back, and that no one's prepared for the fire.
I know that lipstick means more than show, and boys are super insecure, and so-called terrorists are made, not born.
I know that one kiss could take away all my decision-making ability.
And you know what? Sometimes it should.
This is not extreme. It's a girl thing, what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open.
Don't tell me not to cry, to calm it down, not to be so extreme, to be reasonable.
I am an emotional creature.
It's how the earth got made, how the wind continues to pollinate.
You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave.
I am an emotional creature.
Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off?
I am your remaining memory.
I can take you back.
Nothing's been diluted.
Nothing's leaked out.
I love, hear me, I love that I can feel the feelings inside you, even if they stop my life, even if they break my heart, even if they take me off track, they make me responsible.
I am an emotional, I am an emotional, incondotional, devotional creature.
And I love, hear me, I love, love, love being a girl.
Can you say it with me?
I love, I love, love, love being a girl!
Thank you very much.

<title>Eve Ensler: Embrace your inner girl</title>
<description>In this passionate talk, Eve Ensler declares that there is a girl cell in us all -- a cell that we have all been taught to suppress. She tells heartfelt stories of girls around the world who have overcome shocking adversity and violence to reveal the astonishing strength of being a girl.</description>
<keywords>culture,gender,self,social change,women</keywords>

So for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky.
We don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in, where career choices for women were so limited.
And if you're in this room today, most of us grew up in a world where we had basic civil rights, and amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them.
But all that aside, we still have a problem, and it's a real problem.
And the problem is this: Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world.
The numbers tell the story quite clearly.
190 heads of state -- nine are women.
Of all the people in parliament in the world, 13 percent are women.
In the corporate sector, women at the top, C-level jobs, board seats -- tops out at 15, 16 percent.
The numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction.
And even in the non-profit world, a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women, women at the top: 20 percent.
We also have another problem, which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment.
A recent study in the U.S.
showed that, of married senior managers, two-thirds of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children.
A couple of years ago, I was in New York, and I was pitching a deal, and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture.
And I'm in the meeting -- it's about a three-hour meeting -- and two hours in, there kind of needs to be that bio break, and everyone stands up, and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed.
And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office.
So I start looking around for moving boxes, figuring they just moved in, but I don't see any.
And so I said, "Did you just move into this office?"
And he said, "No, we've been here about a year."
And I said, "Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year?"
And he looked at me, and he said, "Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom."
So the question is, how are we going to fix this?
How do we change these numbers at the top?
How do we make this different?
I want to start out by saying, I talk about this -- about keeping women in the workforce -- because I really think that's the answer.
In the high-income part of our workforce, in the people who end up at the top -- Fortune 500 CEO jobs, or the equivalent in other industries -- the problem, I am convinced, is that women are dropping out.
Now people talk about this a lot, and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women.
I want to talk about none of that today, even though that's all really important.
Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals.
What are the messages we need to tell ourselves?
What are the messages we tell the women who work with and for us?
What are the messages we tell our daughters?
Now, at the outset, I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments.
I don't have the right answer.
I don't even have it for myself.
I left San Francisco, where I live, on Monday, and I was getting on the plane for this conference.
And my daughter, who's three, when I dropped her off at preschool, did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying, "Mommy, don't get on the plane" thing.
This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes.
I know no women, whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce, who don't feel that sometimes.
So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone.
My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce, and I think there are three.
One, sit at the table.
Two, make your partner a real partner.
And three, don't leave before you leave.
Number one: sit at the table.
Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook, we hosted a very senior government official, and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley.
And everyone kind of sat at the table.
And then he had these two women who were traveling with him who were pretty senior in his department, and I kind of said to them, "Sit at the table. Come on, sit at the table," and they sat on the side of the room.
When I was in college my senior year, I took a course called European Intellectual History.
Don't you love that kind of thing from college?
I wish I could do that now.
And I took it with my roommate, Carrie, who was then a brilliant literary student -- and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar -- and my brother -- smart guy, but a water-polo-playing pre-med, who was a sophomore.
The three of us take this class together.
And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin, goes to all the lectures.
I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures.
My brother is kind of busy.
He reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures, marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored.
The three of us go to the exam together, and we sit down.
And we sit there for three hours -- and our little blue notebooks -- yes, I'm that old.
And we walk out, and we look at each other, and we say, "How did you do?"
And Carrie says, "Boy, I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic."
And I say, "God, I really wish I had really connected John Locke's theory of property with the philosophers who follow."
And my brother says, "I got the top grade in the class."
"You got the top grade in the class?
You don't know anything."
The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows: women systematically underestimate their own abilities.
If you test men and women, and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs, men get it wrong slightly high, and women get it wrong slightly low.
Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce.
A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57 percent of boys entering, or men, I guess, are negotiating their first salary, and only seven percent of women.
And most importantly, men attribute their success to themselves, and women attribute it to other external factors.
If you ask men why they did a good job, they'll say, "I'm awesome.
Obviously. Why are you even asking?"
If you ask women why they did a good job, what they'll say is someone helped them, they got lucky, they worked really hard.
Why does this matter?
Boy, it matters a lot because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side, not at the table, and no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success, or they don't even understand their own success.
I wish the answer were easy.
I wish I could just go tell all the young women I work for, all these fabulous women, "Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself.
Own your own success."
I wish I could tell that to my daughter.
But it's not that simple.
Because what the data shows, above all else, is one thing, which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women.
And everyone's nodding, because we all know this to be true.
There's a really good study that shows this really well.
There's a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen.
And she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley, and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist.
In 2002 -- not so long ago -- a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it Howard Roizen.
And he gave the case out, both of them, to two groups of students.
He changed exactly one word: "Heidi" to "Howard."
But that one word made a really big difference.
He then surveyed the students, and the good news was the students, both men and women, thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent, and that's good.
The bad news was that everyone liked Howard.
He's a great guy. You want to work for him.
You want to spend the day fishing with him.
But Heidi? Not so sure.
She's a little out for herself. She's a little political.
You're not sure you'd want to work for her.
This is the complication.
We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues, we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A, to reach for the promotion, to sit at the table, and we have to do it in a world where, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that, even though for their brothers, there are not.
The saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this.
And I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me, but I think important.
I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees, and a couple hours later, there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk, and she wanted to talk to me.
I said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked.
And she said, "I learned something today.
I learned that I need to keep my hand up."
I said, "What do you mean?"
She said, "Well, you're giving this talk, and you said you were going to take two more questions.
And I had my hand up with lots of other people, and you took two more questions.
And I put my hand down, and I noticed all the women put their hand down, and then you took more questions, only from the men."
And I thought to myself, wow, if it's me -- who cares about this, obviously -- giving this talk -- and during this talk, I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised, and the women's hands are still raised, how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women?
We've got to get women to sit at the table.
Message number two: make your partner a real partner.
I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home.
The data shows this very clearly.
If a woman and a man work full-time and have a child, the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does, and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does.
So she's got three jobs or two jobs, and he's got one.
Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more?
The causes of this are really complicated, and I don't have time to go into them.
And I don't think Sunday football-watching and general laziness is the cause.
I think the cause is more complicated.
I think, as a society, we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls.
I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers, and it's hard.
When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff and I see the father there, I notice that the other mommies don't play with him.
And that's a problem, because we have to make it as important a job, because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home, for people of both genders, if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce.
Studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate.
And if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there, they also have more -- how shall I say this on this stage? -- they know each other more in the biblical sense as well.
Message number three: don't leave before you leave.
I think there's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking -- and I see this all the time -- with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving.
Here's what happens: We're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy.
And she starts thinking about having a child, and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child, she starts thinking about making room for that child.
"How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing?"
And literally from that moment, she doesn't raise her hand anymore, she doesn't look for a promotion, she doesn't take on the new project, she doesn't say, "Me. I want to do that."
She starts leaning back.
The problem is that -- let's say she got pregnant that day, that day -- nine months of pregnancy, three months of maternity leave, six months to catch your breath -- fast-forward two years, more often -- and as I've seen it -- women start thinking about this way earlier -- when they get engaged, when they get married, when they start thinking about trying to have a child, which can take a long time.
One woman came to see me about this, and I kind of looked at her -- she looked a little young.
And I said, "So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby?"
And she said, "Oh no, I'm not married."
She didn't even have a boyfriend.
I said, "You're thinking about this just way too early."
But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back?
Everyone who's been through this -- and I'm here to tell you, once you have a child at home, your job better be really good to go back, because it's hard to leave that kid at home -- your job needs to be challenging.
It needs to be rewarding.
You need to feel like you're making a difference.
And if two years ago you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you did, if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities, you're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal.
Don't leave before you leave.
Stay in.
Keep your foot on the gas pedal, until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child -- and then make your decisions.
Don't make decisions too far in advance, particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making.
My generation really, sadly, is not going to change the numbers at the top.
They're just not moving.
We are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population -- in my generation, there will not be 50 percent of [women] at the top of any industry.
But I'm hopeful that future generations can.
I think a world that was run where half of our countries and half of our companies were run by women, would be a better world.
And it's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are, even though that would be very helpful.
I think it would be a better world.
I have two children.
I have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter.
I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home, and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments.
Thank you.

<keywords>business,education,leadership,technology,women</keywords>

Today, I'm going to take you around the world in 18 minutes.
My base of operations is in the U.S., but let's start at the other end of the map, in Kyoto, Japan, where I was living with a Japanese family while I was doing part of my dissertational research 15 years ago.
I knew even then that I would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings, but they popped up when I least expected it.
On my first day, I went to a restaurant, and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar.
After a pause, the waiter said, "One does not put sugar in green tea."
"I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom.
But I really like my tea sweet."
In response, he gave me an even more courteous version of the same explanation.
"One does not put sugar in green tea."
"I understand," I said, "that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea, but I'd like to put some sugar in my green tea."
Surprised by my insistence, the waiter took up the issue with the manager.
Pretty soon, a lengthy discussion ensued, and finally the manager came over to me and said, "I am very sorry. We do not have sugar."
Well, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it, I ordered a cup of coffee, which the waiter brought over promptly.
Resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar.
My failure to procure myself a cup of sweet, green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding.
This was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice.
From my American perspective, when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences, she has every right to have that request met.
The American way, to quote Burger King, is to "have it your way," because, as Starbucks says, "happiness is in your choices."
But from the Japanese perspective, it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better -- in this case, the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice.
Let's face it: the way I wanted my tea was inappropriate according to cultural standards, and they were doing their best to help me save face.
Americans tend to believe that they've reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice.
They think that choice, as seen through the American lens best fulfills an innate and universal desire for choice in all humans.
Unfortunately, these beliefs are based on assumptions that don't always hold true in many countries, in many cultures.
At times they don't even hold true at America's own borders.
I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them.
As I do so, I hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds.
First assumption: if a choice affects you, then you should be the one to make it.
This is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for.
It is essential for success.
In America, the primary locus of choice is the individual.
People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns, regardless of what other people want or recommend.
It's called "being true to yourself."
But do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice?
Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question.
In one study, which we ran in Japantown, San Francisco, we brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children into the laboratory, and we divided them up into three groups.
The first group came in, and they were greeted by Miss Smith, who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do, and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with.
When the second group of children came in, they were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams, but this time Miss Smith told them which anagrams to do and which markers to write their answers with.
Now when the third group came in, they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers.
In reality, the kids who were told what to do, whether by Miss Smith or their mothers, were actually given the very same activity, which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen.
With this procedure, we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity, making it easier for us to compare performance.
Such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed.
Anglo-Americans, they did two and a half times more anagrams when they got to choose them, as compared to when it was chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers.
It didn't matter who did the choosing, if the task was dictated by another, their performance suffered.
In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted.
One girl named Mary said, "You asked my mother?"
In contrast, Asian-American children performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice, second best when they chose for themselves, and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith.
A girl named Natsumi even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room and tugged on her skirt and asked, "Could you please tell my mommy I did it just like she said?"
The first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice.
For them, choice was not just a way of defining and asserting their individuality, but a way to create community and harmony by deferring to the choices of people whom they trusted and respected.
If they had a concept of being true to one's self, then that self, most likely, [was] composed, not of an individual, but of a collective.
Success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one's own preferences.
Or, you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others.
The assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others.
When, in contrast, two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected, then they may amplify one another's success by turning choosing into a collective act.
To insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships.
Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands.
It leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.
It requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act.
People that have grown up in such a paradigm might find it motivating, but it is a mistake to assume that everyone thrives under the pressure of choosing alone.
The second assumption which informs the American view of choice goes something like this.
The more choices you have, the more likely you are to make the best choice.
So bring it on, Walmart, with 100,000 different products, and Amazon, with 27 million books and Match.com with -- what is it? -- 15 million date possibilities now.
You will surely find the perfect match.
Let's test this assumption by heading over to Eastern Europe.
Here, I interviewed people who were residents of formerly communist countries, who had all faced the challenge of transitioning to a more democratic and capitalistic society.
One of the most interesting revelations came not from an answer to a question, but from a simple gesture of hospitality.
When the participants arrived for their interview, I offered them a set of drinks: Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite -- seven, to be exact.
During the very first session, which was run in Russia, one of the participants made a comment that really caught me off guard.
"Oh, but it doesn't matter.
It's all just soda. That's just one choice."
I was so struck by this comment that from then on, I started to offer all the participants those seven sodas, and I asked them, "How many choices are these?"
Again and again, they perceived these seven different sodas, not as seven choices, but as one choice: soda or no soda.
When I put out juice and water in addition to these seven sodas, now they perceived it as only three choices -- juice, water and soda.
Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans, not just to a particular flavor of soda, but to a particular brand.
You know, research shows repeatedly that we can't actually tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi.
Of course, you and I know that Coke is the better choice.
For modern Americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world, choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is.
Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better, and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters and so every choice matters.
But for Eastern Europeans, the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge.
They were flooded with choice before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim.
When asked, "What words and images do you associate with choice?"
Grzegorz from Warsaw said, "Ah, for me it is fear.
There are some dilemmas you see.
I am used to no choice."
Bohdan from Kiev said, in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace, "It is too much.
We do not need everything that is there."
A sociologist from the Warsaw Survey Agency explained, "The older generation jumped from nothing to choice all around them.
They were never given a chance to learn how to react."
And Tomasz, a young Polish man said, "I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum.
I don't mean to say that I want no choice, but many of these choices are quite artificial."
In reality, many choices are between things that are not that much different.
The value of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the options.
Americans train their whole lives to play "spot the difference."
They practice this from such an early age that they've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability.
In fact, though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice, we don't all see choice in the same places or to the same extent.
When someone can't see how one choice is unlike another, or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast, the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating.
Instead of making better choices, we become overwhelmed by choice, sometimes even afraid of it.
Choice no longer offers opportunities, but imposes constraints.
It's not a marker of liberation, but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae.
In other words, choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in America when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it.
But it is not only other people in other places that are feeling the pressure of ever-increasing choice.
Americans themselves are discovering that unlimited choice seems more attractive in theory than in practice.
We all have physical, mental and emotional limitations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter, even in the grocery store, let alone over the course of our entire lives.
A number of my studies have shown that when you give people 10 or more options when they're making a choice, they make poorer decisions, whether it be health care, investment, other critical areas.
Yet still, many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them.
This brings me to the third, and perhaps most problematic, assumption: "You must never say no to choice."
To examine this, let's go back to the U.S.
and then hop across the pond to France.
Right outside Chicago, a young couple, Susan and Daniel Mitchell, were about to have their first baby.
They'd already picked out a name for her, Barbara, after her grandmother.
One night, when Susan was seven months pregnant, she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room.
The baby was delivered through a C-section, but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia, a loss of oxygen to the brain.
Unable to breathe on her own, she was put on a ventilator.
Two days later, the doctors gave the Mitchells a choice: They could either remove Barbara off the life support, in which case she would die within a matter of hours, or they could keep her on life support, in which case she might still die within a matter of days.
If she survived, she would remain in a permanent vegetative state, never able to walk, talk or interact with others.
What do they do?
What do any parent do?
In a study I conducted with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali, American and French parents were interviewed.
They had all suffered the same tragedy.
In all cases, the life support was removed, and the infants had died.
But there was a big difference.
In France, the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed, while in the United States, the final decision rested with the parents.
We wondered: does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one?
We found that it did.
Even up to a year later, American parents were more likely to express negative emotions, as compared to their French counterparts.
French parents were more likely to say things like, "Noah was here for so little time, but he taught us so much.
He gave us a new perspective on life."
American parents were more likely to say things like, "What if? What if?"
Another parent complained, "I feel as if they purposefully tortured me.
How did they get me to do that?"
And another parent said, "I feel as if I've played a role in an execution."
But when the American parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision, they all said, "No."
They could not imagine turning that choice over to another, even though having made that choice made them feel trapped, guilty, angry.
In a number of cases they were even clinically depressed.
These parents could not contemplate giving up the choice, because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught and everything they had come to believe about the power and purpose of choice.
In her essay, "The White Album," Joan Didion writes, "We tell ourselves stories in order to live.
We interpret what we see, select the most workable of the multiple choices.
We live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images, by the idea with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria, which is our actual experience."
The story Americans tell, the story upon which the American dream depends, is the story of limitless choice.
This narrative promises so much: freedom, happiness, success.
It lays the world at your feet and says, "You can have anything, everything."
It's a great story, and it's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it.
But when you take a close look, you start to see the holes, and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways.
Americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice, believing that they will be, or ought to be, welcomed with open hearts and minds.
But the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn't always work out that way.
The phantasmagoria, the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative, varies from place to place.
No single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere.
Moreover, Americans themselves could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative, which has been driving their choices for so long.
Robert Frost once said that, "It is poetry that is lost in translation."
This suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving, whatever gives us a new way to see, cannot be communicated to those who speak a different language.
But Joseph Brodsky said that, "It is poetry that is gained in translation," suggesting that translation can be a creative, transformative act.
When it comes to choice, we have far more to gain than to lose by engaging in the many translations of the narratives.
Instead of replacing one story with another, we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written.
No matter where we're from and what your narrative is, we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do, and what it can represent.
And this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism.
Rather, it teaches us when and how to act.
It brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice, to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn't always deliver.
If we learn to speak to one another, albeit through translation, then we can begin to see choice in all its strangeness, complexity and compelling beauty.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sheena, there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book.
But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind.
And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is: How does that influence your study of choosing because that's an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on?
Sheena Iyengar: Well, it's funny that you should ask that because one of the things that's interesting about being blind is you actually get a different vantage point when you observe the way sighted people make choices.
And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days.
Yeah, I -- as you would expect -- get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because I have to rely on what other people suggest.
And I can't decide.
And so one time I was in a beauty salon, and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink.
And one was called "Ballet Slippers."
And the other one was called "Adorable."
And so I asked these two ladies, and the one lady told me, "Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'" "Well, what does it look like?"
"Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink."
"Okay, great."
The other lady tells me to wear "Adorable."
"What does it look like?"
"It's a glamorous shade of pink."
And so I asked them, "Well, how do I tell them apart?
What's different about them?"
And they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous."
Okay, we got that.
And the only thing they had consensus on: well, if I could see them, I would clearly be able to tell them apart.
And what I wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color, so I decided to do a little experiment.
So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory, and I stripped the labels off.
And I brought women into the laboratory, and I asked them, "Which one would you pick?"
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick, of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles.
At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on.
Now, of the women that could tell them apart, when the labels were off, they picked "Adorable," and when the labels were on, they picked "Ballet Slippers."
So as far as I can tell, a rose by any other name probably does look different and maybe even smells different.
Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena.

I'd like to share with you the story of one of my patients called Celine.
Celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of Cameroon in west Central Africa.
Six years ago, at the time of her HIV diagnosis, she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time.
When I first met Celine, a little over a year ago, she had gone for 18 months without any antiretroviral therapy, and she was very ill.
She told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended because she had no money for the bus fare and was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance.
Now during the clinical trial, she'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge, and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds.
All of these ended once the trial was completed, leaving Celine with no alternatives.
She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she'd received during the trial, or even what the trial had been about.
I didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue.
Yet what puzzled me most was Celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial, yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed.
Now, I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted.
Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results.
Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal.
Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients.
But it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who, like Celine, were left to their own devices once the research had been completed.
I do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting HIV clinical trials in developing countries is bad.
On the contrary, clinical trials are extremely useful tools, and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries.
However, the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation, especially in the context of externally-funded research.
Sadly enough, the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research.
I'm sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, so attractive for these HIV clinical trials?
Well, in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results, they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new HIV infections.
Sub-Saharan Africa largely fits this description, with 22 million people living with HIV, an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected worldwide.
Also, research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty, endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems.
A clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population is more likely to be authorized, and in the absence of good health care systems, almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing.
Even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation, less rigorous ethical reviews, and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure.
As funding for HIV research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict, you can see why this context becomes very, very attractive.
The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels ethically questionable.
How then can we ensure that, in our search for the cure, we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic?
I invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on in order to improve the way in which things are done.
The first of these is informed consent.
Now, in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable, participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand, and must freely consent to participate in the trial.
This is especially important in developing countries, where a lot of participants consent to research because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits.
Consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries.
For example, it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant, like Celine, sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read, let alone understand.
Local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials, as well as the incentives for participation.
The information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats.
The second point I would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial.
Now, this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy.
Should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available anywhere in the world?
Or should they be given an alternative standard of care, such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted?
Is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed?
Now, in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver, the answer is straightforward.
However, the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries.
It is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial, and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study.
That brings us to the third point I want you think about: the ethical review of research.
An effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial.
Unfortunately, this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries.
Local governments need to set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries, and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government and research sponsors.
Public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate.
The final point I would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed.
I think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended.
Now, researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed.
In addition, they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends.
If, for any reason, they feel that this might not be possible, then I think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place.
Now, fortunately for Celine, our meeting did not end in my office.
I was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program closer to her home, and with a support group to help her cope.
Her story has a positive ending, but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate.
Although she may not know this, my encounter with Celine has completely changed the way in which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries, and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done.
I believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change.
If you are a researcher, I hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience, to remain ethical in your research, and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers.
If you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company, I challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound.
If you come from a developing country like myself, I urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country.
Yes, there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV, to find an effective vaccine for malaria, to find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B., but I believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way.
Thank you.

I want to talk about penguins today.
But first, I want to start by saying that we need a new operating system, for the oceans and for the Earth.
When I came to the Galapagos 40 years ago, there were 3,000 people that lived in the Galapagos.
Now there are over 30,000.
There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz.
Now, there are around a thousand trucks and buses and cars there.
So the fundamental problems that we face are overconsumption and too many people.
It's the same problems in the Galapagos, except, obviously, it's worse here, in some ways, than other places.
Because we've only doubled the population of the Earth since the 1960s -- a little more than doubled -- but we have 6.7 billion people in the world, and we all like to consume.
And one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the proper feedback.
We're not paying the true environmental costs of our actions.
And when I came at age 22 to live on Fernandina, let me just say, that I had never camped before.
I had never lived alone for any period of time, and I'd never slept with sea lions snoring next to me all night.
But moreover, I'd never lived on an uninhabited island.
Punta Espinosa is where I lived for over a year, and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there.
But it's alive with life; it's hardly uninhabited.
So a lot has happened in the last 40 years, and what I learned when I came to the Galapagos is the importance of wild places, wild things, certainly wildlife, and the amazing qualities that penguins have.
Penguins are real athletes: They can swim 173 kilometers in a day.
They can swim at the same speed day and night -- that's faster than any Olympic swimmer.
I mean, they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it.
But what is really amazing, because of this deepness here, Emperor penguins can go down more than 500 meters and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes.
Magellanic penguins, the ones that I work on, they can dive to about 90 meters and they can stay down for about 4.6 minutes.
Humans, without fins: 90 meters, 3.5 minutes.
And I doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes.
You have to train to be able to do that.
So penguins are amazing athletes.
The other thing is, I've never met anybody that really doesn't say that they like penguins.
They're comical, they walk upright, and, of course, they're diligent.
And, more importantly, they're well-dressed.
So they have all the criteria that people normally like.
But scientifically, they're amazing because they're sentinels.
They tell us about our world in a lot of different ways, and particularly the ocean.
This is a picture of a Galapagos penguin that's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos.
And that's what I came to study.
I thought I was going to study the social behavior of Galapagos penguins, but you already know penguins are rare.
These are the rarest penguins in the world.
Why I thought I was going to be able to do that, I don't know.
But the population has changed dramatically since I was first here.
When I counted penguins for the first time and tried to do a census, we just counted all the individual beaks that we could around all these islands.
We counted around 2,000, so I don't know how many penguins there really are, but I know I can count 2,000.
If you go and do it now, the national parks count about 500.
So we have a quarter of the penguins that we did 40 years ago.
And this is true of most of our living systems.
We have less than we had before, and most of them are in fairly steep decline.
And I want to just show you a little bit about why.
That's a penguin braying to tell you that it's important to pay attention to penguins.
Most important of all, I didn't know what that was the first time I heard it.
And you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there and you hear this lonesome, plaintful call.
I fell in love with penguins, and it certainly has changed the rest of my life.
What I found out I was studying is really the difference in how the Galapagos changes, the most extreme variation.
You've heard about these El Ninos, but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world have to adapt to.
This is a cold-water event called La Nina.
Where it's blue and it's green, it means the water is really cold.
And so you can see this current coming up -- in this case, the Humboldt Current -- that comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands, and this deep undersea current, the Cromwell Current, that upwells around the Galapagos.
That brings all the nutrients: When this is cold in the Galapagos, it's rich, and there's plenty of food for everyone.
When we have extreme El Nino events, you see all this red, and you see no green out here around the Galapagos.
That means that there's no upwelling, and there's basically no food.
So it's a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ...
things die when there's no food.
But we didn't even know that that affected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins.
And you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins, and you're in the middle of an El Nino event and there are no penguins.
They're not breeding; they're not even around.
I studied marine iguanas at that point.
But this is a global phenomenon, we know that.
And if you look along the coast of Argentina, where I work now, at a place called Punta Tombo -- the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude -- you see that there's great variation here.
Some years, the cold water goes all the way up to Brazil, and other years, in these La Nina years, it doesn't.
So the oceans don't always act together; they act differently, but that is the kind of variation that penguins have to live with, and it's not easy.
So when I went to study the Magellanic penguins, I didn't have any problems.
There were plenty of them.
This is a picture at Punta Tombo in February showing all the penguins along the beach.
I went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them and turning them into high fashion golf gloves, protein and oil.
Fortunately, nobody has harvested any penguins and we're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them.
But the population is declining and it's declined fairly substantially, about 21 percent since 1987, when I started these surveys, in terms of number of active nests.
Here, you can see where Punta Tombo is, and they breed in incredibly dense colonies.
We know this because of long-term science, because we have long-term studies there.
And science is important in informing decision makers, and also in changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we're going in.
And so we have this penguin project. The Wildlife Conservation Society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last 27 years to be able to produce these kinds of maps.
And also, we know that it's not only Galapagos penguins that are in trouble, but Magellanics and many other species of penguins.
And so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins.
This is one of the plights of penguins: oil pollution.
Penguins don't like oil and they don't like to swim through oil.
The nice thing is, if you look down here in Argentina, there's no surface oil pollution from this composite map.
But, in fact, when we went to Argentina, penguins were often found totally covered in oil.
So they were just minding their own business.
They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it.
Because when tankers carry oil they have to have ballast at some point, so when they're empty, they have the ballast water in there.
When they come back, they actually dump this oily ballast water into the ocean.
Why do they do that? Because it's cheaper, because they don't pay the real environmental costs.
We usually don't, and we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost.
At first, the Argentine government said, "No, there's no way.
You can't find oiled penguins in Argentina.
We have laws, and we can't have illegal dumping; it's against the law."
So we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins.
In some years, like this year, we found more than 80 percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil.
These little blue dots are the fledglings -- we do this survey every March -- which means that they're only in the environment from January until March, so maybe three months at the most that they could get covered in oil.
And you can see, in some years over 60 percent of the fledglings were oiled.
Eventually, the government listened and, amazingly, they changed their laws.
They moved the tanker lanes 40 kilometers farther off shore, and people are not doing as much illegal dumping.
So what we're seeing now is very few penguins are oiled.
Why are there even these penguins oiled?
Because we've solved the problem in Chubut province, which is like a state in Argentina where Punta Tombo is -- so that's about 1,000 kilometers of coastline -- but we haven't solved the problem in northern Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.
So now I want to show you that penguins are affected.
I'm just going to talk about two things.
This is climate change. Now this has really been a fun study because I put satellite tags on the back of these Magellanic penguins.
Try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins.
But we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go.
We thought we needed a marine protected area of about 30 kilometers, and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin.
And what the penguins show us -- and these are all the little dots from where the penguins' positions were for penguins in incubation in 2003 -- and what you see is some of these individuals are going 800 kilometers away from their nests.
So that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs, the other one is out there foraging, and the longer they have to stay gone, the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back.
And, of course, all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can't raise a lot of chicks.
Here you see in 2003 -- these are all the dots of where the penguins are -- they were raising a little over a half of a chick.
Here, you can see in 2006, they raised almost three quarters of a chick per nest, and you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo; they're not going as far away.
This past year, in 2009, you can see that they're now raising about a fourth of a chick, and some of these individuals are going more than 900 kilometers away from their nests.
So it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago, and then you get transferred to St. Louis, and your mate is not happy about this because you've got to pay airfare, because you're gone longer.
The same thing's true for penguins as well.
And they're going about, on average now, 40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago.
We need to be able to get information out to the general public.
And so we started a publication with the Society for Conservation that we think presents cutting-edge science in a new, novel way, because we have reporters that are good writers that actually can distill the information and make it accessible to the general public.
So if you're interested in cutting-edge science and smarter conservation, you should join with our 11 partners -- some of them here in this room, like the Nature Conservancy -- and look at this magazine because we need to get information out about conservation to the general public.
Lastly I want to say that all of you, probably, have had some relationship at some time in your life with a dog, a cat, some sort of pet, and you recognized that those are individuals.
And some of you consider them almost part of your family.
If you had a relationship with a penguin, you'd see it in the same sort of way.
They're amazing creatures that really change how you view the world because they're not that different from us: They're trying to make a living, they're trying to raise their offspring, they're trying to get on and survive in the world.
This is Turbo the Penguin.
Turbo's never been fed.
He met us and got his name because he started standing under my diesel truck: a turbo truck, so we named him Turbo.
Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak, we let him in and he comes in here.
And I just wanted to show you what happened one day when Turbo brought in a friend.
So this is Turbo.
He's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting, which he would do to a female penguin.
And you can see, he's not trying to bite.
This guy has never been in before and he's trying to figure out, "What is going on?
What is this guy doing?
This is really pretty weird."
And you'll see soon that my graduate student ...
and you see, Turbo's pretty intent on his flipper patting.
And now he's looking at the other guy, saying, "You are really weird."
And now look at this: not friendly.
So penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats.
We're also trying to collect our information and become more technologically literate.
So we're trying to put that in computers in the field.
And penguins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another.
This is a radio frequency ID system.
You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode, so it tells you who it is.
It walks over the pad, and you know who it is.
Okay, so here are a few penguins coming in.
See, this one's coming back to its nest.
They're all coming in at this time, walking across there, just kind of leisurely coming in.
Here's a female that's in a hurry. She's got food.
She's really rushing back, because it's hot, to try to feed her chicks.
And then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by.
Look how fat he is. He's walking back to feed his chicks.
Then I realize that they're playing king of the box.
This is my box up here, and this is the system that works.
You can see this penguin, he goes over, he looks at those wires, does not like that wire.
He unplugs the wire; we have no data.
So, they really are pretty amazing creatures.
OK.
Most important thing is: Only you can change yourself, and only you can change the world and make it better, for people as well as penguins.

Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging?
This is a dream of the ages.
But scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible.
They thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old shoe.
But if you look in nature, you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans.
Now these animals are different from one another, because they have different genes.
So that suggests that somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA, are genes for aging, genes that allow them to have different lifespans.
So if there are genes like that, then you can imagine that, if you could change one of the genes in an experiment, an aging gene, maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan.
And if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging.
And if they exist and you can find them, then maybe one could eventually do something about it.
So we've set out to look for genes that control aging.
And we didn't study any of these animals.
Instead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans, which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence.
And we were really optimistic that we could find something because there had been a report of a long-lived mutant.
So we started to change genes at random, looking for long-lived animals.
And we were very lucky to find that mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2 doubled the lifespan of the little worm.
So you can see in black, after a month -- they're very short-lived; that's why we like to study them for studies of aging -- in black, after a month, the normal worms are all dead.
But at that time, most of the mutant worms are still alive.
And it isn't until twice as long that they're all dead.
And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.
So the first thing you're going to see is the normal worm when it's about college student age -- a young adult.
It's quite a cute little fellow.
And next you're going to see the long-lived mutant when it's young.
So this animal is going to live twice as long.
Is it miserable? It doesn't seem to be.
It's active. You can't tell the difference really.
And they can be completely fertile -- have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do.
Now get out your handkerchiefs here.
You're going to see, in just two weeks, the normal worms are old.
You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there.
But everything else is just lying there.
The animal's clearly in the nursing home.
And if you look at the tissues of the animal, they're starting to deteriorate.
You know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans -- which probably most of you haven't seen one -- you can tell they're old -- isn't that interesting?
So there's something about aging that's kind of universal.
And now here is the daf-2 mutant.
One gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it.
It's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home; it's going skiing.
This is what's really cool: it's aging more slowly.
It takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day.
And when I tell people about this, they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person who looks really good for being 90 or 80.
But it's really more like this: let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s -- and you're a bachelor and you're dating people.
And you meet someone you really like, you get to know her.
And you're in a restaurant, and you say, "Well how old are you?"
She says, "I'm 60."
That's what it's like. And you would never know.
You would never know, until she told you.
Okay.
So what is the daf-2 gene?
Well as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA, they're instructions to make a protein that does something.
And the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor.
So what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell.
So part of it is like a baseball glove.
Part of it's on the outside, and it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green.
And the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell.
Okay, so what is the daf-2 receptor telling the inside of the cell?
I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell, that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well; the animal lives longer.
So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging.
That's what that arrow means.
It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.
So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself, speeding up aging.
So this is altogether really, really interesting.
It says that aging is subject to control by the genes, and specifically by hormones.
So what kind of hormones are these?
There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin.
You know about a lot of them.
These hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies.
The daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and IGF-1.
Now you've all heard of at least insulin.
Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal.
And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.
So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time, but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about -- maybe they also affect aging.
And it's looking like that's the case.
So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans, people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation, the hormone receptor mutation, in other animals, will they live longer?
And that is the case in flies.
If you change this hormone pathway in flies, they live longer.
And also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us.
So it's an ancient pathway, because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals.
And also, the common precursor also gave rise to people.
So maybe it's working in people the same way.
And there are hints of this.
So for example, there was one study that was done in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City.
And just like any population, most of the people live to be about 70 or 80, but some live to be 90 or 100.
And what they found was that people who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have daf-2 mutations -- that is, changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for IGF-1.
And these changes made the gene not act as well as the normal gene would have acted.
It damaged the gene.
So those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of the hormones for aging.
So the next question, of course, is: Is there any effect on age-related disease?
As you age, you're much more likely to get cancer, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, all sorts of diseases.
It turns out that these long-lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases.
They hardly get cancer, and when they do it's not as severe.
So it's really interesting, and it makes sense in a way, that they're still young, so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old?
So it suggests that, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans, maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age-related diseases all at once.
So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?
How could that work?
Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants, a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues, and repair damage.
And the way that they're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO.
So in a daf-2 mutant -- you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.
The receptor isn't working as well.
Under those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue has gone into the nucleus -- that little compartment there in the middle of the cell -- and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.
You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.
And it's just sitting on one of them.
So FOXO turns on a lot of genes.
And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes, genes I call carrot-giver genes, whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well -- to fold correctly and function correctly.
And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they're damaged.
DNA repair genes are more active in these animals.
And the immune system is more active.
And many of these different genes, we've shown, actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant.
So it's really interesting.
These animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.
They have the ability to protect themselves from many kinds of damage, which we think makes them live longer.
So what about the normal worm?
Well when the daf-2 receptor is active, then it triggers a series of events that prevent FOXO from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is.
So it can't turn the genes on.
That's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan, until we have the daf-2 mutant.
But what good is this for the worm?
Well we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions -- in the good times -- when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment.
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients.
You can store the food, use it for energy, grow, etc.
But what we think is that, under conditions of stress, the levels of these hormones drop -- for example, having limited food supply.
And that, we think, is registered by the animal as a danger signal, a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity.
So it activates FOXO, FOXO goes to the DNA, and that triggers the expression of these genes that improves the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself.
And that's why we think the animals live longer.
So you can think of FOXO as being like a building superintendent.
So maybe he's a little bit lazy, but he's there, he's taking care of the building.
But it's deteriorating.
And then suddenly, he learns that there's going to be a hurricane.
So he doesn't actually do anything himself.
He gets on the telephone -- just like FOXO gets on the DNA -- and he calls up the roofer, the window person, the painter, the floor person.
And they all come and they fortify the house.
And then the hurricane comes through, and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.
And not only that, it can also just last longer, even if there isn't a hurricane.
So that's the concept here for how we think this life extension ability exists.
Now the really cool thing about FOXO is that there are different forms of it.
We all have FOXO genes, but we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene.
Just like we all have eyes, but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.
And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100.
And that's the case all over the world, as you can see from these stars.
And each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked, "Okay, are there differences in the type of FOXO genes among people who live a really long time?" and there are.
We don't know the details of how this works, but we do know then that FOXO genes can impact the lifespan of people.
And that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit, we can increase the health and longevity of people.
So this is really exciting to me.
A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round worms to affect lifespan, and here it affects lifespan in people.
So we've been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this FOXO cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age-related diseases.
And I'm really optimistic that this is going to work.
There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.
And for at least one of them, there is a drug.
There's one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor, like the insulin pathway.
And mutations that damage the TOR gene -- just like the daf-2 mutations -- extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice.
But in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the TOR protein and inhibits its activity.
And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse -- even when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human, that old for a mouse -- if you give the mouse rapamycin, it will live longer.
Now I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin.
It is a drug for people, but the reason is it suppresses the immune system.
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected.
So this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer.
But still, here in the year 2011, there's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan, which comes out of this science that's been done in all these different animals.
So I'm really optimistic, and I think it won't be too long, I hope, before this age-old dream begins to come true.
Thank you.
Matt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia.
Let me get this straight.
Although you're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me, what you could do now pretty well in the lab, if you were allowed ethically, is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer?
CK: Ah, so the kinds of drugs I was talking about would not change the genes, they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity.
So if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.
You could change the genes in principle.
There isn't the technology to do that.
But I don't think that's a good idea.
And the reason is that these hormones, like the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway, they're essential.
If you knock them out completely, then you're very sick.
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems.
And I think that's much better, that kind of control would be much better as a drug.
And also, there are other ways of activating FOXO that don't even involve insulin or IGF-1 that might even be safer.
MR: I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it, but ...
There's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about, which is a negligible senescence.
There are some creatures on this planet already that don't really do aging.
Just move to one side for us, if you would.
CK: There are. There are some animals that don't seem to age.
For example, there are some tortoises called Blanding's turtles.
And they grow to be about this size.
And they've been tagged, and they've been found to be 70 years old.
And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles, you can't tell the difference, just by looking, between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles.
And the 70 year-old ones, actually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places, and they also have more progeny every year.
And there are other examples of these kinds of animals, like turns, certain kinds of birds are like this.
And nobody knows if they really can live forever, or what keeps them from aging.
It's not clear.
If you look at birds, which live a long time, cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide, things like that.
And our long-lived mutants are too.
They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses.
So it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about, which are set to run really quickly in the worm, have a different normal set point in something like a bird, so that a bird can live a lot longer.
And maybe they're even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don't know.
MR: But what you're talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing death, so much as extending human youthspan.
CK: Yes, that's right.
It's more like, say, if you were a dog.
You notice that you're getting old, and you look at your human and you think, "Why isn't this human getting old?"
They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan.
It's more like that.
But now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human.
MR: Thank you very much indeed, Cynthia Kenyon.

So I was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers: Thomas Starzl, who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967, and Sir Roy Calne, who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K.
in the following year.
I returned to Singapore and, in 1990, performed Asia's first successful cadaveric liver transplant procedure, but against all odds.
Now when I look back, the transplant was actually the easiest part.
Next, raising the money to fund the procedure.
But perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators -- a matter which was debated in the parliament -- that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country.
But 20 years on, my patient, Surinder, is Asia's longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date.
And perhaps more important, I am the proud godmother to her 14 year-old son.
But not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate.
The truth is, there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around.
As the demand for donor organs continues to rise, in large part due to the aging population, the supply has remained relatively constant.
In the United States alone, 100,000 men, women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs, and more than a dozen die each day because of a lack of donor organs.
The transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation.
And the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living, related donors -- relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ, like a split liver graft, to a relative or loved one.
But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs, the gift of life was then extended from living, related donors to now living, unrelated donors.
And this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy.
How can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from, for example, a submissive spouse, an in-law, a servant, a slave, an employee?
Where and how can we draw the line?
In my part of the world, too many people live below the poverty line.
And in some areas, the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living, unrelated donors.
Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant, I received my next assignment, and that was to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners.
I was also pregnant at the time.
Pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman's life.
But my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts -- thoughts of walking through the prison's high-security death row, as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room.
And at each time, I would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me.
And for two years, I struggled with the dilemma of waking up at 4:30 am on a Friday morning, driving to the prison, getting down, gloved and scrubbed, ready to receive the body of an executed prisoner, remove the organs and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital and then graft the gift of life to a recipient the same afternoon.
No doubt, I was informed, the consent had been obtained.
But, in my life, the one fulfilling skill that I had was now invoking feelings of conflict -- conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk.
In my team, the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience.
Some of us may have been sublimated, but really none of us remained the same.
I was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos.
And in my mind, I realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence.
It made me wonder if there could be a better way -- a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide.
Now just about that time, the practice of surgery evolved from big to small, from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures, tiny incisions.
And in transplantation, concepts shifted from whole organs to cells.
In 1988, at the University of Minnesota, I participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants.
I witnessed the technical difficulty.
And this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells.
I thought to myself, why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas -- the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes -- and transplant these cells? -- technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ.
And at that time, stem cell research had gained momentum, following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the 1990s.
The observation that stem cells, as master cells, could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types -- heart cells, liver cells, pancreatic islet cells -- captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public.
I too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology, and this inspired a shift in my mindset, from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells.
And I focused my research on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants.
Today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells.
Embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage, chiefly because of their pluripotency -- that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types.
But the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells -- the fact that these cells are derived from five-day old human embryos -- has encouraged research into other types of stem cells.
Now to the ridicule of my colleagues, I inspired my lab to focus on what I thought was the most non-controversial source of stem cells, adipose tissue, or fat, yes fat -- nowadays available in abundant supply -- you and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway.
Fat-derived stem cells are adult stem cells.
And adult stem cells are found in you and me -- in our blood, in our bone marrow, in our fat, our skin and other organs.
And as it turns out, fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells.
But adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells.
And here is the limitation: adult stem cells are mature cells, and, like mature human beings, these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types, as embryonic stem cells [can].
But in 2007, two remarkable individuals, Shinya Yamanaka of Japan and Jamie Thomson of the United States, made an astounding discovery.
They discovered that adult cells, taken from you and me, could be reprogrammed back into embryonic-like cells, which they termed IPS cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells.
And so guess what, scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells -- aging adult cells from you and me -- they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful IPS cells.
And in our lab, we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells -- cells that we may use to then form other, more specialized, cells, which one day may be used as cell transplants.
If this research is successful, it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos.
Indeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions.
Heart disease, stroke, diabetes, spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy, retinal eye diseases -- are any of these conditions relevant, personally, to you?
In May 2006, something horrible happened to me.
I was about to start a robotic operation, but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room, I realized that my left visual field was fast collapsing into darkness.
Earlier that week, I had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing -- yes, I fell.
And I started to see floaters and stars, which I casually dismissed as too much high-altitude sun exposure.
What happened to me might have been catastrophic, if not for the fact that I was in reach of good surgical access.
And I had my vision restored, but not before a prolonged period of convalescence -- three months -- in a head down position.
This experience taught me to empathize more with my patients, and especially those with retinal diseases.
37 million people worldwide are blind, and 127 million more suffer from impaired vision.
Stem cell-derived retinal transplants, now in a research phase, may one day restore vision, or part vision, to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide.
Indeed, we live in both challenging as well as exciting times.
As the world population ages, scientists are racing to discover new ways to enhance the power of the body to heal itself through stem cells.
It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured, our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation.
And these stem cells then float in the bloodstream and hone in to damaged organs to release growth factors to repair the damaged tissue.
Stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body, or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver.
As we speak, there are 117 or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases.
What lies ahead?
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.
1.1 million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly.
4.8 million suffer cardiac failure.
Stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function.
There are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease.
While still in a research phase, stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology.
Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings -- small, incremental steps, cells rather than organs, repair rather than replacement.
Stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need for donor organs.
Powerful new technologies always present enigmas.
As we speak, the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the USFDA approval.
And in the U.K., neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial.
The research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers.
Each one has his story.
My story has been about my journey from organs to cells -- a journey through controversy, inspired by hope -- hope that, as we age, you and I may one day celebrate longevity with an improved quality of life.
Thank you.

<title>Susan Lim: Transplant cells, not organs</title>
<description>Pioneering surgeon Susan Lim performed the first liver transplant in Asia. But a moral concern with transplants led her to look further, and to ask: Could we be transplanting cells, not whole organs? At the INK Conference, she talks through her new research, discovering healing cells in some surprising places.</description>
<keywords>business,technology</keywords>

Every year in the United States alone, 2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ...
and not to have sex with anyone else, ever.
He buys a ring, she buys a dress.
They go shopping for all sorts of things.
She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom dancing lessons.
And the big day comes.
And they'll stand before God and family and some guy her dad once did business with, and they'll vow that nothing, not abject poverty, not life-threatening illness, not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion.
These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb. weight gain, until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace.
You know, because they can't hear the snoring anymore.
And then they'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others' faces and do the "Macarena," and we'll be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time -- even though we know, statistically, half of them will be divorced within a decade.
Of course, the other half won't, right?
They'll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll.
And some of them will even still be enjoying each others' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore.
And researchers want to know why.
I mean, look, it doesn't take a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work.
Disrespect, boredom, too much time on Facebook, having sex with other people.
But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things -- respect, excitement, a broken Internet connection, mind-numbing monogamy -- and the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket.
So what's going on when it doesn't?
What do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common?
What are they doing right?
What can we learn from them?
And if you're still happily sleeping solo, why should you stop what you're doing and make it your life's work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life?
Well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out.
They stalk blissful couples and they study their every move and mannerism.
And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends.
And it turns out, the success stories share a few similarities, actually, beyond they don't have sex with other people.
For instance, in the happiest marriages, the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband.
Obvious, right.
It's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because, women, we care a great deal about being thin and good looking, whereas men mostly care about sex ...
ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are.
The beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy; we just have to be thinner than our partners.
So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising, we just need to wait for them to get fat, maybe bake a few pies.
This is good information to have, and it's not that complicated.
Research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives.
For example, the happy wife.
Instead of pointing out her husband's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run, she might say, "Wow, honey, thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner."
These are couples who can find good in any situation.
"Yeah, it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire, but it's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars, and it's a good thing you've got all that body fat to keep us warm."
One of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work, the more attractive his wife will find him.
Because we needed a study to tell us this.
But here's what's going on here.
The more attractive she finds him, the more sex they have; the more sex they have, the nicer he is to her; the nicer he is to her, the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed -- and ultimately, they live happily ever after.
In other words, men, you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department.
Here's an interesting one.
One study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce.
This is an actual study, and let me clarify.
The researchers were not looking at documented self-reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals.
The data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures.
Now I don't know how old all of you are, but when I was a kid, your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film, and, by God, film was expensive.
They didn't take 300 shots of you in that rapid-fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest, smileyest one for the Christmas card.
Oh no.
They dressed you up, they lined you up, and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye.
But still, I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and I'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce.
So what else can you do to safeguard your marriage?
Do not win an Oscar for best actress.
I'm serious.
Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford, Hallie Berry, Hillary Swank, Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon, all of them single soon after taking home that statue.
They actually call it the Oscar curse.
It is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided.
And it's not just successfully starring in films that's dangerous.
It turns out, merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet.
Apparently, the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us, but it obviously hasn't and it probably never will, makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison.
And theoretically, I suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash, we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we've got it pretty good.
Drinking alcohol, it seems, is bad for your marriage.
Yeah.
I can't tell you anymore about that one because I stopped reading it at the headline.
But here's a scary one: Divorce is contagious.
That's right -- when you have a close couple friend split up, it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent.
Now I have to say, I don't get this one at all.
My husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony.
And I'm thinking they've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could.
So now you may be wondering, why does anyone get married ever?
Well the U.S. federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone's spouse -- a list that includes visitation rights in jail, but hopefully you'll never need that one.
But beyond the profound federal perks, married people make more money.
We're healthier, physically and emotionally.
We produce happier, more stable and more successful kids.
We have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends -- believe it or not.
We even live longer, which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place.
Now if you're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return, I can't tell you how to find a chore-loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce, but I can only encourage you to try, because the benefits, as I've pointed out, are significant.
The bottom line is, whether you're in it or you're searching for it, I believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting.
So I hope you'll use the information I've given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors.
For instance, in my marriage, I'd say I'm doing okay.
One the one hand, I have a husband who's annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome.
So I'm obviously going to need fatten him up.
And like I said, we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up.
So we have to keep an eye on that.
And we do like a cocktail or two.
On the other hand, I have the fake happy picture thing.
And also, my husband does a lot around the house, and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives.
So I've got all those things going for me.
But just in case, I plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon.
And for the good of your relationships, I would encourage you to do the same.
I'll see you at the bar.

<title>Jenna McCarthy: What you don't know about marriage</title>
<description>In this funny, casual talk from TEDx, writer Jenna McCarthy shares surprising research on how marriages really work. One tip: Do not try to win an Oscar for best actress. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>
<keywords>culture,humor,love,relationships,sex</keywords>

I can't help but with this wish to think about when you're a little kid and you -- all your friends ask you if a genie could give you one wish in the world, what would it be?
And I always answered, "Well, I'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for."
Well, then you'd be screwed because you'd know what to wish for and you'd used up your wish.
And now, since we only have one wish -- unlike last year they had three wishes -- I'm not going to wish for that.
So let's get to what I would like, which is world peace.
And I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking, the poor girl up there -- she thinks she's at a beauty pageant.
She's not. She's at the TED Prize.
But I really do think it makes sense, and I think that the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other.
I've met a lot of different people over the years and I've filmed some of them -- from a dotcom executive in New York that wanted to take over the world to a military press officer in Qatar that would rather not take over the world.
If you've seen the film "Control Room" that was sent out, you'd understand a little bit why. Thank you.
Wow! Some of you watched it.
That's great. That's great.
So basically what I'd like to talk about today is a way for people to travel, to meet people in a different way than -- because you can't travel all over the world at the same time.
And a long time ago -- well, about 40 years ago -- my mom had an exchange student.
And I'm going to show you slides of the exchange student.
This is Donna.
This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty.
This is my mother and aunt teaching Donna how to ride a bike.
This is Donna eating ice cream.
And this is Donna teaching my aunt how to do a Filipino dance.
Now I really think as the world is getting smaller, it becomes more and more important that we learn each other's dance moves, that we meet each other, we get to know each other, we are able to figure out a way to cross borders, to understand each other, to understand people's hopes and dreams, what makes them laugh and cry.
And I know that we can't all do exchange programs, and I can't force everybody to travel.
I've already talked about that to Chris and Amy, and they said that there's a problem with this.
You can't force people of free will, and I totally support that.
So we're not forcing people to travel.
But I'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane, and just requires a movie camera, a projector and a screen.
And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today.
I was asked that I speak a little bit about where I personally come from, and Cameron, I don't know how you managed to get out of that one, but I think that building bridges is important to me because of where I come from.
I'm the daughter of an American mother and an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father.
So I'm the living product of two cultures coming together.
No pun intended.
And I've also been called -- as an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American with a Persian name -- the "Middle East Peace Crisis."
So maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way to bring both sides of my family together, a way to take the worlds with me, a way to tell stories visually.
It all kind of started that way, but I think that I really realized the power of the image when I first went to the garbage-collecting village in Egypt, when I was about 16. My mother took me there.
She's somebody that believes strongly in community service and decided that this was something that I needed to do and so I went there and I met some amazing women there.
There was a center there where they were teaching people how to read and write and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage.
And I began to start teaching there.
I taught English, and I met some incredible women there.
I met people that live seven people to a room, barely can afford their evening meal, yet live with this strength of spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities.
I got drawn into this community and I began to take pictures there.
I took pictures of weddings and older family members, things that they wanted memories of.
About two years after I started taking these pictures, the UN Conference on Population and Development asked me to show them at the conference.
So I was 18; I was very excited.
It was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there, and after about two days, they all came down except for three.
People were very upset, very angry that I was showing these dirty sides of Cairo, and why didn't I cut the dead donkey out of the frame?
And as I sat there, I got very depressed.
I looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs that were, you know, very pretty photographs and I was like, I failed at this.
But I was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out of people just seeing these photographs.
I mean, here I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak that nobody listened to, and all of a sudden I put these photographs on the wall and there were arguments, and they had to be taken down.
And I just saw the power of the image.
And it was incredible.
And I think the most important reaction that I saw there was actually people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves, that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances.
And I think it was at that point that I decided that I wanted to use photography and film to somehow bridge gaps, to bridge cultures, bring people together, cross borders.
And so that's what really kind of started me off.
Did a stint at MTV, made a film called "Startup.com," and I've done a couple of music films -- but in 2003, when the war in Iraq was about to start, it was a very surreal feeling for me because before the war started, there was kind of this media war that was going on.
And I was watching television in New York and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across, and the coverage went from the U.S. State Department to embedded troops and what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings, and the Iraqis would be greeting the Americans as liberators and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of Baghdad.
And I knew that there was a completely other story that was taking place in the Middle East where my parents were.
I knew that there was a completely other story being told, and I was thinking, how are people supposed to communicate with each other when they're getting completely different messages and nobody knows what the other's being told?
How are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future?
So I knew that I had to go there.
I just wanted to be in the center.
I had no plan. I had no funding.
I didn't even have a camera at the time.
I had somebody bring it there because I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera, George Bush's favorite channel and a place which I was very curious about because it's disliked by many governments across the Arab world and also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden by some people in the U.S. government.
So I was thinking, you know, this station that's hated by so many people has to be doing something right.
I've got to go see what this is all about.
And I also wanted to go see Central Command, which was 10 minutes away, and that way I could get access to how this news was being created on the Arab side reaching the Arab world, and on the U.S. and Western side reaching the U.S.
And when I went there and sat there, and met these people that were in the center of it and sat with these characters, I met some surprising, very complex people.
And I'd like to share with you a little bit of that experience of when you sit with somebody and you film them, and you listen to them, and you allow them more than a five-second sound bite, the amazing complexity of people emerge.
Sameer Khader: Business as usual.
Iraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq.
But between us, if I'm offered a job with Fox, I'll take it.
To change the Arab nightmare into the American dream.
I still have that dream.
Maybe I will never be able to do it.
But I have plans for my children.
When they finish their high school I will send them to America to study there.
I will pay for their study.
And they will stay there.
Josh Rushing: The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers -- Al Jazeera showed them -- it was powerful because America doesn't show those kinds of images.
Most of the news in America won't show really gory images and this showed American soldiers in uniform strewn about a floor, a cold tile floor.
And it was revolting.
It was absolutely revolting.
It made me sick to my stomach.
And then what hit me was, the night before, there had been some kind of bombing in Basra, and Al Jazeera had shown images of the people.
And they were equally if not more horrifying -- the images were.
And I remember having seen it in the Al Jazeera office and thought to myself, "Wow, that's gross.
That's bad."
And then going away, and probably eating dinner or something.
And it didn't affect me as much.
So -- the impact it had on me, me realizing that I just saw people on the other side, and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way I was feeling that night.
And it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't bothered as much the night before.
It makes me hate war.
But it doesn't make me believe that we're in world that can live without war yet.
Jehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed by the response of the film, for we didn't know whether it would be able to get out there.
We had no funding for it.
We were incredibly lucky that it got picked up, and when we showed the film in both the United States and the Arab world we had such incredible reactions.
It was amazing to see how people were moved by this film.
In the Arab world -- and it's not really by the film; it's by the characters.
I mean, Josh Rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things.
And when I showed the film in the Middle East, people wanted to meet Josh.
He kind of redefined us as an American population.
People started to, you know, ask me, where is this guy now?
Al Jazeera offered him a job.
And Sameer, on the other hand, was also quite an interesting character for the Arab world to see, because it brought out the complexities of this love/hate relationship that the Arab world has with the West.
In the United States, I was blown away by the motivations, the positive motivations of the American people when they'd see this film.
You know, we're criticized abroad for believing we're the saviors of the world in some way, but the flip side of it is that actually, when people do see what is happening abroad and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad, we feel this power that we need to -- we feel like we have to get the power to change things.
And I saw this with audiences.
This woman came up to me after the screening and said, "You know, I know this is crazy. I saw the bombs being loaded on the planes; I saw the military going out to war.
But you don't understand people's anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war, and how do we get out of this bubble?
How do we understand what the other person is thinking?"
Now, I don't know whether a film can change the world, but I know that it starts -- I know the power of it -- I know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world.
Now, I'm not a philosopher, so I feel like I shouldn't go into great depth on this but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world.
Because I believe that film has the ability to take you across borders.
I'd like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world.
And these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts that we are faced with today.
As long as there is injustice, someone must make a sacrifice!
That's no sacrifice, that's revenge!
If you kill, there's no difference between victim and occupier.
If we had airplanes, we wouldn't need martyrs, that's the difference.
The difference is that the Israeli military is still stronger.
Then let us be equal in death.
We still have Paradise.
There is no Paradise! It only exists in your head!
God forbid!
May God forgive you.
If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...
Anyway, I'd rather have Paradise in my head than live in this hell!
In this life, we're dead anyway.
One only chooses bitterness when the alternative is even bitterer.
And what about us? The ones who remain?
Will we win that way?
Don't you see what you're doing is destroying us?
And that you give Israel an alibi to carry on?
So with no alibi, Israel will stop?
Perhaps. We have to turn it into a moral war.
How, if Israel has no morals?
Be careful!
Tzvika: My wife Ayelet called me and said, "There was a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv."
Ayelet: What do you know about the casualties?
We're looking for three girls.
Tzvika: We have no information.
Ayelet: One is wounded here, but we haven't heard from the other three.
Tzvika: I said, "OK, that's Bat-Chen, that's my daughter.
Are you sure she is dead?"
They said yes.
George: On that day, at around 6:30 I was driving with my wife and daughters to the supermarket.
When we got to here, we saw three Israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road.
When we passed by the first jeep, they opened fire on us.
And my 12-year-old daughter Christine was killed in the shooting.
I am the headmaster for all parts.
George: But there is a teacher that is in charge?
Tzvika: Yes, I have assistants.
I deal with children all the time.
George: At first, I thought it was a strange idea.
But after thinking logically about it, I didn't find any reason why not to meet them and let them know of our suffering.
George: There were many things that touched me.
We see that there are Palestinians who suffered a lot, who lost children, and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation.
If we who lost what is most precious can talk to each other, and look forward to a better future, then everyone else must do so, too.
Song is something that we communicated with people who otherwise would not have understood where we're coming from.
You could give them a long political speech they would still not understand.
But I tell you, when you finish that song, people will be like, "Damn, I know where you niggaz are coming from.
I know where you guys are coming from.
Death unto apartheid!"
It's about the liberation struggle.
It's about those children who took to the streets, fighting, screaming, "Free Nelson Mandela!"
It's about those unions who put down their tools and demanded freedom.
Yes. Yes!
Freedom!
Jehane Noujaim: I think everybody's had that feeling of sitting in a theater, in a dark room, with other strangers, watching a very powerful film, and they felt that feeling of transformation.
And what I'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film?
I've been listening to the talks in some of the conference, and Robert Wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity, then they will have an appreciation for ours.
And that's what this is about.
It's about connecting people through film, getting these independent voices out there.
Now Josh Rushing actually ended up leaving the military and taking a job with Al Jazeera, so his feeling is that he's on Al Jazeera International because he feels like he can actually use media to bridge the gap between East and West.
And that's an amazing thing.
But I've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices, to give power to the filmmakers, to give power to people who are trying to use film for change.
And there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already.
There's Witness, that you heard from earlier.
There's Just Vision, that are working with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace, and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack, and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this.
There's Working Films and there's Current TV, which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their -- yes, it's amazing.
I watched it and I'm just -- I'm blown away by it and its potential to bring voices from around the world, independent voices from around the world, and create a truly democratic, global television.
So what can we do to create a platform for these organizations, to create some momentum, to get everybody in the world involved in this movement?
I'd like for us to imagine for a second -- imagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world.
You have towns and villages and theaters all from around the world getting together, and sitting in the dark, and sharing a communal experience of watching a film, or a couple of films, together.
Watching a film which maybe highlights a character that is fighting to live, or just a character that defies stereotypes, makes a joke, sings a song.
Comedies, documentaries, shorts.
This amazing power can be used to change people and to bond people together, to cross borders and have people feel like they're having a communal experience.
So if you imagine this day when all around the world you have theaters from around the world and places where we project films.
If you imagine from -- projecting from Times Square to Tahir Square in Cairo, the same film in Ramallah, the same film in Jerusalem.
You know, we've been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the Great Pyramid and the Great Wall of China.
It's endless what you can imagine, in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience.
And I believe that this one day, if we can create it, this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices.
There isn't an organization which is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there, and yet I'm hearing throughout this conference that the biggest danger in our future is [lack of] understanding the other and having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders.
And if film can do that, and if we can get all of these different locations in the world to watch these films together, this could be an incredible day.
So we've already made a partnership actually, set up through somebody from the TED community, John Camen, introduced me to Steven Apkon, from the Jacob Burns Film Center.
And we started calling up everybody.
And in the last week, there have been so many people that have responded to us from as close as Palo Alto to Mongolia and to India.
There are people that want to be a part of this global day of film, to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there.
Now, we've thought about a name for this day and I'd like to share this with you.
Now, the most amazing part of this whole process has been sharing ideas and wishes, and so I invite you to give brainstorms onto how does this day echo into the future?
How do we use technology to make this day echo into the future, so that we can build community and have these communities working together, through the Internet?
There was a time, many, many years ago, when all of the continents were stuck together.
And we called that landmass Pangea.
So what we'd like to call this day of film is Pangea Cinema Day.
And if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching, then I think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better.
I know that it's very intangible, touching people's hearts and souls, but the only way that I know how to do it, the only way that I know how to reach out to somebody's heart and soul all across the world is by showing them a film.
And I know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there that can really make this happen.
And that's my wish.
So I guess I'm supposed to give you my one-sentence wish, but we're way out of time.
That is an incredible wish.
Pangea Cinema -- the day the world comes together.
JN: It's more tangible than world peace, and it's certainly more immediate.
But it would be the day that the world comes together through film, the power of film.
Ladies and gentlemen, Jehane Noujaim.

We're here to celebrate compassion.
But compassion, from my vantage point, has a problem.
As essential as it is across our traditions, as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives, the word "compassion" is hollowed out in our culture, and it is suspect in my field of journalism.
It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing, or it's seen as potentially depressing.
Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story of giving a speech in Holland and, after the fact, the word "compassion" was translated as "pity."
Now compassion, when it enters the news, too often comes in the form of feel-good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self-sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time.
Our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images.
And so what I'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection.
And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter, that they shape the way we understand ourselves, the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others.
When this country first encountered genuine diversity in the 1960s, we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that.
Now the word "tolerance," if you look at it in the dictionary, connotes "allowing," "indulging" and "enduring."
In the medical context that it comes from, it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment.
Tolerance is not really a lived virtue; it's more of a cerebral ascent.
And it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough.
And the going is pretty rough right now.
I think that without perhaps being able to name it, we are collectively experiencing that we've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue.
Compassion is a worthy successor.
It is organic, across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions, and yet it transcends them.
Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others, both in our private and in our civic spaces.
So what is it, three-dimensionally?
What are its kindred and component parts?
What's in its universe of attendant virtues?
To start simply, I want to say that compassion is kind.
Now "kindness" might sound like a very mild word, and it's prone to its own abundant cliche.
But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues.
And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification.
Compassion is also curious.
Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity.
I love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles, Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi.
They are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young Jews and Muslims, and as they do that, they cultivate what they call "curiosity without assumptions."
Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion.
Compassion can be synonymous with empathy.
It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation, but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence.
It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there, just showing up.
I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty -- and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other, not just what it is about them that might need helping.
I love it that my Muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value.
And in that light, for the religious, compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty, but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering, in the face of a stranger, in the face of the vibrant religious other.
I'm not sure if I can show you what tolerance looks like, but I can show you what compassion looks like -- because it is visible.
When we see it, we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable, what is possible.
It is so important when we're communicating big ideas -- but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion -- to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood -- the color and complexity of life.
And compassion does seek physicality.
I first started to learn this most vividly from Matthew Sanford.
And I don't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him, but he's paraplegic.
He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13, in a car crash that killed his father and his sister.
Matthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again, and -- and he does experience this as an "and" rather than a "but" -- and he experiences himself to be healed and whole.
And as a teacher of yoga, he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability, health, illness and aging.
He says that he's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we're all on.
He's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.
And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit.
I can't quite explain it, and he can't either.
But he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body, in all its frailty and its grace, without, at the same time, becoming more compassionate towards all of life.
Compassion also looks like this.
This is Jean Vanier.
Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities, which you can now find all over the world, communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities -- mostly Down syndrome.
The communities that Jean Vanier founded, like Jean Vanier himself, exude tenderness.
"Tender" is another word I would love to spend some time resurrecting.
We spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive, and I spend a lot of time being those things too.
And compassion can also have those qualities.
But again and again, lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness.
Jean Vanier says that his work, like the work of other people -- his great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa -- is never in the first instance about changing the world; it's in the first instance about changing ourselves.
He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution, but a sign.
Compassion is rarely a solution, but it is always a sign of a deeper reality, of deeper human possibilities.
And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories, never by statistics and strategies.
We need those things too, but we're also bumping up against their limits.
And at the same time that we are doing that, I think we are rediscovering the power of story -- that as human beings, we need stories to survive, to flourish, to change.
Our traditions have always known this, and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us.
There is, of course, a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world -- tikkun olam.
And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen, who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her, that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces.
It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation.
And that the highest human calling is to look for this light, to point at it when we see it, to gather it up, and in so doing, to repair the world.
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale.
Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way.
Rachel Naomi Remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time, because this story insists that each and every one of us, frail and flawed as we may be, inadequate as we may feel, has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch.
Stories like this, signs like this, are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us.
Rachel Naomi Remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors.
And this trend of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing, how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine -- the work Fred Luskin is doing -- I think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the 21st century -- that science, in fact, is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism.
This is going to change science, I believe, and it will change religion.
But here's a face from 20th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion.
We all know about the Albert Einstein who came up with E = mc2.
We don't hear so much about the Einstein who invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson, to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn't have her.
We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in Europe or the Scottsboro boys in the American South.
Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions.
But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century.
He once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three-year-old.
And Einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced, we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more, not less.
He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages.
Some of his favorites were Moses, Jesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi, Gandhi -- he adored his contemporary, Gandhi.
And Einstein said -- and I think this is a quote, again, that has not been passed down in his legacy -- that "these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living, more necessary to the dignity, security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge."
Now invoking Einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us, but actually it is.
I want to show you the rest of this photograph, because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word "compassion" in our culture -- we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life, which is messy.
So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it's not.
This is the full photograph, and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket, smoking a cigar.
And by the look of that paunch, he hasn't been doing enough yoga.
We put these two photographs side-by-side on our website, and someone said, "When I look at the first photo, I ask myself, what was he thinking?
And when I look at the second, I ask, what kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?"
Well, he was complicated.
He was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others.
And it is much harder, often, to be compassionate towards those closest to us, which is another quality in the universe of compassion, on its dark side, that also deserves our serious attention and illumination.
Gandhi, too, was a real flawed human being.
So was Martin Luther King, Jr. So was Dorothy Day.
So was Mother Teresa.
So are we all.
And I want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion -- following on what Fred Luskin says -- that these flaws just make us human.
Our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems.
But what a liberating thing to realize that our problems, in fact, are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion, towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others.
Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor because of her life-long struggle with Crohn's disease.
Einstein became a humanitarian, not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter, but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist.
And Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that, with a zigzag, have led to the Charter for Compassion.
Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity.
So I want to propose a final definition of compassion -- this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way -- and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology.
Now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this, and we need them to mine it for us now.
But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious.
So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing and say that humanity, the future of humanity, needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race.
Thank you.

<title>Krista Tippett: Reconnecting with compassion</title>
<description>The term "compassion" -- typically reserved for the saintly or the sappy -- has fallen out of touch with reality. At a special TEDPrize@UN, journalist Krista Tippett deconstructs the meaning of compassion through several moving stories, and proposes a new, more attainable definition for the word.</description>
<keywords>charter for compassion,compassion,faith,religion,science</keywords>

When I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time.
And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books, which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do.
Because in my family, reading was the primary group activity.
And this might sound antisocial to you, but for us it was really just a different way of being social.
You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you, but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind.
And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this, but better.
I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns.
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol.
And on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit.
And it went like this: "R-O-W-D-I-E, that's the way we spell rowdie.
Rowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."
Yeah.
So I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy, or why we had to spell this word incorrectly.
But I recited a cheer. I recited a cheer along with everybody else.
I did my best.
And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books.
But the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase, the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me, "Why are you being so mellow?" -- mellow, of course, being the exact opposite of R-O-W-D-I-E.
And then the second time I tried it, the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing.
And so I put my books away, back in their suitcase, and I put them under my bed, and there they stayed for the rest of the summer.
And I felt kind of guilty about this.
I felt as if the books needed me somehow, and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them.
But I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer.
Now, I tell you this story about summer camp.
I could have told you 50 others just like it -- all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go, that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert.
And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were.
But for years I denied this intuition, and so I became a Wall Street lawyer, of all things, instead of the writer that I had always longed to be -- partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too.
And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends.
And I made these self-negating choices so reflexively, that I wasn't even aware that I was making them.
Now this is what many introverts do, and it's our loss for sure, but it is also our colleagues' loss and our communities' loss.
And at the risk of sounding grandiose, it is the world's loss.
Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership, we need introverts doing what they do best.
A third to a half of the population are introverts -- a third to a half.
So that's one out of every two or three people you know.
So even if you're an extrovert yourself, I'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now -- all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society.
We all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing.
Now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is.
It's different from being shy.
Shyness is about fear of social judgment.
Introversion is more about, how do you respond to stimulation, including social stimulation.
So extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation, whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched-on and their most capable when they're in quieter, more low-key environments.
Not all the time -- these things aren't absolute -- but a lot of the time.
So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us.
But now here's where the bias comes in.
Our most important institutions, our schools and our workplaces, they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation.
And also we have this belief system right now that I call the new groupthink, which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place.
So if you picture the typical classroom nowadays: When I was going to school, we sat in rows.
We sat in rows of desks like this, and we did most of our work pretty autonomously.
But nowadays, your typical classroom has pods of desks -- four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other.
And kids are working in countless group assignments.
Even in subjects like math and creative writing, which you think would depend on solo flights of thought, kids are now expected to act as committee members.
And for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone, those kids are seen as outliers often or, worse, as problem cases.
And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert, even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable, according to research.
Okay, same thing is true in our workplaces.
Now, most of us work in open plan offices, without walls, where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers.
And when it comes to leadership, introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions, even though introverts tend to be very careful, much less likely to take outsize risks -- which is something we might all favor nowadays.
And interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do, because when they are managing proactive employees, they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas, whereas an extrovert can, quite unwittingly, get so excited about things that they're putting their own stamp on things, and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface.
Now in fact, some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts.
I'll give you some examples.
Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi -- all these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.
And they all took the spotlight, even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to.
And this turns out to have a special power all its own, because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm, not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at; they were there because they had no choice, because they were driven to do what they thought was right.
Now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts.
I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts, including my beloved husband.
And we all fall at different points, of course, along the introvert/extrovert spectrum.
Even Carl Jung, the psychologist who first popularized these terms, said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert.
He said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum, if he existed at all.
And some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum, and we call these people ambiverts.
And I often think that they have the best of all worlds.
But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other.
And what I'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance.
We need more of a yin and yang between these two types.
This is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity, because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people, what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas, but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them.
And this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity.
So Darwin, he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations.
Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla, California.
And he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona.
Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in Hewlett-Packard where he was working at the time.
And he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up.
Now of course, this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating -- and case in point, is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer -- but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe.
And in fact, we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude.
It's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it.
If you look at most of the world's major religions, you will find seekers -- Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad -- seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community.
So no wilderness, no revelations.
This is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology.
It turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring, mimicking their opinions.
Even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to, you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that that's what you're doing.
And groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room, even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas -- I mean zero.
So ...
You might be following the person with the best ideas, but you might not.
And do you really want to leave it up to chance?
Much better for everybody to go off by themselves, generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics, and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-managed environment and take it from there.
Now if all this is true, then why are we getting it so wrong?
Why are we setting up our schools this way and our workplaces?
And why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time?
One answer lies deep in our cultural history.
Western societies, and in particular the U.S., have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and "man" of contemplation.
But in America's early days, we lived in what historians call a culture of character, where we still, at that point, valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude.
And if you look at the self-help books from this era, they all had titles with things like "Character, the Grandest Thing in the World."
And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming.
Ralph Waldo Emerson called him "A man who does not offend by superiority."
But then we hit the 20th century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality.
What happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business.
And so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities.
And instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives, now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers.
So, quite understandably, qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important.
And sure enough, the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like "How to Win Friends and Influence People."
And they feature as their role models really great salesmen.
So that's the world we're living in today.
That's our cultural inheritance.
Now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant, and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all.
The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust.
And the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together.
But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves, the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems.
So now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today.
Guess what?
Books.
I have a suitcase full of books.
Here's Margaret Atwood, "Cat's Eye."
Here's a novel by Milan Kundera.
And here's "The Guide for the Perplexed" by Maimonides.
But these are not exactly my books.
I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors.
My grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up, partly because it was filled with his very gentle, very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books.
I mean literally every table, every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books.
Just like the rest of my family, my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read.
But he also loved his congregation, and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi.
He would takes the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought.
And people would come from all over to hear him speak.
But here's the thing about my grandfather.
Underneath this ceremonial role, he was really modest and really introverted -- so much so that when he delivered these sermons, he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years.
And even away from the podium, when you called him to say hello, he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time.
But when he died at the age of 94, the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him.
And so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way.
So I just published a book about introversion, and it took me about seven years to write.
And for me, that seven years was like total bliss, because I was reading, I was writing, I was thinking, I was researching.
It was my version of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library.
But now all of a sudden my job is very different, and my job is to be out here talking about it, talking about introversion.
And that's a lot harder for me, because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now, this is not my natural milieu.
So I prepared for moments like these as best I could.
I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get.
And I call this my "year of speaking dangerously."
And that actually helped a lot.
But I'll tell you, what helps even more is my sense, my belief, my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude, we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change.
I mean, we are.
And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision.
Number one: Stop the madness for constant group work.
Just stop it.
Thank you.
And I want to be clear about what I'm saying, because I deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual, chatty cafe-style types of interactions -- you know, the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas.
That is great.
It's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts.
But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work.
School, same thing.
We need to be teaching kids to work together, for sure, but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own.
This is especially important for extroverted children too.
They need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part.
Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness.
Be like Buddha, have your own revelations.
I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again, but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often.
Number three: Take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there.
So extroverts, maybe your suitcases are also full of books.
Or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment.
Whatever it is, I hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy.
But introverts, you being you, you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase.
And that's okay.
But occasionally, just occasionally, I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see, because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry.
So I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.

<title>Susan Cain: The power of introverts</title>
<description>In a culture where being social and outgoing are prized above all else, it can be difficult, even shameful, to be an introvert. But, as Susan Cain argues in this passionate talk, introverts bring extraordinary talents and abilities to the world, and should be encouraged and celebrated.</description>
<keywords>business,culture,psychology</keywords>

So it's 1995, I'm in college, and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence, Rhode Island to Portland, Oregon.
And you know, we're young and unemployed, so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests -- basically the longest route we can possibly take.
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota, I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles.
"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?"
My friend looks at me totally blankly.
There's actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look.
And I'm like, "You know, all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them."
She just stares at me for a few moments, and then she cracks up, because she figures out what I'm talking about.
And what I'm talking about is this.
Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.
I've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this -- why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us, and how we behave when that happens, and what all of this can tell us about human nature.
In other words, as you heard Chris say, I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong.
This might strike you as a strange career move, but it actually has one great advantage: no job competition.
In fact, most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong, or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong.
We get it in the abstract.
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.
The human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine.
But when it comes down to me, right now, to all the beliefs I hold, here in the present tense, suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window -- and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.
And the thing is, the present tense is where we live.
We go to meetings in the present tense; we go on family vacations in the present tense; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense.
So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life, trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything.
I think this is a problem.
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals, in our personal and professional lives, and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.
So what I want to do today is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right.
And second, why it's such a problem.
And finally, I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so, it is the single greatest moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.
So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right?
One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.
So let me ask you guys something -- or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here: How does it feel -- emotionally -- how does it feel to be wrong?
Dreadful. Thumbs down.
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.
Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing -- thank you, these are great answers, but they're answers to a different question.
You guys are answering the question: How does it feel to realize you're wrong?
Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?
I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory, it can actually be quite funny, like my stupid Chinese character mistake.
But just being wrong doesn't feel like anything.
I'll give you an analogy.
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there's this pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?
In pretty much every episode of this cartoon, there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff, which is fine -- he's a bird, he can fly.
But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.
And what's funny -- at least if you're six years old -- is that the coyote's totally fine too.
He just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid-air.
That's when he falls.
When we're wrong about something -- not when we realize it, but before that -- we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.
You know, we're already wrong, we're already in trouble, but we feel like we're on solid ground.
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.
It does feel like something to be wrong; it feels like being right.
So this is one reason, a structural reason, why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.
I call this error blindness.
Most of the time, we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something, until it's too late.
But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural.
Think back for a moment to elementary school.
You're sitting there in class, and your teacher is handing back quiz papers, and one of them looks like this.
This is not mine, by the way.
So there you are in grade school, and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper.
It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker, the one who never does his homework.
So by the time you are nine years old, you've already learned, first of all, that people who get stuff wrong are lazy, irresponsible dimwits -- and second of all, that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes.
We learn these really bad lessons really well.
And a lot of us -- and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room -- deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students, perfectionists, over-achievers.
Right, Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?
You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.
Okay, so fine.
Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.
Because according to this, getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us.
So we just insist that we're right, because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe.
So let me tell you a story.
A couple of years ago, a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.
Beth Israel's in Boston.
It's the teaching hospital for Harvard -- one of the best hospitals in the country.
So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.
She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing -- stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.
Everything seems to have gone fine.
And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself, and she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?"
Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one.
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident, he said something very interesting.
He said, "For whatever reason, the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient."
The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous.
This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world.
And when we act like it is, and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong, well that's when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or torpedoing the global economy.
So this is a huge practical problem.
But it's also a huge social problem.
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality.
And when you feel that way, you've got a problem to solve, which is, how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you?
It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way, by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant.
They don't have access to the same information that we do, and when we generously share that information with them, they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.
When that doesn't work, when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us, then we move on to a second assumption, which is that they're idiots.
They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.
And when that doesn't work, when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes.
So this is a catastrophe.
This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly.
But to me, what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human.
It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds.
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing.
That is not true, and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.
The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is.
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.
We can remember the past, and we can think about the future, and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place.
And we all do this a little differently, which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this.
And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about "I think therefore I am," this guy, St. Augustine, sat down and wrote "Fallor ergo sum" -- "I err therefore I am."
Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up, it's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system, something we can eradicate or overcome.
It's totally fundamental to who we are.
Because, unlike God, we don't really know what's going on out there.
And unlike all of the other animals, we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.
To me, this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity.
Last year, for various reasons, I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life.
And so I'm listening and I'm listening, and at some point, I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong.
And my first thought was, "I've lost it.
I've become the crazy wrongness lady.
I just imagined it everywhere," which has happened.
But a couple of months later, I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.
And I mentioned this to him, and he was like, "No actually, that's true.
In fact," he says, "as a staff, we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme.
And the crypto-theme is: 'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.' And the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.
We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work."
And for the rest of us, audience members, as listeners, as readers, we eat this stuff up.
We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings.
When it comes to our stories, we love being wrong.
But, you know, our stories are like this because our lives are like this.
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead.
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq, find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction, liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.
And something else happened instead.
And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life, until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.
And something else happened instead.
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.
And something else happened instead.
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize.
And something else happened instead.
I mean, this is life.
For good and for ill, we generate these incredible stories about the world around us, and then the world turns around and astonishes us.
No offense, but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong.
We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements, but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements?
Because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- TED 1998 -- eh.
Didn't really work out that way, did it?
Where's my jet pack, Chris?
So here we are again.
And that's how it goes.
We come up with another idea.
We tell another story.
We hold another conference.
The theme of this one, as you guys have now heard seven million times, is the rediscovery of wonder.
And to me, if you really want to rediscover wonder, you need to step outside of that tiny, terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say, "Wow, I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong."
Thank you.
Thank you guys.

<title>Kathryn Schulz: On being wrong</title>
<description>Most of us will do anything to avoid being wrong. But what if we're wrong about that? "Wrongologist" Kathryn Schulz makes a compelling case for not just admitting but embracing our fallibility.</description>
<keywords>culture,failure</keywords>

So I'm here to explain why I'm wearing these ninja pajamas.
And to do that, I'd like to talk first about environmental toxins in our bodies.
So some of you may know about the chemical Bisphenol A, BPA.
It's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that's found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics.
So BPA mimics the body's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems.
And it's everywhere.
A recent study found BPA in 93 percent of people six and older.
But it's just one chemical.
The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.
says we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies, and this includes preservatives, pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury.
To me, this says three things.
First, don't become a cannibal.
Second, we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution.
And third, our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins.
So what happens to all these toxins when we die?
The short answer is: They return to the environment in one way or another, continuing the cycle of toxicity.
But our current funeral practices make the situation much worse.
If you're cremated, all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere.
And this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year.
And in a traditional American funeral, a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive.
It's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition -- a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel.
So by trying to preserve our dead bodies, we deny death, poison the living and further harm the environment.
Green or natural burials, which don't use embalming, are a step in the right direction, but they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies.
I think there's a better solution.
I'm an artist, so I'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art, science and culture.
The Infinity Burial Project, an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies.
The Infinity Burial Project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the Infinity Mushroom -- a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies, clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots, leaving clean compost.
But I learned it's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom.
I also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms can clean environmental toxins in soil.
So I thought maybe I could train an army of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body.
So today, I'm collecting what I shed or slough off -- my hair, skin and nails -- and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms.
As the mushrooms grow, I pick the best feeders to become Infinity Mushrooms.
It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife.
So when I die, the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it.
All right, so for some of you, this may be really, really out there.
Just a little.
I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food.
We want to eat, not be eaten by, our food.
But as I watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body, I imagine the Infinity Mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment.
See for me, cultivating the Infinity Mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet, it's a step towards accepting the fact that someday I will die and decay.
It's also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet.
Growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice of cultivating decomposing organisms called decompiculture, a concept that was developed by an entomologist, Timothy Myles.
The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture I'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation -- the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies.
And now about these ninja pajamas.
Once it's completed, I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects.
First, a burial suit infused with mushroom spores, the Mushroom Death Suit.
I'm wearing the second prototype of this burial suit.
It's covered with a crocheted netting that is embedded with mushroom spores.
The dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia, which are the equivalent of plant roots.
I'm also making a decompiculture kit, a cocktail of capsules that contain Infinity Mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition and toxin remediation.
These capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly, a kind of second skin, which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms.
So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two, and then I'd like to begin testing them, first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects.
And believe it or not, a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms.
What I've learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment.
I wanted to cultivate this perspective just like the mushrooms, so I formed the Decompiculture Society, a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options, seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the Infinity Mushroom.
The Decompiculture Society shares a vision of a cultural shift, from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture, a radical acceptance of death and decomposition.
Accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment, as the research on environmental toxins confirms.
And the saying goes, we came from dust and will return to dust.
And once we understand that we're connected to the environment, we see that the survival of our species depends on the survival of the planet.
I believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility.
Thank you.

So I'd like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in China, the night I met my husband.
It was a city so long ago that it was still called Peking.
So I went to a party.
I sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie, and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar, there in China specifically to study Sino-Soviet relations.
What a gift it was to the eager, young foreign correspondent that I was then.
I'd pump him for information, I'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories I plan to write.
I talk to him for hours.
Only months later, I discover who he really was.
He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association.
"I don't understand. Soybeans?
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar."
"Well, how long would you have talked to me if I told you we're in soybeans?"
I said, "You jerk."
Only jerk wasn't the word I used.
I said, "You could've gotten me fired."
And he said, "Let's get married."
"Travel the world and have lots of kids."
So we did.
And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be.
He was a Chinese scholar who later, in his 60s, got a Ph.D. in Chinese history.
He spoke six languages, he played 15 musical instruments, he was a licensed pilot, he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator, he was an expert in swine nutrition, dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir, and we did travel the country, and the world, and we did have a lot of kids.
We followed my job, and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn't do.
So when we found the cancer, it doesn't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other, we believed that, if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough, and we worked hard enough, we could keep him from dying ever.
And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding.
The surgeon emerged from the surgery.
What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say: "We got it all."
Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely.
It turned out to be a rare, exceedingly aggressive type, with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most.
And yet, he did not die.
Mysteriously, he lived on.
He coached Little League for our son.
He built a playhouse for our daughter.
And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet looking for specialists.
I'm looking for a cure.
So a year goes by before the cancer, as cancers do, reappears, and with it comes another death sentence, this time nine months.
So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.
It makes him so sick, he has to quit it, yet still he lives on.
Then another year goes by.
Two years go by.
More specialists.
We take the kids to Italy.
We take the kids to Australia.
And then more years pass, and the cancer begins to grow.
This time, there's new treatments on the horizon.
They're exotic. They're experimental.
They're going to attack the cancer in new ways.
So he enters a clinical trial, and it works.
The cancer begins to shrink, and for the third time, we've dodged death.
So now I ask you, how do I feel when the time finally comes and there's another dark night, sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?
This time it's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that I've never met before tells me that Terence is dying, perhaps tonight.
So what do I say when he says, "What do you want me to do?"
There's another drug out there.
It's newer. It's more powerful.
He started it just two weeks ago.
Perhaps there's still hope ahead.
So what do I say?
I say, "Keep him alive if you can."
And Terence died six days later.
So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.
It was an exhilarating fight, and I'd repeat the fight today without a moment's hesitation.
We fought together, we lived together.
It turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious.
It was also an expensive fight.
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care, and of healthcare for all of us.
And for me, for us, we pushed the fight right over the edge, and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day: "Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride."
We never got the chance to say goodbye.
We never thought it was the end.
We always had hope.
So what do we make of all of this?
Being a journalist, after Terence died, I wrote a book, "The Cost Of Hope."
I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did, why he did what he did, why everyone around us did what they did.
And what did I discover?
Well, one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper, the advance directive, to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.
Yet I had that piece of paper.
We both did.
And they were readily available.
I had them right at hand.
Both of them said the same thing: Do nothing if there is no further hope.
I knew Terence's wishes as clearly and as surely as I knew my own.
Yet we never got to no further hope.
Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands, we just kept redefining hope.
I believed I could keep him from dying, and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way.
Right up until days before his death, I felt strongly and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally, that I could keep him from dying ever.
Now, what do the experts call this?
They say it's denial.
It's a strong word, isn't it?
Yet I will tell you that denial isn't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through.
And I hear the medical professionals say, "Well, we'd like to do such-and-such, but the family's in denial.
The family won't listen to reason.
They're in denial.
How can they insist on this treatment at the end?
It's so clear, yet they're in denial."
Now, I think this maybe isn't a very useful way of thinking.
It's not just families either.
The medical professionals too, you out there, you're in denial too.
You want to help. You want to fix.
You want to do.
You've succeeded in everything you've done, and having a patient die, well, that must feel like failure.
I saw it firsthand.
Just days before Terence died, his oncologist said, "Tell Terence that better days are just ahead."
Days before he died.
Yet Ira Byock, the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said, "You know, the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal."
So what the experts call "denial," I call "hope," and I'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design.
You just redefine denial and hope, and it becomes a feature of being human.
It's not a bug.
It's a feature.
So we need to think more constructively about this very common, very profound and very powerful human emotion.
It's part of the human condition, and yet our system and our thinking isn't built to accommodate it.
So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night, and I believed it.
Maybe I wanted to believe it.
And during Terence's illness, I, we, we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too.
Giving up the fight -- for that's how it felt, it felt like giving up -- meant giving up not only his life but also our story, our story of us as fighters, the story of us as invincible, and for the doctors, the story of themselves as healers.
So what do we need?
Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper.
Maybe we need a new story, not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness, but rather a story of victory and triumph, of a valiant battle and, eventually, a graceful retreat, a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe, that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal, and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried, has ever stopped even the bravest, wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go.
People did mention hospice, but I wouldn't listen.
Hospice was for people who were dying, and Terence wasn't dying.
As a result, he spent just four days in hospice, which I'm sure, as you all know, is a pretty typical outcome, and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end.
We have a noble path to curing the disease, patients and doctors alike, but there doesn't seem to be a noble path to dying.
Dying is seen as failing, and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together, but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.
So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye, and maybe our new story will be about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.
Terence loved poetry, and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets.
So I'll give you a couple lines from him.
This is a poem about Mark Antony.
You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero, Cleopatra's guy?
Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys.
And he's been a pretty good general.
He's won all the fights, he's eluded all the people that are out to get him, and yet this time, finally, he's come to the city of Alexandria and realized he's lost.
The people are leaving. They're playing instruments.
They're singing.
And suddenly he knows he's been defeated.
And he suddenly knows he's been deserted by the gods, and it's time to let go.
And the poet tells him what to do.
He tells him how to say a noble goodbye, a goodbye that's fit for a hero.
"As if long-prepared, as if courageous, as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city, approach the window with a firm step, and with emotion, but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward, as a last enjoyment, listen to the sounds, the exquisite instruments of the musical troops, and bid her farewell, the Alexandria you are losing."
That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life, a goodbye for a man for whom anything, well, almost anything, was possible, a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.
And isn't that what we're missing?
How can we learn that people's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly, powerfully, many times irrationally, on the slimmest of hopes?
The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial.
It's part of our DNA as humans, and maybe it's time our healthcare system -- doctors, patients, insurance companies, us, started accounting for the power of that hope.
Hope isn't a bug.
It's a feature.
Thank you.

<keywords>culture,death,health care,life</keywords>

So here's the most important economic fact of our time.
We are living in an age of surging income inequality, particularly between those at the very top and everyone else.
This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K., but it's a global phenomenon.
It's happening in communist China, in formerly communist Russia, it's happening in India, in my own native Canada.
We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies like Sweden, Finland and Germany.
Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening.
In the 1970s, the One Percent accounted for about 10 percent of the national income in the United States.
Today, their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent.
But what's even more striking is what's happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution.
The 0.1 percent in the U.S.
today account for more than eight percent of the national income.
They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago.
Let me give you another number to put that in perspective, and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005 by Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.
Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth of the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population, 120 million people.
Now, as it happens, Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat, he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon, and he has his own favorite number.
Buffett likes to point out that in 1992, the combined wealth of the people on the Forbes 400 list -- and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans -- was 300 billion dollars.
Just think about it.
You didn't even need to be a billionaire to get on that list in 1992.
Well, today, that figure has more than quintupled to 1.7 trillion, and I probably don't need to tell you that we haven't seen anything similar happen to the middle class, whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased.
So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy, but we've been slow to notice it.
One of the reasons, I think, is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon.
Changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic.
Think about what happened, after all, to the poor frog.
But I think there's something else going on.
Talking about income inequality, even if you're not on the Forbes 400 list, can make us feel uncomfortable.
It feels less positive, less optimistic, to talk about how the pie is sliced than to think about how to make the pie bigger.
And if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list, talking about income distribution, and inevitably its cousin, income redistribution, can be downright threatening.
So we're living in the age of surging income inequality, especially at the top.
What's driving it, and what can we do about it?
One set of causes is political: lower taxes, deregulation, particularly of financial services, privatization, weaker legal protections for trade unions, all of these have contributed to more and more income going to the very, very top.
A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of "crony capitalism," political changes that benefit a group of well-connected insiders but don't actually do much good for the rest of us.
In practice, getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult.
Think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance, or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the Great Depression, or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies, including those whose motto might be "don't do evil," to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class.
But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice is really, really hard, at least intellectually, it's an easy problem.
After all, no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism.
Indeed, this is one of those rare issues that unites the left and the right.
A critique of crony capitalism is as central to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street.
But if crony capitalism is, intellectually at least, the easy part of the problem, things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality.
In and of themselves, these aren't too mysterious.
Globalization and the technology revolution, the twin economic transformations which are changing our lives and transforming the global economy, are also powering the rise of the super-rich.
Just think about it.
For the first time in history, if you are an energetic entrepreneur with a brilliant new idea or a fantastic new product, you have almost instant, almost frictionless access to a global market of more than a billion people.
As a result, if you are very, very smart and very, very lucky, you can get very, very rich very, very quickly.
The latest poster boy for this phenomenon is David Karp.
The 26-year-old founder of Tumblr recently sold his company to Yahoo for 1.1 billion dollars.
Think about that for a minute: 1.1 billion dollars, 26 years old.
It's easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields, like sports and entertainment.
We can all watch how a fantastic athlete or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills across the global economy as never before.
But today, that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy.
We have superstar technologists.
We have superstar bankers.
We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects.
There are superstar cooks and superstar farmers.
There are even, and this is my personal favorite example, superstar dentists, the most dazzling exemplar of whom is Bernard Touati, the Frenchman who ministers to the smiles of fellow superstars like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich or European-born American fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg.
But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization and the technology revolution are creating this global plutocracy, what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it.
And that's because, in contrast with crony capitalism, so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive.
Let's start with technology.
I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices.
I love the fact that they mean that whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk far beyond this auditorium.
I'm even more of a fan of globalization.
This is the transformation which has lifted hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people out of poverty and into the middle class, and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world, it's made many new products affordable -- who do you think built your iPhone? — and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper.
Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt.
So what's not to like?
Well, a few things.
One of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy can become crony plutocracy.
Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur who has successfully sold that idea or that product to the global billions and become a billionaire in the process.
It gets tempting at that point to use your economic nous to manipulate the rules of the global political economy in your own favor.
And that's no mere hypothetical example.
Think about Amazon, Apple, Google, Starbucks.
These are among the world's most admired, most beloved, most innovative companies.
They also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly.
And why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage?
Once you have the tremendous economic power that we're seeing at the very, very top of the income distribution and the political power that inevitably entails, it becomes tempting as well to start trying to change the rules of the game in your own favor.
Again, this is no mere hypothetical.
It's what the Russian oligarchs did in creating the sale-of-the-century privatization of Russia's natural resources.
It's one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the U.S. and the U.K.
A second thing that worries me is how easily meritocratic plutocracy can become aristocracy.
One way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks, and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy.
That's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children.
The middle class is spending more on schooling too, but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school and ends at Harvard, Stanford or MIT, the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned by the One Percent.
The result is something that economists Alan Krueger and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve.
As income inequality increases, social mobility decreases.
The plutocracy may be a meritocracy, but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race.
The third thing, and this is what worries me the most, is the extent to which those same largely positive forces which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy also happen to be hollowing out the middle class in Western industrialized economies.
Let's start with technology.
Those same forces that are creating billionaires are also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs.
When's the last time you used a travel agent?
And in contrast with the industrial revolution, the titans of our new economy aren't creating that many new jobs.
At its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands, Facebook fewer than 10,000.
The same is true of globalization.
For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets, it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed Western economies.
The terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity.
That's shown in what I consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time.
Since the late 1990s, increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases in wages and employment.
That means that our countries are getting richer, our companies are getting more efficient, but we're not creating more jobs and we're not paying people, as a whole, more.
One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this is to worry about structural unemployment.
What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario.
After all, in a totally free labor market, we could find jobs for pretty much everyone.
The dystopia that worries me is a universe in which a few geniuses invent Google and its ilk and the rest of us are employed giving them massages.
So when I get really depressed about all of this, I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution.
After all, for all its grim, satanic mills, it worked out pretty well, didn't it?
After all, all of us here are richer, healthier, taller -- well, there are a few exceptions — and live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century.
But it's important to remember that before we learned how to share the fruits of the Industrial Revolution with the broad swathes of society, we had to go through two depressions, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Long Depression of the 1870s, two world wars, communist revolutions in Russia and in China, and an era of tremendous social and political upheaval in the West.
We also, not coincidentally, went through an era of tremendous social and political inventions.
We created the modern welfare state.
We created public education.
We created public health care.
We created public pensions.
We created unions.
Today, we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the Industrial Revolution.
To be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats, we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change.
We need a new New Deal.

Thank you. It's really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager.
Today I want to talk to you about the future, but first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past.
My story starts way before I was born.
My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp.
And she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split.
And somehow -- we don't really know exactly the whole story -- but the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp.
My grandmother survived and married my grandfather.
They were living in Hungary, and my mother was born.
And when my mother was two years old, the Hungarian revolution was raging, and they decided to escape Hungary.
They got on a boat, and yet another divergence -- the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia.
They got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada.
So, to make a long story short, they came to Canada.
My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto, and at 44 she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother, but I carry on her name -- her exact name, Eva Vertes -- and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too.
I found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old.
My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon.
And I had never been a reader when I was young -- my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew; I tried all that -- and I just didn't like reading books.
And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called "The Hot Zone." It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus.
And something about it just kind of drew me towards it.
There was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover, and I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book, and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon to Big Sur, and to, actually, here where we are today, in Monterey, I read that book, and from when I was reading that book, I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine.
I wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book, who went into the jungles of Africa, went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was. So from that moment on, I read every medical book I could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much.
I was a passive observer of the medical world.
It wasn't until I entered high school that I thought, "Maybe now, you know -- being a big high school kid -- I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world."
I was 14, and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded.
But I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway?
And I got to go talk to one professor, Dr. Jacobs, who accepted me into the lab.
At that time, I was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology -- specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system.
So I started that, and worked in his lab for a year, and found the results that I guess you'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals -- that it really, really impaired the nervous system.
The spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way.
And from then I wanted to look not at impairment, but at prevention of impairment.
So that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's and tried to familiarize myself with the research, and at the same time when I was in the -- I was reading in the medical library one day, and I read this article about something called "purine derivatives."
And they seemed to have cell growth-promoting properties.
And being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought, "Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's which is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound -- purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth."
And so I thought, "Maybe if it can promote cell growth, it can inhibit cell death, too."
And so that's the project that I pursued for that year, and it's continuing now as well, and found that a specific purine derivative called "guanidine" had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent.
So I presented those results at the International Science Fair, which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life.
And there I was awarded "Best in the World in Medicine," which allowed me to get in, or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world.
And from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world, I wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that.
And I stumbled across something called "cancer stem cells."
And this is really what I want to talk to you about today -- about cancer.
At first when I heard of cancer stem cells, I didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells, and I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future -- the therapy of many diseases to come in the future, perhaps.
But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time, so how did the good and bad go together?
Last summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells.
And while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature, trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field.
And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell.
This fascinated me. The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it.
It seems that cancer is a direct result to injury.
If you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises.
If you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs.
And it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises.
Because what stem cells are -- they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue.
So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response.
And the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged, we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue.
But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response, but can't quite control it.
It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated.
So this really, really fascinated me.
And I really think that we can't think about cancer -- let alone any disease -- in such black-and-white terms.
If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation, we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it.
It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point.
We're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix.
Shouldn't we think about manipulation, rather than elimination?
If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate -- to become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue, whatever that cancer has been put there to do -- it would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer.
So, this really changed my view of looking at cancer.
And while I was reading all these articles about cancer, it seemed that the articles -- a lot of them -- focused on, you know, the genetics of breast cancer, and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer -- tracking the cancer through the body, tracing where it is, where it goes.
But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart, or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter.
And skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body, or over 50 percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought, "Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer -- at least not that I know of."
So, I looked further into it, found as many articles as I could, and it was amazing -- because it turned out that it was very rare.
Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer, but of metastases going to skeletal muscle.
And what metastases are is when the tumor -- when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is.
It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous.
If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it, or somehow -- you know, it's contained. It's very contained.
But once it starts moving throughout the body, that's when it becomes deadly.
So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles, but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle -- there seemed to be something here.
So these articles were saying, you know, "Skeletal -- metastasis to skeletal muscle -- is very rare."
But it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why.
So I decided to ask why. At first -- the first thing I did was I emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said, "Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle.
Is there a reason for this?" And a lot of the replies I got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue.
Meaning that you have muscle cells, but they're not dividing, so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack.
But then again, this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely.
And furthermore, that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer, and brain cells are also terminally differentiated.
So I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami.
And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers.
But I know that in science, once you get the answers, inevitably you're going to have more questions.
So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life.
Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle, there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle.
And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells.
Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels.
And you think, the more highways there are in a tissue, the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases.
So first of all I thought, you know, "Wouldn't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle?" And as well, cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis, which is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow.
Without angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful.
So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer.
And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy.
16 percent! Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle, but only .16 percent of actual metastases -- suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis, is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels.
We use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body -- our heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles.
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting, so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself.
Therefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue, it can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.
So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more, an angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow -- this could be a potential future therapy for cancer.
And another thing that's really interesting is that there's this whole -- the way tumors move throughout the body, it's a very complex system -- and there's something called the chemokine network.
And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants, and they're the stop and go signals for cancer.
So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors, and another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body -- will have the corresponding chemokines, and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it.
Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules?
And the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle -- there's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured, that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle.
And, furthermore, when skeletal muscle is injured, that's what causes chemokines -- these signals saying, "Cancer, you can come to me," the "go signs" for the tumors -- it causes them to highly express these chemokines.
So, there's so much interplay here.
I mean, there are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle.
But it seems like by investigating, by attacking cancer, by searching where cancer is not, there has got to be something -- there's got to be something -- that's making this tissue resistant to tumors.
And can we utilize -- can we take this property, this compound, this receptor, whatever it is that's controlling these anti-tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general?
Now, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer -- to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body -- is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called "MyoD."
And what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells. So this compound, MyoD, has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells.
So, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue, but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue, MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells?
Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells, and this is why it seems as if it is so rare.
It's not harmful; it has just repaired the muscle.
Muscle is constantly being used -- constantly being damaged.
If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way, cancer occurred -- I mean, everybody would have cancer almost.
And I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell, possibly because of all its use, has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury, to fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very, very smart, and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do.
It's different when a bacteria comes into the body -- that's a foreign object -- we want that out.
But when the body is actually initiating a process and we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is the right solution. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched, that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy.
If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating -- for example Alzheimer's, where the brain, the brain cells, die and we need to restore new brain cells, new functional brain cells -- what if we could, in the future, use cancer? A tumor -- put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells?
That's a very far-fetched idea, but I really believe that it may be possible.
These cells are so versatile, these cancer cells are so versatile -- we just have to manipulate them in the right way.
And again, some of these may be far-fetched, but I figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas, it's here at TED, so thank you very much.

I'm here to spread the word about the magnificence of spiders and how much we can learn from them.
Spiders are truly global citizens.
You can find spiders in nearly every terrestrial habitat.
This red dot marks the Great Basin of North America, and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators.
Here's one of our field sites, and just to give you a sense of perspective, this little blue smudge here, that's one of my collaborators.
This is a rugged and barren landscape, yet there are quite a few spiders here.
Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider grappling with a beetle.
Spiders are not just everywhere, but they're extremely diverse.
There are over 40,000 described species of spiders.
To put that number into perspective, here's a graph comparing the 40,000 species of spiders to the 400 species of primates.
There are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates.
Spiders are also extremely old.
On the bottom here, this is the geologic timescale, and the numbers on it indicate millions of years from the present, so the zero here, that would be today.
So what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost 380 million years.
To put that into perspective, this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees, a mere seven million years ago.
All spiders make silk at some point in their life.
Most spiders use copious amounts of silk, and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction.
Even fossil spiders can make silk, as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider.
So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years.
It doesn't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life.
Spiders use silk for many purposes, including the trailing safety dragline, wrapping eggs for reproduction, protective retreats and catching prey.
There are many kinds of spider silk.
For example, this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks.
When you look at this orb web, you're actually seeing many types of silk fibers.
The frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk, while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks: the filament and the sticky droplet.
How does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk?
To answer that, you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider.
So silk comes out of the spinnerets, and for those of us spider silk biologists, this is what we call the "business end" of the spider.
We spend long days ...
Hey! Don't laugh. That's my life.
We spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider.
And this is what we see.
You can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets, because each spinneret has many spigots on it.
Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot, and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider, what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside.
So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect an orb-web-weaving spider, and I hope you do, what you would find is a bounty of beautiful, translucent silk glands.
Inside each spider, there are hundreds of silk glands, sometimes thousands.
These can be grouped into seven categories.
They differ by size, shape, and sometimes even color.
In an orb-web-weaving spider, you can find seven types of silk glands, and what I have depicted here in this picture, let's start at the one o'clock position, there's tubuliform silk glands, which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac.
There's the aggregate and flagelliform silk glands which combine to make the sticky capture spiral of an orb web.
Pyriform silk glands make the attachment cement -- that's the silk that's used to adhere silk lines to a substrate.
There's also aciniform silk, which is used to wrap prey.
Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction.
And the most studied silk line of them all: major ampullate silk.
This is the silk that's used to make the frame and radii of an orb web, and also the safety trailing dragline.
But what, exactly, is spider silk?
Spider silk is almost entirely protein.
Nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family, so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family, so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk, and over the last 380 million years, that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged, specialized, over and over and over again, to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today.
There are several features that all these silks have in common. They all have a common design, such as they're all very long -- they're sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins.
They're very repetitive, and they're very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine.
To give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like, this is a dragline silk protein, it's just a portion of it, from the black widow spider.
This is the kind of sequence that I love looking at day and night.
So what you're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored in the glycines with green, and the alanines in red, and so you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's.
You can also see that there's a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again, so for example there's a lot of what we call polyalanines, or iterated A's, AAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY.
You can think of these short motifs that repeat over and over again as words, and these words occur in sentences.
So for example this would be one sentence, and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine, that repeats over and over and over again, and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule.
Silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences.
At the top of the screen, you're seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider.
It's short. And on the bottom, this is the repeat sequence for the egg case, or tubuliform silk protein, for the exact same spider. And you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are -- so this is sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family.
You can see that the repeat units differ in length. They also differ in sequence.
So I've colored in the glycines again in green, alanine in red, and the serines, the letter S, in purple. And you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red, and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple.
What silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences, these amino acid sequences, to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers.
Now, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body.
This makes testing spider silk really, really easy to do in the laboratory, because we're actually, you know, testing it in air that's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins.
So this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing, which is basically, you know, tugging on one end of the fiber, very amenable.
Here are stress-strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider.
So what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors.
Specifically, if you look on the vertical axis, that's stress. If you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers, you can see that there's a lot of variation, and in fact dragline, or major ampullate silk, is the strongest of these fibers.
We think that's because the dragline silk, which is used to make the frame and radii for a web, needs to be very strong.
On the other hand, if you were to look at strain -- this is how much a fiber can be extended -- if you look at the maximum value here, again, there's a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform, or the capture spiral filament.
In fact, this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length.
So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility.
In the case of the capture spiral, it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey.
If it wasn't able to stretch so much, then basically when an insect hit the web, it would just trampoline right off of it.
So if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk, an insect is very likely to just bounce right off. But by having really, really stretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey.
There's quite a bit of variation within the fibers that an individual spider can make.
We call that the tool kit of a spider.
That's what the spider has to interact with their environment.
But how about variation among spider species, so looking at one type of silk and looking at different species of spiders?
This is an area that's largely unexplored but here's a little bit of data I can show you.
This is the comparison of the toughness of the dragline spilk spun by 21 species of spiders.
Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders.
It's been hypothesized that orb-weaving spiders, like this argiope here, should have the toughest dragline silks because they must intercept flying prey.
What you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph, the higher the toughness.
The 21 species are indicated here by this phylogeny, this evolutionary tree, that shows their genetic relationships, and I've colored in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders.
If you look right here at the two red arrows, they point to the toughness values for the draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus.
These are the two species of spiders for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spider silk research has been to replicate their dragline silk proteins.
Yet, their draglines are not the toughest.
In fact, the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region, a non orb-web-weaving spider.
This is the dragline spun by scytodes, the spitting spider.
Scytodes doesn't use a web at all to catch prey. Instead, scytodes sort of lurks around and waits for prey to get close to it, and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect.
Think of hunting with silly string.
That's how scytodes forages.
We don't really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline, but it's unexpected results like this that make bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile.
It frees us from the constraints of our imagination.
Now I'm going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber, bombyx -- or domesticated silkworm silk -- wool, Kevlar, and carbon fibers.
And what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them.
It's the combination of strength, extensibility and toughness that makes spider silk so special, and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists, so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions.
And the strength, extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response, have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications, for example, as a component of artificial tendons, for serving as guides to regrow nerves, and for scaffolds for tissue growth.
Spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti-ballistic capabilities.
Silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today.
In addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks, personally, I find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself.
I love when I'm in the laboratory, a new spider silk sequence comes in.
That's just the best.
It's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me, and that's why I'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk.
The next time you see a spider web, please, pause and look a little closer.
You'll be seeing one of the most high-performance materials known to man.
To borrow from the writings of a spider named Charlotte, silk is terrific.
Thank you.

What is going on in this baby's mind?
If you'd asked people this 30 years ago, most people, including psychologists, would have said that this baby was irrational, illogical, egocentric -- that he couldn't take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect.
In the last 20 years, developmental science has completely overturned that picture.
So in some ways, we think that this baby's thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.
Let me give you just one example of this.
One thing that this baby could be thinking about, that could be going on in his mind, is trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other baby.
After all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling.
And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.
Anyone who's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get.
We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people.
Now the question is: How could we ask them?
Babies, after all, can't talk, and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks, what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that.
So how do we actually ask them the question?
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli.
What we did -- Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I -- was actually to give the babies two bowls of food: one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.
Now all of the babies, even in Berkley, like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.
But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl.
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't.
So half the time, she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli -- just like a baby and any other sane person.
But half the time, what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go, "Mmmmm, broccoli.
I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm."
And then she would take a little bit of the crackers, and she'd go, "Eww, yuck, crackers.
I tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck."
So she'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies.
And then she would simply put her hand out and say, "Can you give me some?"
So the question is: What would the baby give her, what they liked or what she liked?
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies, just barely walking and talking, would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers, but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.
On the other hand, 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli, like they couldn't figure this out.
But then after they stared for a long time, they would just give her the crackers, what they thought everybody must like.
So there are two really remarkable things about this.
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature, that we don't always want the same thing.
And what's more, they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted.
Even more remarkably though, the fact that 15 month-olds didn't do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep, profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old.
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought.
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that's actually demonstrated it.
The question you might ask though is: Why do children learn so much?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time?
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially, they seem pretty useless.
And actually in many ways, they're worse than useless, because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive.
But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies, it turns out that there's actually an answer.
If we look across many, many different species of animals, not just us primates, but also including other mammals, birds, even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats, it turns out that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are.
And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there.
On one side is a New Caledonian crow.
And crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth, are incredibly smart birds.
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.
And this is a bird on the cover of science who's learned how to use a tool to get food.
On the other hand, we have our friend the domestic chicken.
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps.
So they're very, very good at pecking for grain, and they're not much good at doing anything else.
Well it turns out that the babies, the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.
They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years, which is a really long time in the life of a bird.
Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months.
So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot.
There's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning.
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this?
Well some animals, like the chicken, seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well.
So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment.
Other creatures, like the crows, aren't very good at doing anything in particular, but they're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments.
And of course, we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal.
We're smarter, we're more flexible, we can learn more, we survive in more different environments, we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.
And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species.
My son is 23.
And at least until they're 23, we're still popping those worms into those little open mouths.
All right, why would we see this correlation?
Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy, is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world, but it has one big disadvantage.
And that one big disadvantage is that, until you actually do all that learning, you're going to be helpless.
So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself, "A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better?"
You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up.
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor.
So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected.
We don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn.
And then as adults, we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.
So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species.
So they're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas, and we're production and marketing.
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use.
Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups, we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species -- kind of like caterpillars and butterflies -- except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring, and we're the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path.
If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn -- and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning, that's what they're for -- we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms.
And in fact, the baby's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet.
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better.
And there's been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently.
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy, the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.
And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize, describe, the way that scientists find out about the world.
So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with.
They go out and test it against the evidence.
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis.
Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth.
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.
And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now.
And some 10 years ago, I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.
So if you want to know what's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes, I think it actually looks something like this.
This is Reverend Bayes's notebook.
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they're revising to figure out how the world works.
All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate.
Because after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics, they look extremely stupid.
How could it be that children are doing statistics?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector.
This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others.
And using this very simple machine, my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world.
Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner, my student.
If I showed you this detector, you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector.
But actually, this detector works in a bit of a strange way.
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector, something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with, the detector will actually activate two out of three times.
Whereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector, it will only activate two out of six times.
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence.
It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy.
So we did just this; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence, and we just asked them to make it go.
And sure enough, the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector.
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.
The first one is, again, remember, these are four year-olds.
They're just learning how to count.
But unconsciously, they're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure.
And the other interesting thing is that they're using that evidence to get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world, that seems very unlikely to begin with.
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies, we've show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task.
So in these circumstances, the children are using statistics to find out about the world, but after all, scientists also do experiments, and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.
When children do experiments we call it "getting into everything" or else "playing."
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program.
Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab.
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.
And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't, and then she showed them an anomaly.
And what you'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes.
Boy: How about this?
Same as the other side.
Alison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified.
Boy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing.
AG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.
Boy: What's making this light up.
I don't know.
AG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair.
Boy: Oh, it's because this needs to be like this, and this needs to be like this.
AG: Okay, hypothesis two.
Boy: That's why.
Oh.
AG: Now this is his next idea.
He told the experimenter to do this, to try putting it out onto the other location.
Not working either.
Boy: Oh, because the light goes only to here, not here.
Oh, the bottom of this box has electricity in here, but this doesn't have electricity.
AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis.
Boy: It's lighting up.
So when you put four.
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up.
AG: Okay,there's his fifth hypothesis.
Now that is a particularly -- that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy, but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical.
If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something, what they really do is do a series of experiments.
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds.
Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?
What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes?
Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers, a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all.
And I think just the opposite is true.
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.
Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.
And adults' attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight.
So what happens for adults is we decide that something's relevant or important, we should pay attention to it.
Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid, and everything else sort of goes dark.
And we even know something about the way the brain does this.
So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains, sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible, more plastic, better at learning, and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains.
So we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.
If we look at babies and young children, we see something very different.
I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness.
So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing.
But they're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once.
And if you actually look in their brains, you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity, and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet.
So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention, what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.
So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that's important.
That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness, that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn.
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults, I think the best thing is think about cases where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before -- when we fall in love with someone new, or when we're in a new city for the first time.
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts, it expands, so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home.
And by the way, that coffee, that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs, actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters.
So what's it like to be a baby?
It's like being in love in Paris for the first time after you've had three double-espressos.
That's a fantastic way to be, but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning.
Now it's good to be a grownup.
I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.
It's good to be a grownup.
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves.
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do.
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies, to have open-mindedness, open learning, imagination, creativity, innovation, maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children.

The career that I started early on in my life was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places, and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic, and high deserts and low deserts.
Until about a dozen years ago, when I was really captured by caves, and I really re-focused most of my research in that direction.
So I have a really cool day job-- I get to do some really amazing stuff.
I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet.
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them, but nevertheless, they're absolutely gripping, and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very, very different from those that we have on the planet.
Apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there, we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets.
Particularly Mars, but also Europa, the small, icy moon around Jupiter.
And perhaps, someday, far beyond our solar system itself.
I'm very passionately interested in the human future, on the Moon and Mars particularly, and elsewhere in the solar system.
I think it's time that we transitioned to a solar system-going civilization and species.
And, as an outgrowth of all of this then, I wonder about whether we can, and whether we even should, think about transporting Earth-type life to other planets.
Notably Mars, as a first example.
Something I never talk about in scientific meetings is how I actually got to this state and why I do the work that I do.
Why don't I have a normal job, a sensible job?
And then of course, I blame the Soviet Union.
Because in the mid-1950s, when I was a tiny child, they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik, which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin.
And a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids.
And I'm a product of that generation, like so many other of my peers.
It really caught hold of us, and caught fire, and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now.
Of course, refusing to grow up -- -- even though I impersonate a grown-up in daily life, but I do a fairly good job of that -- but really retaining that childlike quality of not caring what other people think about what you're interested in, is really critical.
The next element is the fact that I have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life.
And so, life is more valuable than no life.
And so I think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach.
I'm very interested in Mars, of course, and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate when the Viking Landers landed on Mars.
And that took what had been a tiny little astronomical object in the sky, that you would see as a dot, and turned it completely into a landscape, as that very first primitive picture came rastering across the screen.
And when it became a landscape, it also became a destination, and altered, really, the course of my life.
In my graduate years I worked with my colleague and mentor and friend, Steve Schneider, at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, working on global change issues.
We've written a number of things on the role of Gaia hypothesis -- whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity in any meaningful scientific sense, and then, as an outgrowth of that, I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war.
So, wonderful things and grim things.
But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet with external eyes, not just as our home.
And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective, to try to then think about the way our planet behaves, as a planet, and with the life that's on it.
And all of this seems to me to be a salient point in history.
We're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond.
So, back to Mars.
How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars?
Well, sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other, even on this planet.
So, finding life on another planet is a non-trivial occupation and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that.
Whether or not you think it's likely to be successful sort of depends on what you think about the chances of life in the universe.
I think, myself, that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time.
So, you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen, and then you get helium, and then you get more complicated stuff, and you get planets forming -- and life is a common, planetary-based phenomenon, in my view.
Certainly, in the last 15 years, we've seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed, and just last month, a couple of weeks ago, a planet in the size-class of Earth has actually been found.
And so this is very exciting news.
So, my first bold prediction is that, is that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere.
It's going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it.
And those planetary systems are going to be very common.
So, what about life on Mars?
Well, if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be, I would've probably said, a couple of percent.
And even that was considered outrageous at the time.
I was once sneeringly introduced by a former NASA official, as the only person on the planet who still thought there was life on Mars.
Of course, that official is now dead, and I'm not, so there's a certain amount of glory in outliving your adversaries.
But things have changed greatly over the last dozen years.
And the reason that they have changed is because we now have new information.
The amazing Pathfinder mission that went in '97, and the MER Rover missions that are on Mars as we speak now and the European Space Agency's Mars Express, has taught us a number of amazing things.
There is sub-surface ice on that planet.
And so where there is water, there is a very high chance of our kind of life.
There's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place – one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed, and there are these amazing structures called blueberries, which are these little, rocky concretions that we are busy making biologically in my lab right now.
So, with all of these things put together, I think that the chances of life are much greater than I would've ever thought.
I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars, sometime in its past, is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half.
So this is a very bold statement.
I think it's there, and I think we need to go look for it, and I think it's underground.
So the game's afoot, and this is the game that we play in astro-biology.
How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life?
How do you plan to look for it?
How do you know it when you find it?
Because if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it -- it would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't.
So, we know that it's probably quite cryptic.
Very critically, how do we protect it, if we find it, and not contaminate it?
And also, even perhaps more critically, because this is the only home planet we have, how do we protect us from it, while we study it?
So why might it be hard to find?
Well, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy to study microscopic things, although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater depth, at much smaller scales than ever before.
But it's probably hiding, because if you are out sequestering resources from your environment, that makes you yummy, and other things might want to eat you, or consume you.
And so, there's a game of predator-prey that's going to be, essentially, universal, really, in any kind of biological system.
It also may be very, very different in its fundamental properties – its chemistry, or its size.
We say small, but what does that mean?
Is it virus-sized? Is it smaller than that?
Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium? We don't know.
And speed of activity, which is something that we face in our work with sub-surface organisms, because they grow very, very slowly.
If I were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a Petri plate, within about four or five hours, I would have to see growth.
But the organisms that we work with, from the sub-surface of Earth, very often it's months -- and in many cases, years -- before we see any growth whatsoever.
So they are, intrinsically, a slower life-form.
But the real issue is that we are guided by our limited experience, and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know, then we can't recognize what to look for, or how to plan for it.
So, perspective is everything and, because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about, I have learned to think about Earth as an extraterrestrial planet.
And this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things.
This is my favorite game on airplanes: where you're in an airplane and you look out the window, you see the horizon.
I always turn my head on the side, and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home, to seeing it as a planet.
It's a very simple trick, and I never fail to do it when I'm sitting in a window seat.
Well, this is what we apply to our work.
This shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in.
This is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco, in Mexico, and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid.
There is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide coming into this cave from volcanic sources and from the breakdown of evaporite -- minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed -- and it is a completely hostile environment for us.
We have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear, and 30 parts per million of H2S will kill you.
This is regularly several hundred parts per million.
So, it's a very hazardous environment, with CO as well, and many other gases.
These extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special.
Because contrary to what you might think, this is not devoid of life.
This is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet, anywhere.
It's bursting with life.
The extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right, but one of the reasons that we're interested in them is because they represent, really, the average conditions that we may expect on other planets.
So, this is part of the ability that we have, to try to stretch our imagination, in terms of what we may find in the future.
There's so much life in this cave, and I can't even begin to scratch the surface of it with you.
But one of the most famous objects out of this are what we call Snottites, for obvious reasons.
This stuff looks like what comes out of your two-year-old's nose when he has a cold.
And this is produced by bacteria who are actually making more sulfuric acid, and living at pHs right around zero.
And so, this stuff is like battery acid.
And yet, everything in this cave has adapted to it.
In fact, there's so much energy available for biology in this cave, that there's actually a huge number of cavefish.
And the local Zoque Indians harvest this twice a year, as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration.
This is very unusual for caves.
In some of the other amazing caves that we work in -- this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad, and this is one of the most famous caves in the world.
It's 115 miles of mapped passage, it's pristine, it has no natural opening and it's a gigantic biological, geo-microbiological laboratory.
In this cave, great areas are covered by this reddish material that you see here, and also these enormous crystals of selenite that you can see dangling down.
This stuff is produced biologically.
This is the breakdown product of the bedrock, that organisms are busy munching their way through.
They take iron and manganese minerals within the bedrock and they oxidize them.
And every time they do that, they get a tiny little packet of energy.
And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use, then, to run their life processes.
Interestingly enough, they also do this with uranium and chromium, and various other toxic metals.
And so, the obvious avenue for bio-remediation comes from organisms like this.
These organisms we now bring into the lab, and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates, and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves.
So, these are signals that they leave in the rock record.
Well, even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves, which are a by-product of volcanic activity, we find these walls totally covered, in many cases, by these beautiful, glistening silver walls, or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold.
And these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria.
And you can see in these central images here, scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys -- these are gardens of these bacteria.
One of the interesting things about these particular guys is that they're in the actinomycete and streptomycete groups of the bacteria, which is where we get most of our antibiotics.
The sub-surface of Earth contains a vast biodiversity.
And these organisms, because they're very separate from the surface, make a vast array of novel compounds.
And so, the potential for exploiting this for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses is completely untapped, but probably exceeds most of the rest of the biodiversity of the planet.
So, lava-tube caves-- I've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet.
We know that on Mars and the Moon there are tons of these structures.
We can see them.
On the left you can see a lava tube forming at a recent eruption -- Mount Etna in Sicily -- and this is the way these tubes form.
And when they hollow out, then they become habitats for organisms.
These are all over the planet Mars, and we're busy cataloguing them now.
And so, there's very interesting cave real estate on Mars, at least of that type.
In order to access these sub-surface environments that we're interested in, we're very interested in developing the tools to do this.
You know, it's not easy to get into these caves.
It requires crawling, climbing, rope-work, technical rope-work and many other complex human motions in order to access these.
We face the problem of, how can we do this robotically?
Why would we want to do it robotically?
Well, we're going to be sending robotic missions to Mars long in advance of human missions.
And then, secondly, getting back to that earlier point that I made about the preciousness of any life that we may find on Mars, we don't want to contaminate it.
And one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it is to have an intermediary.
And in this case, we're imagining intermediary robotic devices that can actually do some of that front-end work for us, to protect any potential life that we find.
I'm not going to go through all of these projects now, but we're involved in about half-a-dozen robotic development projects, in collaboration with a number of different groups.
I want to talk specifically about the array that you see on the top.
These are hopping microbot swarms.
I'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT, and we have come up with the idea of having little, jumping bean-like robots that are propelled by artificial muscle, which is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties -- are the EPAMs, or artificial muscles.
And these allow them to hop.
They behave with a swarm behavior, where they relate to each other, modeled after insect swarm behavior, and they could be made very numerous.
And so, one can send a thousand of them, as you can see in this upper left-hand picture, a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current MER Rovers.
And these little guys -- you could lose many of them.
If you send a thousand of them, you could probably get rid of 90 percent of them and still have a mission.
And so, that allows you the flexibility to go into very challenging terrain and actually make your way where you want to go.
Now, to wrap this up, I want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves.
It occurred to us a number of years ago that caves have many properties that people have used and other organisms have used as habitat in the past.
And perhaps it's time we started to explore those, in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration.
So, we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study, looking at the irreducible set of technologies that you would need in order to actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes on the Moon or Mars.
It turns out to be a fairly simple and small list, and we have gone in the relatively primitive technology direction.
So, we're talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave, foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology, various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies.
And the future is there for us to use these lava-tube caves on Mars.
And right now we're in caves, and we're doing science and recreation, but I think in the future we'll be using them for habitat and science on these other bodies.
Now, my view of what the current status of potential life on Mars is that it's probably been on the planet, maybe one in two chances.
The question as to whether there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth has now been very muddied, because we now know, from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth, that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets.
One of the burning questions, of course, is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface, as I fully expect that we will, is that a second genesis of life?
Did life start here and was it transported there?
Did it start there and get transported here?
This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century, and where I expect that we will have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions.
Thank you.

I'm Ellen, and I'm totally obsessed with food.
But I didn't start out obsessed with food.
I started out obsessed with global security policy because I lived in New York during 9/11, and it was obviously a very relevant thing.
And I got from global security policy to food because I realized when I'm hungry, I'm really pissed off, and I'm assuming that the rest of the world is too.
Especially if you're hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor's kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry, you're pretty angry.
And actually, lo and behold, it looks pretty much like the areas of the world that are hungry are also the areas of the world that are pretty insecure.
So I took a job at the United Nations World Food Programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues.
And while I was there, I came across what I think is the most brilliant of their programs.
It's called School Feeding, and it's a really simple idea to sort of get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger that continues for a lot of people around the world, and stop it.
By giving kids a free school meal, it gets them into school, which is obviously education, the first step out of poverty, but it also gives them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need to really develop both mentally and physically.
While I was working at the U.N., I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush.
And she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag called the "Feed Bag" -- which is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the Feed Bag.
But each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid.
It's so simple, and we thought, you know, okay, it costs between 20 and 50 bucks to provide school feeding for a year.
We could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and a ton of awareness for the World Food Programme.
But of course, you know at the U.N., sometimes things move slowly, and they basically said no.
And we thought, God, this is such a good idea and it's going to raise so much money.
So we said screw it, we'll just start our own company, which we did three years ago.
So that was kind of my first dream, was to start this company called FEED, and here's a screenshot of our website.
We did this bag for Haiti, and we launched it just a month after the earthquake to provide school meals for kids in Haiti.
So FEED's doing great. We've so far provided 55 million meals to kids around the world by selling now 550,000 bags, a ton of bags, a lot of bags.
All this time you're -- when you think about hunger, it's a hard thing to think about, because what we think about is eating.
I think about eating a lot, and I really love it.
And the thing that's a little strange about international hunger and talking about international issues is that most people kind of want to know: "What are you doing in America?"
"What are you doing for America's kids?"
There's definitely hunger in America: 49 million people and almost 16.7 million children.
I mean that's pretty dramatic for our own country.
Hunger definitely means something a little bit different in America than it does internationally, but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country.
But obviously the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity, and it's dramatic.
The other thing that's dramatic is that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last 30 years.
Unfortunately, obesity's not only an American problem.
It's actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that we're exporting.
The numbers are pretty crazy.
There's a billion people obese or overweight and a billion people hungry.
So those seem like two bifurcated problems, but I kind of started to think about, you know, what is obesity and hunger? What are both those things about?
Well, they're both about food.
And when you think about food, the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture.
And agriculture is where food comes from.
Well, agriculture in America's very interesting.
It's very consolidated, and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat.
Well, the foods that are produced are, more or less, corn, soy and wheat.
And as you can see, that's three-quarters of the food that we're eating for the most part: processed foods and fast foods.
Unfortunately, in our agricultural system, we haven't done a good job in the last three decades of exporting those technologies around the world.
So African agriculture, which is the place of most hunger in the world, has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen.
So somehow we're not making the connect between exporting a good agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world.
Who is farming them? That's what I was wondering.
So I went and stood on a big grain bin in the Midwest, and that really didn't help me understand farming, but I think it's a really cool picture.
And you know, the reality is that between farmers in America, who actually, quite frankly, when I spend time in the Midwest, are pretty large in general.
And their farms are also large.
But farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny, and that's because they're starving.
Most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers.
And most of those people are women -- which is a totally other topic that I won't get on right now, but I'd love to do the feminist thing at some point.
I think it's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides.
There's this large, consolidated farming that's led to what we eat in America, and it's really been since around 1980, after the oil crisis, when, you know, mass consolidation, mass exodus of small farmers in this country.
And then in the same time period, you know, we've kind of left Africa's farmers to do their own thing.
Unfortunately, what is farmed ends up as what we eat.
And in America, a lot of what we eat has led to obesity and has led to a real change in sort of what our diet is in the last 30 years.
It's crazy.
A fifth of kids under two drinks soda.
Hello. You don't put soda in bottles.
But people do because it's so cheap, and so our whole food system in the last 30 years has really shifted.
I think, you know, it's not just in our own country, but really we're exporting the system around the world, and when you look at the data of least developed countries -- especially in cities, which are growing really rapidly -- people are eating American processed foods.
And in one generation, they're going from hunger, and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger, to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation.
So the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity.
Not to beat a dead horse, but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese.
I think that's the only way to look at it.
And instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate, it's really important to look at them as one system.
We get a lot of our food from all around the world, and people from all around the world are importing our food system, so it's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it.
The thing is, I've learned -- and the technology people that are here, which I'm totally not one of them -- but apparently, it really takes 30 years for a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us, like the mouse and the Internet and Windows.
You know, there's 30-year cycles.
I think 2010 can be a really interesting year because it is the end of the 30-year cycle, and it's the birthday of the global food system.
So that's the first birthday I want to talk about.
You know, I think if we really think that this is something that's happened in the last 30 years, there's hope in that.
It's the thirtieth anniversary of GMO crops and the Big Gulp, Chicken McNuggets, high fructose corn syrup, the farm crisis in America and the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally.
So there's a lot of reasons to take this 30-year time period as sort of the creation of this new food system.
I'm not the only one who's obsessed with this whole 30-year thing.
The icons like Michael Pollan and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish both addressed this last three-decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change.
Well, I really care about 1980 because it's also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year.
And so in my lifetime, a lot of what's happened in the world -- and being a person obsessed with food -- a lot of this has really changed.
So my second dream is that I think we can look to the next 30 years as a time to change the food system again.
And we know what's happened in the past, so if we start now, and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term, we might be able to recreate the food system so when I give my next talk and I'm 60 years old, I'll be able to say that it's been a success.
So I'm announcing today the start of a new organization, or a new fund within the FEED Foundation, called the 30 Project.
And the 30 Project is really focused on these long-term ideas for food system change.
And I think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity, we might actually look for long-term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone.
We all tend to think that these systems are quite different, and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world, but if we take a 30-year view, there's more hope in collaborative ideas.
So I'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the ONE campaign and Slow Food, which don't seem right now to have much in common, we can talk about holistic, long-term, systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone.
Some ideas I've had is like, look, the reality is -- kids in the South Bronx need apples and carrots and so do kids in Botswana.
And how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods?
Another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish.
Understanding how to produce protein in a way that's healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers.
And you know, these are really relevant topics that are long term and important for both people in Africa who are small farmers and people in America who are farmers and eaters.
And I also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way, where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips.
Well, if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple, then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn, soy and wheat.
The 30Project.org is launched, and I've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start.
And it'll be growing over the next few months.
But I really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long term at things like the food system and make change.

<title>Ellen Gustafson: Obesity + Hunger = 1 global food issue</title>
<description>Co-creator of the philanthropic FEED bags, Ellen Gustafson says hunger and obesity are two sides of the same coin. In her talk, she launches The 30 Project -- a way to change how we farm and eat in the next 30 years, and solve the global food inequalities behind both epidemics. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>
<keywords>food,global issues,health,social change</keywords>

Please close your eyes, and open your hands.
Now imagine what you could place in your hands: an apple, maybe your wallet.
Now open your eyes.
What about a life?
What you see here is a premature baby.
He looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive because he can't regulate his own body temperature.
This baby is so tiny he doesn't have enough fat on his body to stay warm.
Sadly, 20 million babies like this are born every year around the world.
Four million of these babies die annually.
But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe, long-term health problems.
The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life, its only job is to grow.
If it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally, resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes, to heart disease, to low I.Q.
Imagine: Many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm.
That is the primary function of an incubator.
But traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to 20 thousand dollars.
So, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries.
As a result, parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies, or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here -- methods that are both ineffective and unsafe.
I've seen this firsthand over and over again.
On one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha, who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani.
She took her baby to the nearest village clinic, and the doctor advised her to take Rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator.
But that hospital was over four hours away, and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there, so her baby died.
Inspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this, my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution, something that could work without electricity, that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use, given that the majority of births still take place in the home.
We needed something that was portable, something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra-low-cost, compared to the 20,000 dollars that an incubator in the U.S. costs.
So, this is what we came up with.
What you see here looks nothing like an incubator.
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby.
You can open it up completely. It's waterproof.
There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily.
But the magic is in this pouch of wax.
This is a phase-change material.
It's a wax-like substance with a melting point of human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius.
You can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time, after which you simply reheat the pouch.
So, you then place it into this little pocket back here, and it creates a warm micro-environment for the baby.
Looks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities.
We plan to launch this product in India in 2010, and the target price point will be 25 dollars, less than 0.1 percent of the cost of a traditional incubator.
Over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies.
But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth.
This seems counterintuitive, but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced, population sizes also decrease, because parents don't need to anticipate that their babies are going to die.
We hope that the Embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology: simple, localized, affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact.
In designing this we followed a few basic principles.
We really tried to understand the end user, in this case, people like Sevitha.
We tried to understand the root of the problem rather than being biased by what already exists.
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem.
In doing this, I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses.
And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace.

Hello, everyone. Because this is my first time at TED, I've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit.
Yes. That's right. This is Barbie.
She's 50 years old. And she's looking as young as ever.
But I'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face.
This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie.
Now, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations, Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres.
They have different interests. They have divergent values.
And should they ever come in contact ...
well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty.
My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different.
Where I work, in the Arab region, people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally Western, nor are they traditionally Islamic.
I want to show you two examples.
The first is 4Shbab.
It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel.
: Video clips from across the globe.
The USA.
I am not afraid to stand alone I am not afraid to stand alone, if Allah is by my side I am not afraid to stand alone Everything will be all right I am not afraid to stand alone The Arab world.
She was preserved by modesty of the religion She was adorned by the light of the Quran Shereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV.
Its creator, who is an Egyptian TV producer called Ahmed Abu Haïba, wants young people to be inspired by Islam to lead better lives.
He reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.
4Shbab was set up as an alternative to existing Arab music channels.
And they look something like this.
That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star and pan-Arab pin-up girl.
In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind.
But it's not about fire and brimstone either.
Its videos are intended to show a kinder, gentler face of Islam, for young people to deal with life's challenges.
Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd.
And it's called "The 99."
Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes.
They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa.
And his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance, all in a child-friendly format.
"The 99." The characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah: justice, wisdom, mercy, among others.
So, for example, there is the character of Noora.
She is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone.
Another character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions.
Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book.
It's now a theme park.
There is an animated series in the works.
And by this time next year, the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with "The 99" to beat injustice wherever they find it.
"The 99" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization.
We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations.
Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.
I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations, in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined.
Now, while 4Shbab and "The 99" may look new and shiny, there is actually a very long tradition of this.
Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern.
After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this: "We made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another."
And to my mind, those are pretty wise words, no matter what your creed. Thank you.

So, why does good sex so often fade, even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever?
And why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex, contrary to popular belief?
Or, the next question would be, can we want what we already have?
That's the million-dollar question, right?
And why is the forbidden so erotic?
What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent?
And why does sex make babies, and babies spell erotic disaster in couples?
It's kind of the fatal erotic blow, isn't it?
And when you love, how does it feel?
And when you desire, how is it different?
These are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love.
So I travel the globe, and what I'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered, there seems to be a crisis of desire.
A crisis of desire, as in owning the wanting -- desire as an expression of our individuality, of our free choice, of our preferences, of our identity -- desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies.
You know, this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term, not because we want 14 children, for which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it, and not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty.
This is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire.
So what sustains desire, and why is it so difficult?
And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship, I think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs.
On the one hand, our need for security, for predictability, for safety, for dependability, for reliability, for permanence -- all these anchoring, grounding experiences of our lives that we call home.
But we also have an equally strong need -- men and women -- for adventure, for novelty, for mystery, for risk, for danger, for the unknown, for the unexpected, surprise -- you get the gist -- for journey, for travel.
So reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship, or what we today like to call a passionate marriage, used to be a contradiction in terms.
Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship.
But now we want our partner to still give us all these things, but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot, and we live twice as long.
So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide: Give me belonging, give me identity, give me continuity, but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one.
Give me comfort, give me edge.
Give me novelty, give me familiarity.
Give me predictability, give me surprise.
And we think it's a given, and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that.
So now we get to the existential reality of the story, right?
Because I think, in some way -- and I'll come back to that -- but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination.
So why does good sex so often fade?
What is the relationship between love and desire?
How do they relate, and how do they conflict?
Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism.
So if there is a verb, for me, that comes with love, it's "to have."
And if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is "to want."
In love, we want to have, we want to know the beloved.
We want to minimize the distance. We want to contract that gap.
We want to neutralize the tensions. We want closeness.
But in desire, we tend to not really want to go back to the places we've already gone.
Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest.
In desire, we want an Other, somebody on the other side that we can go visit, that we can go spend some time with, that we can go see what goes on in their red light district.
In desire, we want a bridge to cross.
Or in other words, I sometimes say, fire needs air.
Desire needs space.
And when it's said like that, it's often quite abstract.
But then I took a question with me.
And I've gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years with "Mating in Captivity," and I asked people, when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner?
Not attracted sexually, per se, but most drawn.
And across culture, across religion, and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back.
So the first group is: I am most drawn to my partner when she is away, when we are apart, when we reunite.
Basically, when I get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner, when my imagination comes back in the picture, and when I can root it in absence and in longing, which is a major component of desire.
But then the second group is even more interesting: I am most drawn to my partner when I see him in the studio, when she is onstage, when he is in his element, when she's doing something she's passionate about, when I see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him, when I see her hold court.
Basically, when I look at my partner radiant and confident, probably the biggest turn-on across the board.
Radiant, as in self-sustaining.
I look at this person -- by the way, in desire people rarely talk about it, when we are blended into one, five centimeters from each other. I don't know in inches how much that is.
But it's also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them.
It's when I'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance, where this person that is already so familiar, so known, is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.
And in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan, lies that movement toward the other.
Because sometimes, as Proust says, mystery is not about traveling to new places, but it's about looking with new eyes.
And so, when I see my partner on his own or her own, doing something in which they are enveloped, I look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception, and I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me.
And then, more importantly, in this description about the other or myself -- it's the same -- what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire.
Nobody needs anybody.
There is no caretaking in desire.
Caretaking is mightily loving. It's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac.
I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them.
Wanting them is one thing. Needing them is a shutdown, and women have known that forever, because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge.
For good reasons, right?
And then the third group of answers usually would be when I'm surprised, when we laugh together, as somebody said to me in the office today, when he's in his tux, so I said, you know, it's either the tux or the cowboy boots.
But basically it's when there is novelty.
But novelty isn't about new positions. It isn't a repertoire of techniques.
Novelty is, what parts of you do you bring out?
What parts of you are just being seen?
Because in some way one could say sex isn't something you do, eh?
Sex is a place you go. It's a space you enter inside yourself and with another, or others.
So where do you go in sex?
What parts of you do you connect to?
What do you seek to express there?
Is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union?
Is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive?
Is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything?
Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes?
What comes out there? It's a language.
It isn't just a behavior.
And it's the poetic of that language that I'm interested in, which is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence.
You know, animals have sex.
It's the pivot, it's biology, it's the natural instinct.
We are the only ones who have an erotic life, which means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination.
We are the only ones who can make love for hours, have a blissful time, multiple orgasms, and touch nobody, just because we can imagine it.
We can hint at it. We don't even have to do it.
We can experience that powerful thing called anticipation, which is a mortar to desire, the ability to imagine it, as if it's happening, to experience it as if it's happening, while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time.
So when I began to think about eroticism, I began to think about the poetics of sex, and if I look at it as an intelligence, then it's something that you cultivate.
What are the ingredients? Imagination, playfulness, novelty, curiosity, mystery.
But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination.
But more importantly, for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark, what sustains desire, I had to go back to the original definition of eroticism, the mystical definition, and I went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma, which is the other side, and I looked at it looking at the community that I had grown up in, which was a community in Belgium, all Holocaust survivors, and in my community there were two groups: those who didn't die, and those who came back to life.
And those who didn't die lived often very tethered to the ground, could not experience pleasure, could not trust, because when you're vigilant, worried, anxious, and insecure, you can't lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative.
Those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death.
They knew how to keep themselves alive.
And when I began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that I work with, I sometimes would hear people say, "I want more sex," but generally people want better sex, and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness, of vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality, of eros, of energy that sex used to afford them, or that they've hoped it would afford them.
And so I began to ask a different question.
"I shut myself off when ..." began to be the question.
"I turn off my desires when ..." which is not the same question as, "What turns me of is ..." and "You turn me off when ..."
And people began to say, "I turn myself off when I feel dead inside, when I don't like my body, when I feel old, when I haven't had time for myself, when I haven't had a chance to even check in with you, when I don't perform well at work, when I feel low self esteem, when I don't have a sense of self-worth, when I don't feel like I have a right to want, to take, to receive pleasure."
And then I began to ask the reverse question.
"I turn myself on when ..." Because most of the time, people like to ask the question, "You turn me on, what turns me on," and I'm out of the question. You know?
Now, if you are dead inside, the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine's.
It won't make a dent. There is nobody at the reception desk.
So I turn myself on when, I turn my desires, I wake up when ...
Now, in this paradox between love and desire, what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love -- mutuality, reciprocity, protection, worry, responsibility for the other -- are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire.
Because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love: jealousy, possessiveness, aggression, power, dominance, naughtiness, mischief.
Basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day.
You know, the erotic mind is not very politically correct.
If everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses, we wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this.
But no, in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don't always know how to bring to the person that we love, because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word: the ability to stay connected to one's self in the presence of another.
So I want to draw that little image for you, because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs, we are born with that.
Our need for connection, our need for separateness, or our need for security and adventure, or our need for togetherness and for autonomy, and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable, and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore.
That's the beginning of desire, that exploratory needs curiosity, discovery.
And then at some point they turn around and they look at you, and if you tell them, "Hey kiddo, the world's a great place. Go for it.
There's so much fun out there," then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time.
They can go off in their imagination, off in their body, off in their playfulness, all the while knowing that there's somebody when they come back.
But if on this side there is somebody who says, "I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed.
My partner hasn't taken care of me in so long.
What's so good out there? Don't we have everything you need together, you and I?"
then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize.
Some of us will come back, came back a long time ago, and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other.
I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection.
And I will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection, and I won't know how to leave you in order to go play, in order to go experience pleasure, in order to discover, to enter inside myself.
Translate this into adult language.
It starts very young. It continues into our sex lives up to the end.
Child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time.
"Are you going to be there?
Are you going to curse me? Are you going to scold me?
Are you going to be angry with me?"
And they may be gone, but they're never really away, and those are often the people that will tell you, in the beginning it was super hot.
Because in the beginning, the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire.
The more connected I became, the more responsible I felt, the less I was able to let go in your presence.
The third child doesn't really come back.
So what happens, if you want to sustain desire, it's that real dialectic piece.
On the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go.
On the other hand if you can't go, you can't have pleasure, you can't culminate, you don't have an orgasm, you don't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own.
So in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs, there are a few things that I've come to understand erotic couples do.
One, they have a lot of sexual privacy.
They understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them.
They also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing.
Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm.
They also understand that an erotic space isn't about, you begin to stroke the other.
It's about you create a space where you leave Management Inc., maybe where you leave the agile program, and you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible.
Responsibility and desire just butt heads.
They don't really do well together.
Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes.
It's pretty much like the moon. It has intermittent eclipses.
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it.
They know how to bring it back, and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth, which is the myth of spontaneity, which is that it's just going to fall from heaven while you're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina, and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship already has.
Committed sex is premeditated sex.
It's willful. It's intentional.
It's focus and presence.
Merry Valentine's.

<title>Esther Perel: The secret to desire in a long-term relationship</title>
<description>In long-term relationships, we often expect our beloved to be both best friend and erotic partner. But as Esther Perel argues, good &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; committed sex draws on two conflicting needs: our need for security and our need for surprise. So how do you sustain desire? With wit and eloquence, Perel lets us in on the mystery of erotic intelligence.</description>

"What I Will" I will not dance to your war drum.
I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum.
I will not dance to that beating.
I know that beat.
It is lifeless.
I know intimately that skin you are hitting.
It was alive once, hunted, stolen, stretched.
I will not dance to your drummed-up war.
I will not pop, spin, break for you.
I will not hate for you or even hate you.
I will not kill for you.
Especially I will not die for you.
I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide.
I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing.
Everyone can be wrong.
Life is a right, not collateral or casual.
I will not forget where I come from.
I will craft my own drum.
Gather my beloved near, and our chanting will be dancing.
Our humming will be drumming.
I will not be played.
I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat.
I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance.
This heartbeat is louder than death.
Your war drum ain't louder than this breath. Haaa.
What's up TED people? Let me hear you make some noise.
A bunch of pacifists.
Confused, aspiring pacifists.
I understand.
I've been wrong a lot lately.
Like a lot.
So I couldn't figure out what to read today.
I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping.
What that means is prepping my outfit, prepping options, trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of.
Poetry does that.
It preps you. It aims you.
So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now.
But I'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here.
Hold her now with you.
You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her.
Are you holding her?
This is "Break Clustered."
All holy history banned.
Unwritten books predicted the future, projected the past.
But my head unwraps around what appears limitless, man's creative violence.
Whose son shall it be?
Which male child will perish a new day?
Our boys' deaths galvanize.
We cherish corpses.
We mourn women, complicated.
Bitches get beat daily.
Profits made, prophets ignored.
War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods.
All colors run, none of us solid.
Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within.
I live cycles of light and darkness.
Rhythm is half silence.
I see now, I never was one and not the other.
Sickness, health, tender violence.
I think now I never was pure.
Before form I was storm, blind, ign'ant -- still am.
Human contracted itself blind, malignant.
I never was pure.
Girl spoiled before ripened.
Language can't math me.
I experience exponentially.
Everything is everything.
One woman loses 15, maybe 20, members of her family.
One woman loses six.
One woman loses her head.
One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash.
One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband.
One woman straps herself.
One woman gives birth to a baby.
One woman gives birth to borders.
One woman no longer believes love will ever find her.
One woman never did.
Where do refugee hearts go?
Broken, dissed, placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed.
Faced with absence.
We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all.
My spine curves spiral.
Precipice running to and running from human beings.
Cluster bombs left behind.
De facto landmines.
A smoldering grief.
Harvest contaminated tobacco.
Harvest bombs.
Harvest baby teeth.
Harvest palms, smoke.
Harvest witness, smoke.
Resolutions, smoke.
Salvation, smoke.
Redemption, smoke.
Breathe.
Do not fear what has blown up.
If you must, fear the unexploded.
Thank you.

In the northwest corner of the United States, right up near the Canadian border, there's a little town called Libby, Montana, and it's surrounded by pine trees and lakes and just amazing wildlife and these enormous trees that scream up into the sky.
And in there is a little town called Libby, which I visited, which feels kind of lonely, a little isolated.
And in Libby, Montana, there's a rather unusual woman named Gayla Benefield.
She always felt a little bit of an outsider, although she's been there almost all her life, a woman of Russian extraction.
She told me when she went to school, she was the only girl who ever chose to do mechanical drawing.
Later in life, she got a job going house to house reading utility meters -- gas meters, electricity meters.
And she was doing the work in the middle of the day, and one thing particularly caught her notice, which was, in the middle of the day she met a lot of men who were at home, middle aged, late middle aged, and a lot of them seemed to be on oxygen tanks.
It struck her as strange.
Then, a few years later, her father died at the age of 59, five days before he was due to receive his pension.
He'd been a miner.
She thought he must just have been worn out by the work.
But then a few years later, her mother died, and that seemed stranger still, because her mother came from a long line of people who just seemed to live forever.
In fact, Gayla's uncle is still alive to this day, and learning how to waltz.
It didn't make sense that Gayla's mother should die so young.
It was an anomaly, and she kept puzzling over anomalies.
And as she did, other ones came to mind.
She remembered, for example, when her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital, and she had a lot of x-rays, and two of them were leg x-rays, which made sense, but six of them were chest x-rays, which didn't.
She puzzled and puzzled over every piece of her life and her parents' life, trying to understand what she was seeing.
She thought about her town.
The town had a vermiculite mine in it.
Vermiculite was used for soil conditioners, to make plants grow faster and better.
Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts, huge amounts of it put under the roof to keep houses warm during the long Montana winters.
Vermiculite was in the playground.
It was in the football ground.
It was in the skating rink.
What she didn't learn until she started working this problem is vermiculite is a very toxic form of asbestos.
When she figured out the puzzle, she started telling everyone she could what had happened, what had been done to her parents and to the people that she saw on oxygen tanks at home in the afternoons.
But she was really amazed.
She thought, when everybody knows, they'll want to do something, but actually nobody wanted to know.
In fact, she became so annoying as she kept insisting on telling this story to her neighbors, to her friends, to other people in the community, that eventually a bunch of them got together and they made a bumper sticker, which they proudly displayed on their cars, which said, "Yes, I'm from Libby, Montana, and no, I don't have asbestosis."
But Gayla didn't stop. She kept doing research.
The advent of the Internet definitely helped her.
She talked to anybody she could.
She argued and argued, and finally she struck lucky when a researcher came through town studying the history of mines in the area, and she told him her story, and at first, of course, like everyone, he didn't believe her, but he went back to Seattle and he did his own research and he realized that she was right.
So now she had an ally.
Nevertheless, people still didn't want to know.
They said things like, "Well, if it were really dangerous, someone would have told us."
"If that's really why everyone was dying, the doctors would have told us."
Some of the guys used to very heavy jobs said, "I don't want to be a victim.
I can't possibly be a victim, and anyway, every industry has its accidents."
But still Gayla went on, and finally she succeeded in getting a federal agency to come to town and to screen the inhabitants of the town -- 15,000 people -- and what they discovered was that the town had a mortality rate 80 times higher than anywhere in the United States.
That was in 2002, and even at that moment, no one raised their hand to say, "Gayla, look in the playground where your grandchildren are playing.
It's lined with vermiculite."
This wasn't ignorance.
It was willful blindness.
Willful blindness is a legal concept which means, if there's information that you could know and you should know but you somehow manage not to know, the law deems that you're willfully blind.
You have chosen not to know.
There's a lot of willful blindness around these days.
You can see willful blindness in banks, when thousands of people sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them.
You could see them in banks when interest rates were manipulated and everyone around knew what was going on, but everyone studiously ignored it.
You can see willful blindness in the Catholic Church, where decades of child abuse went ignored.
You could see willful blindness in the run-up to the Iraq War.
Willful blindness exists on epic scales like those, and it also exists on very small scales, in people's families, in people's homes and communities, and particularly in organizations and institutions.
Companies that have been studied for willful blindness can be asked questions like, "Are there issues at work that people are afraid to raise?"
And when academics have done studies like this of corporations in the United States, what they find is 85 percent of people say yes.
Eighty-five percent of people know there's a problem, but they won't say anything.
And when I duplicated the research in Europe, asking all the same questions, I found exactly the same number.
Eighty-five percent. That's a lot of silence.
It's a lot of blindness.
And what's really interesting is that when I go to companies in Switzerland, they tell me, "This is a uniquely Swiss problem."
And when I go to Germany, they say, "Oh yes, this is the German disease."
And when I go to companies in England, they say, "Oh, yeah, the British are really bad at this."
And the truth is, this is a human problem.
We're all, under certain circumstances, willfully blind.
What the research shows is that some people are blind out of fear. They're afraid of retaliation.
And some people are blind because they think, well, seeing anything is just futile.
Nothing's ever going to change.
If we make a protest, if we protest against the Iraq War, nothing changes, so why bother?
Better not to see this stuff at all.
And the recurrent theme that I encounter all the time is people say, "Well, you know, the people who do see, they're whistleblowers, and we all know what happens to them."
So there's this profound mythology around whistleblowers which says, first of all, they're all crazy.
But what I've found going around the world and talking to whistleblowers is, actually, they're very loyal and quite often very conservative people.
They're hugely dedicated to the institutions that they work for, and the reason that they speak up, the reason they insist on seeing, is because they care so much about the institution and want to keep it healthy.
And the other thing that people often say about whistleblowers is, "Well, there's no point, because you see what happens to them.
They are crushed.
Nobody would want to go through something like that."
And yet, when I talk to whistleblowers, the recurrent tone that I hear is pride.
I think of Joe Darby.
We all remember the photographs of Abu Ghraib, which so shocked the world and showed the kind of war that was being fought in Iraq.
But I wonder who remembers Joe Darby, the very obedient, good soldier who found those photographs and handed them in.
And he said, "You know, I'm not the kind of guy to rat people out, but some things just cross the line.
Ignorance is bliss, they say, but you can't put up with things like this."
I talked to Steve Bolsin, a British doctor, who fought for five years to draw attention to a dangerous surgeon who was killing babies.
And I asked him why he did it, and he said, "Well, it was really my daughter who prompted me to do it.
She came up to me one night, and she just said, 'Dad, you can't let the kids die.'" Or I think of Cynthia Thomas, a really loyal army daughter and army wife, who, as she saw her friends and relations coming back from the Iraq War, was so shocked by their mental condition and the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge post-traumatic stress syndrome that she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town to give them legal, psychological and medical assistance.
And she said to me, she said, "You know, Margaret, I always used to say I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grow up.
But I've found myself in this cause, and I'll never be the same."
We all enjoy so many freedoms today, hard-won freedoms: the freedom to write and publish without fear of censorship, a freedom that wasn't here the last time I came to Hungary; a freedom to vote, which women in particular had to fight so hard for; the freedom for people of different ethnicities and cultures and sexual orientation to live the way that they want.
But freedom doesn't exist if you don't use it, and what whistleblowers do, and what people like Gayla Benefield do is they use the freedom that they have.
And what they're very prepared to do is recognize that yes, this is going to be an argument, and yes I'm going to have a lot of rows with my neighbors and my colleagues and my friends, but I'm going to become very good at this conflict.
I'm going to take on the naysayers, because they'll make my argument better and stronger.
I can collaborate with my opponents to become better at what I do.
These are people of immense persistence, incredible patience, and an absolute determination not to be blind and not to be silent.
When I went to Libby, Montana, I visited the asbestosis clinic that Gayla Benefield brought into being, a place where at first some of the people who wanted help and needed medical attention went in the back door because they didn't want to acknowledge that she'd been right.
I sat in a diner, and I watched as trucks drove up and down the highway, carting away the earth out of gardens and replacing it with fresh, uncontaminated soil.
I took my 12-year-old daughter with me, because I really wanted her to meet Gayla.
And she said, "Why? What's the big deal?"
I said, "She's not a movie star, and she's not a celebrity, and she's not an expert, and Gayla's the first person who'd say she's not a saint.
The really important thing about Gayla is she is ordinary.
She's like you, and she's like me.
She had freedom, and she was ready to use it."
Thank you very much.
<title>Margaret Heffernan: The dangers of "willful blindness"</title>
<description>Gayla Benefield was just doing her job -- until she uncovered an awful secret about her hometown that meant its mortality rate was 80 times higher than anywhere else in the U.S. But when she tried to tell people about it, she learned an even more shocking truth: People didn't want to know. In a talk that's part history lesson, part call-to-action, Margaret Heffernan demonstrates the danger of "willful blindness" and praises ordinary people like Benefield who are willing to speak up. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

Many times I go around the world to speak, and people ask me questions about the challenges, my moments, some of my regrets.
1998: A single mother of four, three months after the birth of my fourth child, I went to do a job as a research assistant.
I went to Northern Liberia.
And as part of the work, the village would give you lodgings.
And they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter.
This girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade.
She was the laughing stock of the community.
Her mother was often told by other women, "You and your child will die poor."
After two weeks of working in that village, it was time to go back.
The mother came to me, knelt down, and said, "Leymah, take my daughter.
I wish for her to be a nurse."
Dirt poor, living in the home with my parents, I couldn't afford to.
With tears in my eyes, I said, "No."
Two months later, I go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief.
The women's chief of the village has this little girl, fair color like me, totally dirty.
And all day she walked around only in her underwear.
When I asked, "Who is that?"
She said, "That's Wei.
The meaning of her name is pig.
Her mother died while giving birth to her, and no one had any idea who her father was."
For two weeks, she became my companion, slept with me.
I bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll.
The night before I left, she came to the room and said, "Leymah, don't leave me here.
I wish to go with you.
I wish to go to school."
Dirt poor, no money, living with my parents, I again said, "No."
Two months later, both of those villages fell into another war.
Till today, I have no idea where those two girls are.
Fast-forward, 2004: In the peak of our activism, the minister of Gender Liberia called me and said, "Leymah, I have a nine-year-old for you.
I want you to bring her home because we don't have safe homes."
The story of this little girl: She had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months.
She came to me bloated, very pale.
Every night I'd come from work and lie on the cold floor.
She'd lie beside me and say, "Auntie, I wish to be well.
I wish to go to school."
2010: A young woman stands before President Sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together, their father and mother died during the war.
She's 19; her dream is to go to college to be able to support them.
She's highly athletic.
One of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship.
Full scholarship. She gets it.
Her dream of going to school, her wish of being educated, is finally here.
She goes to school on the first day.
The director of sports who's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class.
And for the next three years, her fate will be having sex with him every day, as a favor for getting her in school.
Globally, we have policies, international instruments, work leaders.
Great people have made commitments -- we will protect our children from want and from fear.
The U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Countries like America, we've heard things like No Child Left Behind.
Other countries come with different things.
There is a Millennium Development called Three that focuses on girls.
All of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally, I think, has failed.
In Liberia, for example, the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls.
Teen prostitution is at its peak.
In one community, we're told, you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper.
Girls as young as 12 being prostituted for less than a dollar a night.
It's disheartening, it's sad.
And then someone asked me, just before my TEDTalk, a few days ago, "So where is the hope?"
Several years ago, a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women.
It's not enough to say you have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia when your girls' kids are totally out there and no hope, or seemingly no hope.
We created a space called the Young Girls Transformative Project.
We go into rural communities and all we do, like has been done in this room, is create the space.
When these girls sit, you unlock intelligence, you unlock passion, you unlock commitment, you unlock focus, you unlock great leaders.
Today, we've worked with over 300.
And some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps, as young mothers, to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women.
One young woman I met, teen mother of four, never thought about finishing high school, graduated successfully; never thought about going to college, enrolled in college.
One day she said to me, "My wish is to finish college and be able to support my children."
She's at a place where she can't find money to go to school.
She sells water, sells soft drinks and sells recharge cards for cellphones.
And you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education.
Juanita is her name.
She takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school.
Says, "Leymah, my wish is to be educated.
And if I can't be educated, when I see some of my sisters being educated, my wish has been fulfilled.
I wish for a better life.
I wish for food for my children.
I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop."
This is the dream of the African girl.
Several years ago, there was one African girl.
This girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry.
Angry, frustrated, really upset about the state of her society and the state of her children, this young girl started a movement, a movement of ordinary women banding together to build peace.
I will fulfill the wish.
This is another African girl's wish.
I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls.
I failed to do this.
These were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman -- I failed, I failed, I failed.
So I will do this.
Women came out, protested a brutal dictator, fearlessly spoke.
Not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true, the wish of peace came true.
This young woman wished also to go to school.
She went to school.
This young woman wished for other things to happen, it happened for her.
Today, this young woman is me, a Nobel laureate.
I'm now on a journey to fulfill the wish, in my tiny capacity, of little African girls -- the wish of being educated.
We set up a foundation.
We're giving full four-year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential.
I don't have much to ask of you.
I've also been to places in this U.S., and I know that girls in this country also have wishes, a wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx, a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown L.A., a wish for a better life somewhere in Texas, a wish for a better life somewhere in New York, a wish for a better life somewhere in New Jersey.
Will you journey with me to help that girl, be it an African girl or an American girl or a Japanese girl, fulfill her wish, fulfill her dream, achieve that dream?
Because all of these great innovators and inventors that we've talked to and seen over the last few days are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world, and all they're asking us to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence, unlock the passion, unlock all of the great things that they hold within themselves.
Let's journey together. Let's journey together.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Right now in Liberia, what do you see as the main issue that troubles you?
LG: I've been asked to lead the Liberian Reconciliation Initiative.
As part of my work, I'm doing these tours in different villages and towns -- 13, 15 hours on dirt roads -- and there is no community that I've gone into that I haven't seen intelligent girls.
But sadly, the vision of a great future, or the dream of a great future, is just a dream, because you have all of these vices.
Teen pregnancy, like I said, is epidemic.
So what troubles me is that I was at that place and somehow I'm at this place, and I just don't want to be the only one at this place.
I'm looking for ways for other girls to be with me.
I want to look back 20 years from now and see that there's another Liberian girl, Ghanaian girl, Nigerian girl, Ethiopian girl standing on this TED stage.
And maybe, just maybe, saying, "Because of that Nobel laureate I'm here today."
So I'm troubled when I see them like there's no hope.
But I'm also not pessimistic, because I know it doesn't take a lot to get them charged up.
And in the last year, tell us one hopeful thing that you've seen happening.
LG: I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening.
But in the last year, where President Sirleaf comes from, her village, we went there to work with these girls.
And we could not find 25 girls in high school.
All of these girls went to the gold mine, and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things.
We took 50 of those girls and we worked with them.
And this was at the beginning of elections.
This is one place where women were never -- even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men.
These girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration.
This is a real rural village.
And the theme they used was: "Even pretty girls vote."
They were able to mobilize young women.
But not only did they do that, they went to those who were running for seats to ask them, "What is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win?"
And one of the guys who already had a seat was very -- because Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws, and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric.
Rape is not barbaric, but the law, he said, was barbaric.
And when the girls started engaging him, he was very hostile towards them.
These little girls turned to him and said, "We will vote you out of office."
He's out of office today.
Leymah, thank you. Thank you so much for coming to TED.
LG: You're welcome.

If you're here today -- and I'm very happy that you are -- you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large, urban areas like New York City.
And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.
The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog: an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998.
She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.
When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront, despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week.
The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.
So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed grant initiative seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive.
I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river because of all the lovely facilities that I'd mentioned earlier.
Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.
There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me -- and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river.
I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.
And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.
And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined.
We garnered much support along the way.
And the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years.
We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times into a $3 million park.
And, in the fall, I'm actually going to -- I exchange marriage vows with my beloved. Thank you very much.
That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.
But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coalmine. We feel the problems right now, and have for some time.
Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other.
Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities.
As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health.
I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility -- which I do.
These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma.
Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?
Our 27 percent obesity rate is high, even for this country, and diabetes comes with it.
One out of four South Bronx children has asthma.
Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average.
These impacts are coming everyone's way.
And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs, health problems associated with pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts of untapped potential.
50 percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line.
25 percent of us are unemployed. Low-income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care.
This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits.
Poor people are not only still poor; they are still unhealthy.
Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term.
None of us want that, and we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common?
Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking -- -- graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. OK.
Good.
But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways.
I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down.
My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home.
Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street.
Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto.
These things make me different from you.
But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds, with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other.
So how did things get so different for us?
In the late '40s, my dad -- a Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later he married my mom.
At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood.
My dad was not alone.
And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country.
Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment.
Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding.
Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to.
A national highway construction boom was added to our problems.
In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaign.
One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.
The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance.
Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed.
600,000 people were displaced.
The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.
And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that is bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you?
So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home and all we had.
And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.
Now, why is this story important?
Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation.
The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come.
Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood.
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided?
What costs are associated with these decisions? And who pays?
Who profits? Does anything justify what the local community goes through?
This was "planning" -- in quotes -- that did not have our best interests in mind.
Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning.
That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a greenway movement in the South Bronx.
I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths.
Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life.
They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development.
Think bike shops, juice stands.
We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects.
This is Lafayette Avenue -- and as redesigned by Matthews-Nielsen landscape architects.
And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park.
Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.
As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more.
We run a project called the Bronx Ecological Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restorations, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs.
Little by little, we're seeding the area with green collar jobs -- then the people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment.
The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it.
Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused.
The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway.
We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.
We also built the city's -- New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices.
Cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat and pass it on to the building or atmosphere.
Green roofs are soil and living plants.
Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban "heat island" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine.
And they provide habitats for our little friends!
So -- -- so cool!
Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.
I like that, too.
Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: we need investors. End of pitch.
It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.
Anyway -- OK. Katrina. Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz.
Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another.
In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common.
We're at best ignored and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability.
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable.
But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out.
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight.
Or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone.
Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two like the South Bronx did?
Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?
Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral.
This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through, like a tiny little bit. You've no clue.
But I'll tell you later if you want to know.
But -- I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end.
I'm interested in what I like to call the "triple bottom line" that sustainable development can produce.
Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up.
At present, that's not happening in New York City.
And we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit.
A parade of government subsidies is going to proposed big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny.
Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks.
Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier.
And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit.
Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes.
My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues.
Now let's get this straight. I am not anti-development.
Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist.
You probably all have it, and if you haven't, you need to.
So I don't have a problem with developers making money.
There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune.
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that.
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit.
That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create.
But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities.
This is my version of globalization.
Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking: a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx.
However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly influential mayor named Enrique Penalosa.
He looked at the demographics.
Few Bogatanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them.
If you're a mayor, you can do something about that.
His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world.
For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached.
But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened.
People stopped littering; crime rates dropped -- because the streets were alive with people.
His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget at that.
We have no excuse in this country. I'm sorry.
But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather to provide opportunities for all Bogatanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the US.
But Bogota's example has the power to change that.
You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence.
That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange.
Use your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere.
Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal.
Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy.
Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations.
Help me fight for environmental and economic justice.
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return.
Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere.
Oh good, glad I have a little more time!
Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy.
His response was a grant program.
I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding.
I was making him an offer.
What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around.
Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.
But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process.
Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count.
I have come from so far to meet you like this.
Please don't waste me. By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world.
We might have come to this conference from very, very different stations in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing: we have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
Ciao bellos!

<title>Majora Carter: Greening the ghetto</title>
<description>In an emotionally charged talk, MacArthur-winning activist Majora Carter details her fight for environmental justice in the South Bronx -- and shows how minority neighborhoods suffer most from flawed urban policy.</description>

The day I left home for the first time to go to university was a bright day brimming with hope and optimism.
I'd done well at school. Expectations for me were high, and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures, parties and traffic cone theft.
Now appearances, of course, can be deceptive, and to an extent, this feisty, energetic persona of lecture-going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer, albeit a very well-crafted and convincing one.
Underneath, I was actually deeply unhappy, insecure and fundamentally frightened -- frightened of other people, of the future, of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me.
But I was skilled at hiding it, and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and aspire to.
This fantasy of invulnerability was so complete that I even deceived myself, and as the first semester ended and the second began, there was no way that anyone could have predicted what was just about to happen.
I was leaving a seminar when it started, humming to myself, fumbling with my bag just as I'd done a hundred times before, when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe, "She is leaving the room."
I looked around, and there was no one there, but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable.
Shaken, I left my books on the stairs and hurried home, and there it was again.
"She is opening the door."
This was the beginning. The voice had arrived.
And the voice persisted, days and then weeks of it, on and on, narrating everything I did in the third person.
"She is going to the library."
"She is going to a lecture."
It was neutral, impassive and even, after a while, strangely companionate and reassuring, although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion.
So, for example, if I was angry and had to hide it, which I often did, being very adept at concealing how I really felt, then the voice would sound frustrated.
Otherwise, it was neither sinister nor disturbing, although even at that point it was clear that it had something to communicate to me about my emotions, particularly emotions which were remote and inaccessible.
Now it was then that I made a fatal mistake, in that I told a friend about the voice, and she was horrified.
A subtle conditioning process had begun, the implication that normal people don't hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong.
Such fear and mistrust was infectious.
Suddenly the voice didn't seem quite so benign anymore, and when she insisted that I seek medical attention, I duly complied, and which proved to be mistake number two.
I spent some time telling the college G.P.
about what I perceived to be the real problem: anxiety, low self-worth, fears about the future, and was met with bored indifference until I mentioned the voice, upon which he dropped his pen, swung round and began to question me with a show of real interest.
And to be fair, I was desperate for interest and help, and I began to tell him about my strange commentator.
And I always wish, at this point, the voice had said, "She is digging her own grave."
I was referred to a psychiatrist, who likewise took a grim view of the voice's presence, subsequently interpreting everything I said through a lens of latent insanity.
For example, I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus, and during an appointment which was running very late, I said, "I'm sorry, doctor, I've got to go.
I'm reading the news at six."
Now it's down on my medical records that Eleanor has delusions that she's a television news broadcaster.
It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me.
A hospital admission followed, the first of many, a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next, and then, worst of all, a toxic, tormenting sense of hopelessness, humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects.
But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom, my fear and resistance towards it intensified.
Now essentially, this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind, a kind of psychic civil war, and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing.
Helplessly and hopelessly, I began to retreat into this nightmarish inner world in which the voices were destined to become both my persecutors and my only perceived companions.
They told me, for example, that if I proved myself worthy of their help, then they could change my life back to how it had been, and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set, a kind of labor of Hercules.
It started off quite small, for example, pull out three strands of hair, but gradually it grew more extreme, culminating in commands to harm myself, and a particularly dramatic instruction: "You see that tutor over there?
You see that glass of water?
Well, you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students."
Which I actually did, and which needless to say did not endear me to the faculty.
In effect, a vicious cycle of fear, avoidance, mistrust and misunderstanding had been established, and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation.
Two years later, and the deterioration was dramatic.
By now, I had the whole frenzied repertoire: terrifying voices, grotesque visions, bizarre, intractable delusions.
My mental health status had been a catalyst for discrimination, verbal abuse, and physical and sexual assault, and I'd been told by my psychiatrist, "Eleanor, you'd be better off with cancer, because cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia."
I'd been diagnosed, drugged and discarded, and was by now so tormented by the voices that I attempted to drill a hole in my head in order to get them out.
Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years, it seems to me now as if someone died in that place, and yet, someone else was saved.
A broken and haunted person began that journey, but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be.
Many people have harmed me in my life, and I remember them all, but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who've helped me.
The fellow survivors, the fellow voice-hearers, the comrades and collaborators; the mother who never gave up on me, who knew that one day I would come back to her and was willing to wait for me for as long as it took; the doctor who only worked with me for a brief time but who reinforced his belief that recovery was not only possible but inevitable, and during a devastating period of relapse told my terrified family, "Don't give up hope.
I believe that Eleanor can get through this.
Sometimes, you know, it snows as late as May, but summer always comes eventually."
Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized, lonely place.
But together, they forged a blend of courage, creativity, integrity, and an unshakeable belief that my shattered self could become healed and whole.
I used to say that these people saved me, but what I now know is they did something even more important in that they empowered me to save myself, and crucially, they helped me to understand something which I'd always suspected: that my voices were a meaningful response to traumatic life events, particularly childhood events, and as such were not my enemies but a source of insight into solvable emotional problems.
Now, at first, this was very difficult to believe, not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing, so in this respect, a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth.
So for example, voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world, rather than an actual, objective danger.
Now at first, I would have believed them.
I remember, for example, sitting up one night on guard outside my parents' room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices.
Because I'd had such a bad problem with self-injury that most of the cutlery in the house had been hidden, so I ended up arming myself with a plastic fork, kind of like picnic ware, and sort of sat outside the room clutching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen.
It was like, "Don't mess with me.
I've got a plastic fork, don't you know?"
Strategic.
But a later response, and much more useful, would be to try and deconstruct the message behind the words, so when the voices warned me not to leave the house, then I would thank them for drawing my attention to how unsafe I felt -- because if I was aware of it, then I could do something positive about it -- but go on to reassure both them and myself that we were safe and didn't need to feel frightened anymore.
I would set boundaries for the voices, and try to interact with them in a way that was assertive yet respectful, establishing a slow process of communication and collaboration in which we could learn to work together and support one another.
Throughout all of this, what I would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself, and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had an opportunity to process or resolve, memories of sexual trauma and abuse, of anger, shame, guilt, low self-worth.
The voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it, and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly, and as such, it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care.
It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self, each fragment represented by a different voice, gradually withdraw from all my medication, and return to psychiatry, only this time from the other side.
Ten years after the voice first came, I finally graduated, this time with the highest degree in psychology the university had ever given, and one year later, the highest masters, which shall we say isn't bad for a madwoman.
In fact, one of the voices actually dictated the answers during the exam, which technically possibly counts as cheating.
And to be honest, sometimes I quite enjoyed their attention as well.
As Oscar Wilde has said, the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.
It also makes you very good at eavesdropping, because you can listen to two conversations simultaneously.
So it's not all bad.
I worked in mental health services, I spoke at conferences, I published book chapters and academic articles, and I argued, and continue to do so, the relevance of the following concept: that an important question in psychiatry shouldn't be what's wrong with you but rather what's happened to you.
And all the while, I listened to my voices, with whom I'd finally learned to live with peace and respect and which in turn reflected a growing sense of compassion, acceptance and respect towards myself.
And I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment when supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices, and becoming fully aware, for the very first time, that I no longer felt that way myself but was finally able to help someone else who was.
I'm now very proud to be a part of Intervoice, the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement, an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher, which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy, a sane reaction to insane circumstances, not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured, but a complex, significant and meaningful experience to be explored.
Together, we envisage and enact a society that understands and respects voice hearing, supports the needs of individuals who hear voices, and which values them as full citizens.
This type of society is not only possible, it's already on its way.
To paraphrase Chavez, once social change begins, it cannot be reversed.
You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride.
You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore.
For me, the achievements of the Hearing Voices Movement are a reminder that empathy, fellowship, justice and respect are more than words; they are convictions and beliefs, and that beliefs can change the world.
In the last 20 years, the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents, working together to promote dignity, solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress, to create a new language and practice of hope, which, at its very center, lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual.
As Peter Levine has said, the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity.
In this respect, for members of society, there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone, to bear witness, to reach out a hand, to share the burden of someone's suffering, and to hold the hope for their recovery.
And likewise, for survivors of distress and adversity, that we remember we don't have to live our lives forever defined by the damaging things that have happened to us.
We are unique. We are irreplaceable.
What lies within us can never be truly colonized, contorted, or taken away.
The light never goes out.
As a very wonderful doctor once said to me, "Don't tell me what other people have told you about yourself.
Tell me about you."
Thank you.

<title>Eleanor Longden: The voices in my head</title>
<description>To all appearances, Eleanor Longden was just like every other student, heading to college full of promise and without a care in the world. That was until the voices in her head started talking. Initially innocuous, these internal narrators became increasingly antagonistic and dictatorial, turning her life into a living nightmare. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, hospitalized, drugged, Longden was discarded by a system that didn't know how to help her. Longden tells the moving tale of her years-long journey back to mental health, and makes the case that it was through learning to listen to her voices that she was able to survive.</description>

Salaam. Namaskar.
Good morning.
Given my TED profile, you might be expecting that I'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends -- the one that's currently got Wall Street and the World Bank buzzing -- how to invest in women, how to empower them, how to save them.
Not me.
I am interested in how women are saving us.
They're saving us by redefining and re-imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities, polarities we've taken for granted for a long time, like the ones between modernity and tradition, First World and Third World, oppression and opportunity.
In the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community, there's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing.
What intrigues me most is how women are doing this, despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating.
Why is it that women are, on the one hand, viciously oppressed by cultural practices, and yet at the same time, are the preservers of cultures in most societies?
Is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance?
When so many women and girls are beaten, raped, maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes -- honor, religion, nationality -- what allows women to replant trees, to rebuild societies, to lead radical, non-violent movements for social change?
Is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing?
Or are they one and the same?
Are we guilty, as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us at the TED conference in Oxford, of assuming that there is a single story of women's struggles for their rights while there are, in fact, many?
And what, if anything, do men have to do with it?
Much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions.
It's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people.
In the process, I've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle.
Among those who've helped open my eyes to a third way are: a devout Muslim in Afghanistan, a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia and a taboo breaker in Liberia.
I'm indebted to them, as I am to my parents, who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life, were blessed with three daughters in this one.
And for reasons equally unclear to me, seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us.
I was born and raised here in India, and I learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down, pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all, "Poor things. You only have three daughters.
But you're young, you could still try again."
My sense of outrage about women's rights was brought to a boil when I was about 11.
My aunt, an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman, was widowed early.
A flock of relatives descended on her.
They took off her colorful sari.
They made her wear a white one.
They wiped her bindi off her forehead.
They broke her bangles.
Her daughter, Rani, a few years older than me, sat in her lap bewildered, not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother.
Late that night, I heard my mother begging my father, "Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene?"
And my father, in a low voice, muttering, "I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do.
This is tradition."
That's the night I learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world.
Women don't make those rules, but they define us, and they define our opportunities and our chances.
And men are affected by those rules too.
My father, who had fought in three wars, could not save his own sister from this suffering.
By 18, under the excellent tutelage of my mother, I was therefore, as you might expect, defiantly feminist.
On the streets chanting, "[Hindi] [Hindi] We are the women of India.
We are not flowers, we are sparks of change."
By the time I got to Beijing in 1995, it was clear to me, the only way to achieve gender equality was to overturn centuries of oppressive tradition.
Soon after I returned from Beijing, I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization, founded by women, to support women's rights organizations around the globe.
But barely six months into my new job, I met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions.
Her name is Sakena Yacoobi.
She walked into my office at a time when no one knew where Afghanistan was in the United States.
She said to me, "It is not about the burka."
She was the most determined advocate for women's rights I had ever heard.
She told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside Afghanistan, and that her organization, the Afghan Institute of Learning, had started a school in Pakistan.
She said, "The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows is that the Koran requires and strongly supports literacy.
The prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the Koran for themselves."
Had I heard right?
Was a women's rights advocate invoking religion?
But Sakena defies labels.
She always wears a headscarf, but I've walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze.
She starts every lecture with a prayer, but she's a single, feisty, financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12.
She is also immensely pragmatic.
"This headscarf and these clothes," she says, "give me the freedom to do what I need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work.
When I had to open the school in the refugee camp, I went to see the imam.
I told him, 'I'm a believer, and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive.'" She smiles slyly.
"He was flattered.
He began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque.
And after he would leave, women and girls would stay behind.
We began with a small literacy class to read the Koran, then a math class, then an English class, then computer classes.
In a few weeks, everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes."
Sakena is a teacher at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in Afghanistan.
She is on the Taliban's hit list.
I worry about her every time she travels across that country.
She shrugs when I ask her about safety.
"Kavita jaan, we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid.
Look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face."
And I smile, and I nod, realizing I'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices, turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity.
Their path is their own and it looks towards an Afghanistan that will be different.
Being different is something the women of Lesbor in Zagreb, Croatia know all too well.
To be a lesbian, a dyke, a homosexual in most parts of the world, including right here in our country, India, is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice.
In post-conflict societies like Croatia, where a hyper-nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast.
So enter a group of out dykes, young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from Macedonia to Bosnia, from Serbia to Slovenia.
These folk singers met at college at a gender studies program.
Many are in their 20s, some are mothers.
Many have struggled to come out to their communities, in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick, just queer.
As Leah, one of the founders of the group, says, "I like traditional music very much.
I also like rock and roll.
So Lesbor, we blend the two.
I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion, in which people can really speak their voice, especially traditional songs from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic.
After the war, lots of these songs were lost, but they are a part of our childhood and our history, and we should not forget them."
Improbably, this LGBT singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change, like alchemists turning discord into harmony.
Their repertoire includes the Croatian national anthem, a Bosnian love song and Serbian duets.
And, Leah adds with a grin, "Kavita, we especially are proud of our Christmas music, because it shows we are open to religious practices even though Catholic Church hates us LGBT."
Their concerts draw from their own communities, yes, but also from an older generation: a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality, but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents.
One father, who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir, now writes songs for them.
In the Middle Ages, troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses: Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this, singing, connecting people divided by religion, nationality and language.
Bosnians, Croats and Serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history, and Lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all.
Yesterday, Mallika Sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given.
The world Layma Bowie was given was a world at war.
Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades.
Layma was not an activist, she was a mother of three.
But she was sick with worry: She worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier, she worried her daughters would be raped, she worried for their lives.
One night, she had a dream.
She dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed.
The next morning at church, she asked others how they felt.
They were all tired of the fighting.
We need peace, and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace.
Among Layma's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim.
She promised to raise the issue with her community.
At the next Friday sermon, the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs.
"What does it matter?" they said, "A bullet doesn't distinguish between a Muslim and a Christian."
This small group of women, determined to bring an end to the war, and they chose to use their traditions to make a point: Liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing.
But no, for the protest, they dressed all in white, no makeup.
As Layma said, "We wore the white saying we were out for peace."
They stood on the side of the road on which Charles Taylor's motorcade passed every day.
They stood for weeks -- first just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women -- wearing white, singing, dancing, saying they were out for peace.
Eventually, opposing forces in Liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana.
The peace talks dragged on and on and on.
Layma and her sisters had had enough.
With their remaining funds, they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building.
In a now famous CNN clip, you can see them sitting on the ground, their arms linked.
We know this in India. It's called a [Hindi].
Then things get tense.
The police are called in to physically remove the women.
As the senior officer approaches with a baton, Layma stands up with deliberation, reaches her arms up over her head, and begins, very slowly, to untie her headdress that covers her hair.
You can see the policeman's face.
He looks embarrassed. He backs away.
And the next thing you know, the police have disappeared.
Layma said to me later, "It's a taboo, you know, in West Africa.
If an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to, the man's family is cursed."
She said, "I don't know if he did it because he believed, but he knew we were not going to leave.
We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed."
And the peace accord was signed.
And the women of Liberia then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in Africa in years.
When she made her presidential address, she acknowledged these brave women of Liberia who allowed her to win against a football star -- that's soccer for you Americans -- no less.
Women like Sakena and Leah and Layma have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that I should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind.
They've also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way.
A Filipina activist once said to me, "How do you cook a rice cake?
With heat from the bottom and heat from the top."
The protests, the marches, the uncompromising position that women's rights are human rights, full stop.
That's the heat from the bottom.
That's Malcolm X and the suffragists and gay pride parades.
But we also need the heat from the top.
And in most parts of the world, that top is still controlled by men.
So to paraphrase Marx: Women make change, but not in circumstances of their own choosing.
They have to negotiate.
They have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations.
And they need allies from their communities.
Allies like the imam, allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in Croatia, allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away, allies like my father, who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams.
Maybe this is because feminism, unlike almost every other social movement, is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor -- it's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers -- it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women, far too often, hold ourselves.
And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism, that the personal is in fact the political.
So that, as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights, the same is true of gender equality: that it starts in small places, close to home.
On the streets, yes, but also in negotiations at the kitchen table and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends.
And then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles, women like Sakena and Leah and Layma -- but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India and Michelle Bachelet in Chile and Shirin Ebadi in Iran -- are doing something else.
They're challenging the very notion of Western models of development.
They are saying, we don't have to be like you to make change.
We can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou, and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers.
We can use our tradition to navigate change.
We can demilitarize societies and pour resources, instead, into reservoirs of genuine security.
It is in these little stories, these individual stories, that I see a radical epic being written by women around the world.
It is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities, that I find hope.
And if my heart is singing, it's because in these little fragments, every now and again, you catch a glimpse of a whole, of a whole new world.
And she is definitely on her way.
Thank you.

I was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the P.O. box at the end of the day, and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email, in Facebook, in texting or cell phones in general.
And so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents, I was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone, which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital, but I was just looking for some sort of scribble, some unkempt cursive from my mother.
And so when I moved to New York City after college and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression, I did the only thing I could think of at the time.
I wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me for strangers, and tucked them all throughout the city, dozens and dozens of them. I left them everywhere, in cafes and in libraries, at the U.N., everywhere.
I blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary, and I posed a kind of crazy promise to the Internet: that if you asked me for a hand-written letter, I would write you one, no questions asked.
Overnight, my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak -- a single mother in Sacramento, a girl being bullied in rural Kansas, all asking me, a 22-year-old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order, to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox.
Well, today I fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox, fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most, but most of all, fueled by crates of mail like this one, my trusty mail crate, filled with the scriptings of ordinary people, strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee, but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing.
But, you know, the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper.
They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters.
They're the ones from my generation, the ones of us that have grown up into a world where everything is paperless, and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen.
We have learned to diary our pain onto Facebook, and we speak swiftly in 140 characters or less.
But what if it's not about efficiency this time?
I was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate, which is a conversation starter, let me tell you.
If you ever need one, just carry one of these.
And a man just stared at me, and he was like, "Well, why don't you use the Internet?"
And I thought, "Well, sir, I am not a strategist, nor am I specialist. I am merely a storyteller."
And so I could tell you about a woman whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan, and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation, and so she tucks love letters throughout the house as a way to say, "Come back to me.
Find me when you can."
Or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters around her campus in Dubuque, Iowa, only to find her efforts ripple-effected the next day when she walks out onto the quad and finds love letters hanging from the trees, tucked in the bushes and the benches.
Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life, uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family.
Well, tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow, scripted by strangers who were there for him when.
These are the kinds of stories that convinced me that letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair and talk about efficiency, because she is an art form now, all the parts of her, the signing, the scripting, the mailing, the doodles in the margins.
The mere fact that somebody would even just sit down, pull out a piece of paper and think about someone the whole way through, with an intention that is so much harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iPhone is pinging and we've got six conversations rolling in at once, that is an art form that does not fall down to the Goliath of "get faster," no matter how many social networks we might join.
We still clutch close these letters to our chest, to the words that speak louder than loud, when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say, the words that we have needed to write, to sisters and brothers and even to strangers, for far too long.
Thank you.

<title>Hannah Brencher: Love letters to strangers</title>
<description>Hannah Brencher's mother always wrote her letters. So when she felt herself bottom into depression after college, she did what felt natural -- she wrote love letters and left them for strangers to find. The act has become a global initiative, The World Needs More Love Letters, which rushes handwritten letters to those in need of a boost.</description>

I'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work.
These are not discoveries of planets or new technologies or science.
They're discoveries of people and the way people are, and new leadership.
This is Benki.
Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation.
His people live in Brazil and in Peru.
Benki comes from a village so remote up in the Amazon that to get there, either you have to fly and land on water, or go by canoe for several days.
I met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo when I'd brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples to meet with me and leaders from around the world, because we wanted to learn from each other.
We wanted to share our stories with each other.
The Ashaninka people are known throughout South America for their dignity, their spirit and their resistance, starting with the Incas and continuing through the 19th century with the rubber tappers.
Today's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people and to Benki comes from illegal logging -- the people who come into the beautiful forest and cut down ancient mahogany trees, float them down the river to world markets.
Benki knew this.
He could see what was happening to his forest, to his environment, because he was taken under his grandfather's wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people.
His grandfather died when he was only 10.
And at that young age, 10 years old, Benki became the paje of his community.
Now, in the Ashaninka tradition and culture, the paje is the most important person in the community.
This is the person who contains within him all the knowledge, all the wisdom of centuries and centuries of life, and not just about his people, but about everything that his people's survival depended on: the trees, the birds, the water, the soil, the forest.
So when he was only 10 and he became the paje, he began to lead his people.
He began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect, the way of life they needed to nurture.
He explained to them that it was not a question of survival of the fittest; it was a question of understanding what they needed to survive and to protect that.
Eight years later, when he was a young man of 18, Benki left the forest for the first time.
He went 3,000 miles on an odyssey to Rio to the Earth Summit to tell the world what was happening in his tiny, little corner.
And he went because he hoped the world would listen.
Some did, not everybody.
But if you can imagine this young man with his headdress and his flowing robe, learning a new language, Portuguese, not to mention English, going to Rio, building a bridge to reach out to people he'd never met before -- a pretty hostile world.
But he wasn't dismayed.
Benki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies, new research, new ways of understanding what was going on.
Since that time, he's continued to work with his people, and not only the Ashaninka Nation, but all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond.
He's built schools to teach children to care for the forest.
Together, he's led the reforestation of over 25 percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers.
He's created a cooperative to help people diversify their livelihoods.
And he's brought the internet and satellite technology to the forest -- both so that people themselves could monitor the deforestation, but also that he could speak from the forest to the rest of the world.
If you were to meet Benki and ask him, "Why are you doing this?
Why are you putting yourself at risk?
Why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a hostile world?"
he would tell you, as he told me, "I asked myself," he said, "What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do to protect the forest for me?
And what am I doing?"
So when I think of that, I wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren, when they ask themselves that question, I wonder how they will answer.
For me, the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside.
It's a future we don't know the details of, but it's a future that has signs, just like Benki saw the signs around him.
We know we are running out of what we need.
We're running out of fresh water.
We're running out of fossil fuels.
We're running out of land.
We know climate change is going to affect all of us.
We don't know how, but we know it will.
And we know that there will be more of us than ever before -- five times as many people in 40 years than 60 years ago.
We are running out of what we need.
And we also know that the world has changed in other ways, that since 1960 there are one-third as many new countries that exist as independent entities on the planet.
Egos, systems of government -- figuring it out -- massive change.
And in addition to that, we know that five other really big countries are going to have a say in the future, a say we haven't even really started to hear yet -- China, India, Russia, South Africa and Benki's own Brazil, where Benki got his civil rights only in the 1988 constitution.
But you know all that.
You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest and went 3,000 miles.
You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done, because we'll get the results we've always gotten.
And this reminds me of something I understand Lord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago, when she was pressing him, "Please change."
He said, "Change?
Why change?
Things are bad enough as they are."
We have to change.
It's imperative to me, when I look around the world, that we need to change ourselves.
We need new models of what it means to be a leader.
We need new models of being a leader and a human in the world.
I started life as a banker.
Now I don't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends.
But for the past eight years, I've done something completely different.
My work has taken me around the world, where I've had the real privilege of meeting people like Benki and many others who are making change happen in their communities -- people who see the world differently, who are asking different questions, who have different answers, who understand the filters that they wear when they go out into the world.
This is Sanghamitra.
Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore.
I met Sanghamitra eight years ago when I was in Bangalore organizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's working in some of the hardest aspects of society.
Sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an NGO, she started her career as university professor, teaching English literature.
But she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that.
She loved it, but she was too detached.
And so in 1993, a long time ago, she decided to start a new organization called Samraksha focused on one of the hardest areas, one of the hardest issues in India -- anywhere in the world at the time -- HIV/AIDS.
Since that time, Samraksha has grown from strength to strength and is now one of the leading health NGO's in India.
But if you just think about the state of the world and knowledge of HIV/AIDS in 1993 -- in India at that time it was skyrocketing and nobody understood why, and everyone was actually very, very afraid.
Today there are still three million HIV-positive people in India.
That's the second largest population in the world.
When I asked Sanghamitra, "How did you get from English literature to HIV/AIDS?"
not an obvious path, she said to me, "It's all connected.
Literature makes one sensitive, sensitive to people, to their dreams and to their ideas."
Since that time, under her leadership, Samraksha has been a pioneer in all fields related to HIV/AIDS.
They have respite homes, the first, the first care centers, the first counseling services -- and not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore, but in the hardest to reach villages in the state of Karnataka.
Even that wasn't enough.
She wanted to change policy at the government level.
10 of their programs that she pioneered are now government policy and funded by the government.
They take care of 20,000-odd people today in over 1,000 villages around Karnataka.
She works with people like Murali Krishna.
Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages.
He lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago, and he's HIV-positive.
But he saw the work, the care, the compassion that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village, and he wanted to be part of it.
He's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work.
They've pioneered a different approach to villages.
Instead of handing out information in pamphlets, as is so often the case, they bring theater troupes, songs, music, dance.
And they sit around, and they talk about dreams.
Sanghamitra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages, and she had a real breakthrough.
They were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village.
And the young women in the village spoke up and said, "We've changed our dream.
Our dream is for our partners, our husbands, not to be given to us because of a horoscope, but to be given to us because they've been tested for HIV."
If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra and ask her why and how, how have you achieved so much?
She would look at you and very quietly, very softly say, "It just happened.
It's the spirit inside."
This is Dr. Fan Jianchuan.
Jianchuan comes from Sichuan Province in southwest China.
He was born in 1957, and you can imagine what his childhood looked like and felt like, and what his life has been like over the last 50 tumultuous years.
He's been a soldier, a teacher, a politician, a vice-mayor and a business man.
But if you sat down and asked him, "Who are you really, and what do you do?"
He would tell you, "I'm a collector, and I curate a museum."
I was lucky; I had heard about him for years, and I finally met him earlier this year at his museum in Chengdu.
He's been a collector all of his life, starting when he was four or five in the early 1960's.
Now, just think of the early 1960's in China.
Over a lifetime, through everything, through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward, he's kept collecting, so that he now has over eight million pieces in his museums documenting contemporary Chinese history.
These are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world, in part because they document parts of history Chinese choose to forget.
For example, he's got over one million pieces documenting the Sino-Japanese War, a war that's not talked about in China very much and whose heroes are not honored.
Why did he do all this?
Because he thought a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past.
So, from commissioning slightly larger than life bronze statues of the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War, including those Chinese who then fought with each other and left mainland China to go to Taiwan, to commemorating all the unknown, ordinary soldiers who survived, by asking them to take prints of their hands, he is making sure -- one man is making sure -- that history is not forgotten.
But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.
This building contains the world's largest collection of documents and artifacts commemorating the U.S. role in fighting on the Chinese side in that long war -- the Flying Tigers.
He has nine other buildings -- that are already open to the public -- filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary Chinese history.
Two of the most sensitive buildings include a lifetime of collection about the Cultural Revolution, a period that actually most Chinese would prefer to forget.
But he doesn't want his nation ever to forget.
These people inspire me, and they inspire me because they show us what is possible when you change the way you look at the world, change the way you look at your place in the world.
They looked outside, and then they changed what was on the inside.
They didn't go to business school.
They didn't read a manual, "How to Be a Good Leader in 10 Easy Steps."
But they have qualities we'd all recognize.
They have drive, passion, commitment.
They've gone away from what they did before, and they've gone to something they didn't know.
They've tried to connect worlds they didn't know existed before.
They've built bridges, and they've walked across them.
They have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it.
They know people have come before them and will follow them.
And they know that they're part of a whole, that they depend on other people.
It's not about them, they know that, but it has to start with them.
And they have humility.
It just happens.
But we know it doesn't just happen, don't we?
We know it takes a lot to make it happen, and we know the direction the world is going in.
So I think we need succession planning on a global basis.
We can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners, to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need.
I think it has to start with us.
And we know, just like they knew, how hard it is.
But the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along; we have models, we have examples, like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan.
We can look at what they've done, if we look.
We can learn from what they've learned.
We can change the way we see ourselves in the world.
And if we're lucky, we can change the way our great-grandchildren will answer Benki's question.
Thank you.

There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography -- women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all.
Do you know which group you're in?
If you don't, you're not alone.
Because the breast has become are very political organ.
The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press, politicians, radiologists and medical imaging companies.
I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth.
But first, my disclosures.
I am not a breast cancer survivor.
I'm not a radiologist.
I don't have any patents, and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company, and I am not seeking your vote.
What I am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about 10 years ago when a patient asked me a question.
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump.
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s.
She and I were both very pregnant at that time, and my heart just ached for her, imagining how afraid she must be.
Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign.
But she asked me a question: how confident was I that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one?
So I studied her mammogram, and I reviewed the radiology literature, and I was shocked to discover that, in her case, our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin.
You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s.
Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force, even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar with the mammography studies.
It took the Senate just 17 days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage.
Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines.
The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States issued the following quote to the Washington Post.
The radiologists were, in turn, criticized for protecting their own financial self-interest.
But in my view, the radiologists are heroes.
There's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms, and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret, and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause.
But that very fact is telling.
Where there is this much legal smoke, there is likely to be some fire.
The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density.
Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat -- pictured here in yellow -- versus connective and epithelial tissues -- pictured in pink.
And that proportion is primarily genetically determined.
Two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue, which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.
And although breast density generally declines with age, up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause.
So how do you know if your breasts are dense?
Well, you need to read the details of your mammography report.
Radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.
If the breast is less than 25 percent dense, that's called fatty-replaced.
The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities, followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense.
And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense.
The problem with breast density is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.
Both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram, and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.
So it's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast.
But imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast.
That's why mammograms find over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts, but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.
Now it's bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer, but it turns out that it's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer.
It's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.
At the time my patient posed this question to me, breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature, and very few women having mammograms, or the physicians ordering them, knew about this.
But what else could I offer her?
Mammograms have been around since the 1960's, and it's changed very little.
There have been surprisingly few innovations, until digital mammography was approved in 2000.
Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast, but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally, just like we can with a digital camera.
The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment, and what have we gained from that investment?
In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars, digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography, and in fact, it was worse in older women.
But it was better in one group, and that was women under 50 who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts, and in those women, digital mammography found twice as many cancers, but it still only found 60 percent.
So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment, but it's been a very small step forward for womankind.
What about ultrasound?
Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies, so it's not widely used.
And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors, but it's also very expensive.
If we think about disruptive technology, we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive.
Think about iPods compared to stereos.
But it's the exact opposite in health care.
The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive.
Screening the average young woman with an MRI is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.
It's just way too much equipment.
One MRI scan costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.
And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can't always come at a much higher price.
Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on innovation, and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual's genius.
Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated, if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don't ordinarily talk about.
It's like the essence of TED.
He quotes one innovator who says, "The only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick."
This makes no sense, because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don't realize have solutions.
And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don't realize are problems.
Now, take a look at this cartoon that accompanied Gladwell's article, and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers.
So if you will allow me a little creative license, I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient's problem with a physicist's solution.
Shortly after her visit, I was introduced to a nuclear physicist at Mayo named Michael O'Conner, who was a specialist in cardiac imaging, something I had nothing to do with.
And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel, where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.
Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart, and it had even been tried to image the breast.
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors.
But the potential advantage was that gamma rays, unlike X-rays, are not influenced by breast density.
But this technology could not find tumors when they're small, and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.
If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter, survival exceeds 90 percent, but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases.
But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen, and this is it.
It's made not of a bulky tube, but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector.
And I started talking to him about this problem with breast density, and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors.
So after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape -- -- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out, and we attached the new detector, and we decided to call this machine Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.
This is an image from our first patient.
And you can see, using the old gamma technology, that it just looked like noise.
But using our new detector, we could begin to see the outline of a tumor.
So here we were, a nuclear physicist, an internist, soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer, and two radiologists, and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape.
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement, but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system.
This is our current detector.
And you can see that it looks a lot different.
The duct tape is gone, and we added a second detector on top of the breast, which has further improved our tumor detection.
So how does this work?
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells, but not by normal cells, and this is the key difference from mammography.
Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue, and we've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast.
But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors, and therefore, it's impervious to breast density.
After the injection, the patient's breast is placed between the detectors.
And if you've ever had a mammogram -- if you're old enough to have had a mammogram -- you know what comes next: pain.
You may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that's regulated by federal law, and the law requires that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery come down on your breast during this study.
But with MBI, we use just light, pain-free compression.
And the detector then transmits the image to the computer.
So here's an example.
You can see, on the right, a mammogram showing a faint tumor, the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.
But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly, as well as a second tumor, which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.
In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor, we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors -- one is small as three millimeters.
Our big break came in 2004.
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors, we used these images to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.
And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1,000 women with dense breasts, comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.
Of the tumors that we found, mammography found MBI found 83 percent.
Here's an example from that screening study.
The digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue, but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake, which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.
In this case, a one-centimeter tumor.
And in this case, a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo, who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young, wanted to enroll in our study.
And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue, but her MBI showed an area of worrisome uptake, which we can also see on a color image.
And this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball.
But fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes.
So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast, we had to solve one very important problem.
We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose, and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this.
And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram.
And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study, and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram, but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.
So this is not just young women that it's benefiting.
It's also older women with dense tissue.
And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose that's used in any other type of gamma technology.
MBI generates four images per breast.
MRI generates over a thousand.
It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding.
But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image.
But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive -- it's as accurate as MRI, it's far less complex to interpret, and it's a fraction of the cost.
But you can understand why there may be forces in the breast-imaging world who prefer the status quo.
After achieving what we felt were remarkable results, our manuscript was rejected by four journals.
After the fourth rejection, we requested reconsideration of the manuscript, because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology.
Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radiology.
We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose, and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions, and this could take five or more years.
If this technology is widely adopted, I will not benefit financially in any way, and that is very important to me, because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.
But I recognize -- I recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science.
The MBI unit has now been FDA approved, but it's not yet widely available.
So until something is available for women with dense breasts, there are things that you should know to protect yourself.
First, know your density.
Ninety percent of women don't, and 95 percent of women don't know that it increases your breast cancer risk.
The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram.
I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in Chicago, and I was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is.
Of course we should.
And if you don't know, please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report.
Second, if you're pre-menopausal, try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle, when breast density is relatively lower.
Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast, insist on additional imaging.
And fourth and most important, the mammography debate will rage on, but I do believe that all women 40 and older should have an annual mammogram.
Mammography isn't perfect, but it's the only test that's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer.
But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation.
Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later, and most women, thankfully, survive.
So it takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer.
Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim.
It is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations.
We need to individualize screening based on density.
For women without dense breasts, mammography is the best choice.
But for women with dense breasts; we shouldn't abandon screening altogether, we need to offer them something better.
The babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school, and the answer has been so slow to come.
She's given me her blessing to share this story with you.
After undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer, she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy.
We can and must do better, not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters, but in time for you.
Thank you.

<title>Deborah Rhodes: A test that finds 3x more breast tumors, and why it's not available to you</title>
<description>Working with a team of physicists, Dr. Deborah Rhodes developed a new tool for tumor detection that's 3 times as effective as traditional mammograms for women with dense breast tissue. The life-saving implications are stunning. So why haven't we heard of it? Rhodes shares the story behind the tool's creation, and the web of politics and economics that keep it from mainstream use.</description>

The Kraken, a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales, and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.
In assessing the merits of such tales, it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time," and a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit."
Every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale.
Nevertheless, there are giants in the ocean, and we now have video proof, as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware.
I was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off Japan.
I'm the short one.
The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea.
I owe my participation in this now-historic event to TED.
In 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish.
I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean, one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.
Mike deGruy was also invited, and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean, and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something he's been involved with for a very long time, which is the hunt for the giant squid.
It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit, a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel that summer during Shark Week.
I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which I emphasized the importance of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.
This came out of hundreds of dives I have made, farting around in the dark using these platforms, and my impression that I saw more animals working from the submersible than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.
But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.
But I also felt like I saw more animals working with the Tiburon than the Ventana, two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems.
So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.
So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean, and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made.
The Johnson Sea-Link -- -- which you can probably just barely hear here, uses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet.
The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.
It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier.
But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the Ventana.
I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.
So for the deep sea squid hunt, I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters, no motors, just a battery-powered camera, and the only illumination coming from red light that's invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue.
That's visible to our eye, but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.
So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa, could just be thrown off the back of the ship, attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line, it would just float around passively carried by the currents, and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure, which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly, because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.
Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense.
The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish, but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it's being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.
It's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape, and a common form of defense in the deep sea.
The approach worked.
Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant, we managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.
Edith Widder : Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there.
EW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance -- now you see me, now you don't -- and we had four such teasing appearances, and then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us.
Scientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa!
EW: The full monty.
What really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e-jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it, which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.
But even more incredible was the footage shot from the Triton submersible.
What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used, a one-meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it, a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use, and I think it was this light that brought the giant in.
Now, what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light, and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.
And then he got so excited, he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better, and the giant didn't run away, so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible, bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video.
It was absolutely breathtaking, and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended, it would have been as tall as a two-story house.
How could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?
We've only explored about five percent of our ocean.
There are great discoveries yet to be made down there, fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.
Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we've spent on space exploration.
We need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration, because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on Earth.
We need — thank you.
Exploration is the engine that drives innovation.
Innovation drives economic growth.
So let's all go exploring, but let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away, or, as Mike deGruy once said, "If you want to get away from it all and see something you've never seen, or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen, get in a sub."
He should have been with us for this adventure.
We miss him.

So as a fashion designer, I've always tended to think of materials something like this, or this, or maybe this.
But then I met a biologist, and now I think of materials like this -- green tea, sugar, a few microbes and a little time.
I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe, which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms, which spin cellulose in a fermentation process.
Over time, these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface.
So we start by brewing the tea.
I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time, and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar.
We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath.
We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below 30 degrees C.
And then we're ready to add the living organism.
And along with that, some acetic acid.
And once you get this process going, you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid.
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.
And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it.
And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside.
So this is my mini fabric farm.
After about three days, the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.
So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing.
And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid.
So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose.
And they're sticking together, forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface.
After about two to three weeks, we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness.
So the bath on the left is after five days, and on the right, after 10.
And this is a static culture.
You don't have to do anything to it; you just literally watch it grow.
It doesn't need light.
And when it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold, soapy water.
At this point, it's really heavy.
It's over 90 percent water, so we need to let that evaporate.
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.
Again, you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air.
And as it's drying, it's compressing, so what you're left with, depending on the recipe, is something that's either like a really light-weight, transparent paper, or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.
And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally, or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape.
And as it evaporates, it will knit itself together, forming seams.
So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea.
I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin, which intrigues me.
Since it's organic, I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.
I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation.
Using fruit and vegetable staining, create organic patterning.
And using indigo, make it anti-microbial.
And in fact, cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark.
And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose, it just takes one, and a really short one at that.
What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant.
So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today, I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water.
The dress would get really heavy, and eventually the seams would probably fall apart -- leaving me feeling rather naked.
Possibly a good performance piece, but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.
What I'm looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need.
So what I want to do is say to a future bug, "Spin me a thread.
Align it in this direction.
Make it hydrophobic.
And while you're at it, just form it around this 3D shape."
Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing, and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels, possibly even replacement bone tissue.
But with synthetic biology, we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality, quantity and shape of material that we desire.
Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting because then I start to think, wow, we could actually imagine growing consumable products.
What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency.
So we only grow what we need.
There's no waste.
And in fact, we could make it from a waste stream -- so for example, a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant.
Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings.
What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton, leather or other textile materials.
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources.
Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact.
We could, for example, imagine growing a lamp, a chair, a car or maybe even a house.
So I guess what my question to you is: in the future, what would you choose to grow?
Thank you very much.
Suzanne, just a curiosity, what you're wearing is not random.
This is one of the jackets you grew?
SL: Yes, it is.
It's probably -- part of the project's still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.
It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it.
Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.
Suzanne Lee.

Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day: our shoes, our handbags, our computers and cell phones.
Now, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt.
Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes, or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your iPad.
We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make, and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves.
After all, what's wrong with a world in which a worker on an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one?
It's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive, and that it's our desire for cheap goods that makes them so.
So, this simple narrative equating Western demand and Chinese suffering is appealing, especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world, but it's also inaccurate and disrespectful.
We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways.
In fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world, including its own, thanks to a combination of factors: its low costs, its large and educated workforce, and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands.
By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets, we have rendered the individuals on the other end into invisibility, as tiny and interchangeable as the parts of a mobile phone.
Chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for iPods.
They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money, to learn new skills, and to see the world.
In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves.
Here are a few.
Bao Yongxiu: "My mother tells me to come home and get married, but if I marry now, before I have fully developed myself, I can only marry an ordinary worker, so I'm not in a rush."
Chen Ying: "When I went home for the new year, everyone said I had changed. They asked me, what did you do that you have changed so much?
I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them more, they won't understand anyway."
Wu Chunming: "Even if I make a lot of money, it won't satisfy me.
Just to make money is not enough meaning in life."
Xiao Jin: "Now, after I get off work, I study English, because in the future, our customers won't be only Chinese, so we must learn more languages."
All of these speakers, by the way, are young women, 18 or 19 years old.
So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan.
Certain subjects came up over and over: how much money they made, what kind of husband they hoped to marry, whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were.
Other subjects came up almost never, including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life: 10 or 15 workers in one room, 50 people sharing a single bathroom, days and nights ruled by the factory clock.
Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances, and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural China.
The workers rarely spoke about the products they made, and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did.
When I asked Lu Qingmin, the young woman I got to know best, what exactly she did on the factory floor, she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like "qiu xi."
Only much later did I realize that she had been saying "QC," or quality control.
She couldn't even tell me what she did on the factory floor.
All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn't even understand.
Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism, the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor.
Unlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets, the worker in an industrial factory has no control, no pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work.
But like so many theories that Marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the British Museum, he got this one wrong.
Just because a person spends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that, a piece of something.
What she does with the money she earns, what she learns in that place, and how it changes her, these are the things that matter.
What a factory makes is never the point, and the workers could not care less who buys their products.
Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories, on the other hand, plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make.
Many articles calculate: How long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he's making?
For example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out two and a half months' wages for an iPhone.
But how meaningful is this calculation, really?
For example, I recently wrote an article in The New Yorker magazine, but I can't afford to buy an ad in it.
But, who cares? I don't want an ad in The New Yorker, and most of these workers don't really want iPhones.
Their calculations are different.
How long should I stay in this factory?
How much money can I save?
How much will it take to buy an apartment or a car, to get married, or to put my child through school?
The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor.
About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min, she invited me home to her family village for the Chinese New Year.
On the train home, she gave me a present: a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.
I thanked her, assuming it was fake, like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan.
After we got home, Min gave her mother another present: a pink Dooney &amp; Bourke handbag, and a few nights later, her sister was showing off a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag.
Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags were made by their factory, and every single one of them was authentic.
Min's sister said to her parents, "In America, this bag sells for 320 dollars."
Her parents, who are both farmers, looked on, speechless.
"And that's not all -- Coach is coming out with a new line, 2191," she said. "One bag will sell for 6,000."
She paused and said, "I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or 6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000."
Min's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her for the new year, said, "It doesn't look like it's worth that much."
Min's sister turned to him and said, "Some people actually understand these things. You don't understand shit."
In Min's world, the Coach bags had a curious currency.
They weren't exactly worthless, but they were nothing close to the actual value, because almost no one they knew wanted to buy one, or knew how much it was worth.
Once, when Min's older sister's friend got married, she brought a handbag along as a wedding present.
Another time, after Min had already left the handbag factory, her younger sister came to visit, bringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts.
I looked in the zippered pocket of one, and I found a printed card in English, which read, "An American classic.
In 1941, the burnished patina of an all-American baseball glove inspired the founder of Coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather.
Six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair.
They were fresh, functional, and women everywhere adored them. A new American classic was born."
I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min and her sisters.
Their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated, surprising and funny than he could have imagined.
And yet, his view of the world persists, and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses, to imagine that we can know what they're really thinking.
The first time I met Min, she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory.
Over the next two years, I watched as she switched jobs five times, eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory.
Later, she married a fellow migrant worker, moved with him to his village, gave birth to two daughters, and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick for herself and an apartment for her parents.
She recently returned to Dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes, temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village.
In a recent email to me, she explained, "A person should have some ambition while she is young so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose."
Across China, there are 150 million workers like her, one third of them women, who have left their villages to work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants and the construction sites of the big cities.
Together, they make up the largest migration in history, and it is globalization, this chain that begins in a Chinese farming village and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet and Coach handbags on our arms that has changed the way these millions of people work and marry and live and think.
Very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be.
When I first went to Dongguan, I worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers.
I also worried that nothing would ever happen to them, or that they would have nothing to say to me.
Instead, I found young women who were smart and funny and brave and generous.
By opening up their lives to me, they taught me so much about factories and about China and about how to live in the world.
This is the Coach purse that Min gave me on the train home to visit her family.
I keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women I wrote about, ties that are not economic but personal in nature, measured not in money but in memories.
This purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine, sitting in your office or in the library, are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world.
Thank you.
Thank you, Leslie, that was an insight that a lot of us haven't had before.
But I'm curious. If you had a minute, say, with Apple's head of manufacturing, what would you say?
Leslie Chang: One minute?
One minute.
LC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers is how much they're self-motivated, self-driven, resourceful, and the thing that struck me, what they want most is education, to learn, because most of them come from very poor backgrounds.
They usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade.
Their parents are often illiterate, and then they come to the city, and they, on their own, at night, during the weekends, they'll take a computer class, they'll take an English class, and learn really, really rudimentary things, you know, like how to type a document in Word, or how to say really simple things in English.
So, if you really want to help these workers, start these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes in these schools, and what's going to happen is, all your workers are going to move on, but hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple, and you can help their social mobility and their self-improvement.
When you talk to workers, that's what they want.
They do not say, "I want better hot water in the showers.
I want a nicer room. I want a TV set."
I mean, it would be nice to have those things, but that's not why they're in the city, and that's not what they care about.
Was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth, that things over time were getting better?
LC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know, it was interesting, because I spent basically two years hanging out in this city, Dongguan, and over that time, you could see immense change in every person's life: upward, downward, sideways, but generally upward.
If you spend enough time, it's upward, and I met people who had moved to the city 10 years ago, and who are now basically urban middle class people, so the trajectory is definitely upward.
It's just hard to see when you're suddenly sucked into the city. It looks like everyone's poor and desperate, but that's not really how it is.
Certainly, the factory conditions are really tough, and it's nothing you or I would want to do, but from their perspective, where they're coming from is much worse, and where they're going is hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give that context of what's going on in their minds, not what necessarily is going on in yours.
Thanks so much for your talk.
Thank you very much.

<title>Leslie T. Chang: The voices of China's workers</title>
<description>In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's been missing is the voices of workers -- the millions of people who migrate to factories in China and other emerging countries to make goods sold all over the world. Reporter Leslie T. Chang sought out women who work in one of China's booming megacities, and tells their stories.</description>

Today, I want you to look at children who become suicide bombers through a completely different lens.
In 2009, there were 500 bomb blasts across Pakistan.
I spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bombers and with Taliban recruiters, trying to understand how the Taliban were converting these children into live ammunition and why these children were actively signing up to their cause.
I want you to watch a short video from my latest documentary film, "Children of the Taliban."
The Taliban now run their own schools.
They target poor families and convince the parents to send their children.
In return, they provide free food and shelter and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend.
We've obtained a propaganda video made by the Taliban.
Young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies.
I made contact with a child from Swat who studied in a madrassa like this.
Hazrat Ali is from a poor farming family in Swat.
He joined the Taliban a year ago when he was 13.
How do the Taliban in your area get people to join them?
Hazrat Ali: They first call us to the mosque and preach to us.
Then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the Koran.
Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy: He tells me that children are then given months of military training.
H They teach us to use machine guns, Kalashnikov, rocket launchers, grenades, bombs.
They ask us to use them only against the infidels.
Then they teach us to do a suicide attack.
SOC: Would you like to carry out a suicide attack?
H If God gives me strength.
SOC: I, in my research, have seen that the Taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children, and I think it's a five-step process.
Step one is that the Taliban prey on families that are large, that are poor, that live in rural areas.
They separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food, clothing, shelter to these children.
Then they ship them off, hundreds of miles away to hard-line schools that run along the Taliban agenda.
Step two: They teach the children the Koran, which is Islam's holiest book, in Arabic, a language these children do not understand and cannot speak.
They rely very heavily on teachers, who I have personally seen distort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose to.
These children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers, listening to radio, reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them.
If any child is found violating these rules, he is severely reprimanded.
Effectively, the Taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children.
Step three: The Taliban want these children to hate the world that they currently live in.
So they beat these children -- I have seen it; they feed them twice a day dried bread and water; they rarely allow them to play games; they tell them that, for eight hours at a time, all they have to do is read the Koran.
The children are virtual prisoners; they cannot leave, they cannot go home.
Their parents are so poor, they have no resources to get them back.
Step four: The older members of the Taliban, the fighters, start talking to the younger boys about the glories of martyrdom.
They talk to them about how when they die, they will be received up with lakes of honey and milk, how there will be 72 virgins waiting for them in paradise, how there will be unlimited food, and how this glory is going to propel them to become heroes in their neighborhoods.
Effectively, this is the brainwashing process that has begun.
Step five: I believe the Taliban have one of the most effective means of propaganda.
Their videos that they use are intercut with photographs of men and women and children dying in Iraq and Afghanistan and in Pakistan.
And the basic message is that the Western powers do not care about civilian deaths, so those people who live in areas and support governments that work with Western powers are fair game.
That's why Pakistani civilians, over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone, are fair game.
Now these children are primed to become suicide bombers.
They're ready to go out and fight because they've been told that this is effectively their only way to glorify Islam.
I want you to watch another excerpt from the film.
This boy is called Zenola.
He blew himself up, killing six.
This boy is called Sadik.
He killed 22.
This boy is called Messoud.
He killed 28.
The Taliban are running suicide schools, preparing a generation of boys for atrocities against civilians.
Do you want to carry out a suicide attack?
Boy: I would love to.
But only if I get permission from my dad.
When I look at suicide bombers younger than me, or my age, I get so inspired by their terrific attacks.
SOC: What blessing would you get from carrying out a suicide attack?
Boy: On the day of judgment, God will ask me, "Why did you do that?"
I will answer, "My Lord! Only to make you happy!
I have laid down my life fighting the infidels."
Then God will look at my intention.
If my intention was to eradicate evil for Islam, then I will be rewarded with paradise.
Singer: On the day of judgment My God will call me My body will be put back together And God will ask me why I did this SOC: I leave you all with this thought: If you grew up in these circumstances, faced with these choices, would you choose to live in this world or in the glorious afterlife?
As one Taliban recruiter told me, "There will always be sacrificial lambs in this war."
Thank you.

Two years ago here at TED I reported that we had discovered at Saturn, with the Cassini Spacecraft, an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon Enceladus, seen here.
This region seen here for the first time in the Cassini image taken in 2005. This is the south polar region, with the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole.
And seen just recently in late 2008, here is that region again, now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter.
And I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery -- this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole, consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane.
And at that time two years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers, and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface, but we weren't really sure.
However, the implications of those results -- of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry, and perhaps life itself -- were so exciting that, in the intervening two years, we have focused more on Enceladus.
We've flown the Cassini Spacecraft by this moon now several times, flying closer and deeper into these jets, into the denser regions of these jets, so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements.
And we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported.
While they're not amino acids, we're now finding things like propane and benzene, hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde.
And the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water, which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from pockets of liquid water, but that that liquid water is in contact with rock.
And that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life.
So we are very encouraged by these results.
And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon, under the south pole, an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms.
Whether or not there are living organisms there, of course, is an entirely different matter.
And that will have to await the arrival, back at Enceladus, of the spacecrafts, hopefully some time in the near future, specifically equipped to address that particular question.
But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnine system, and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park, just because we can.
Thank you.

It is actually a reality today that you can download products from the Web -- product data, I should say, from the Web -- perhaps tweak it and personalize it to your own preference or your own taste, and have that information sent to a desktop machine that will fabricate it for you on the spot.
We can actually build for you, very rapidly, a physical object.
And the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called additive manufacturing, or 3D printing.
This is a 3D printer.
They have been around for almost 30 years now, which is quite amazing to think of, but they're only just starting to filter into the public arena.
And typically, you would take data, like the data of a pen here, which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3D, and we would pass that data with material into a machine.
And a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that product would be built.
And we can take out the physical product, and ready to use, or to, perhaps, assemble into something else.
But if these machines have been around for almost 30 years, why don't we know about them?
Because typically they've been too inefficient, inaccessible, they've not been fast enough, they've been quite expensive.
But today, it is becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful.
Many barriers are breaking down.
That means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines, if not this minute.
And it will change and disrupt the landscape of manufacturing, and most certainly our lives, our businesses and the lives of our children.
So how does it work?
It typically reads CAD data, which is a product design data created on professional product design programs.
And here you can see an engineer -- it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer -- create a product in 3D.
And this data gets sent to a machine that slices the data into two-dimensional representations of that product all the way through -- almost like slicing it like salami.
And that data, layer by layer, gets passed through the machine, starting at the base of the product and depositing material, layer upon layer, infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer in an additive process.
And this material that's deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form.
And the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting.
In this case, we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS.
It's actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer.
And over time -- quite rapidly actually, in a number of hours -- we can build a physical product, ready to take out of the machine and use.
And this is quite an extraordinary idea, but it is reality today.
So all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way.
They were all 3D printed.
And you can see, they're ranging from shoes, rings that were made out of stainless steal, phone covers out of plastic, all the way through to spinal implants, for example, that were created out of medical-grade titanium, and engine parts.
But what you'll notice about all of these products is they're very, very intricate.
The design is quite extraordinary.
Because we're taking this data in 3D form, slicing it up before it gets past the machine, we can actually create structures that are more intricate than any other manufacturing technology -- or, in fact, are impossible to build in any other way.
And you can create parts with moving components, hinges, parts within parts.
So in some cases, we can abolish totally the need for manual labor.
It sounds great.
It is great.
We can have 3D printers today that build structures like these.
This is almost three meters high.
And this was built by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer in layers of about five millimeters to 10 mm in thickness -- slowly growing this structure.
This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro.
And you can actually walk into it.
And on the other end of the spectrum, this is a microstructure.
It's created depositing layers of about four microns.
So really the resolution is quite incredible.
The detail that you can get today is quite amazing.
So who's using it?
Typically, because we can create products very rapidly, it's been used by product designers, or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and very quickly create or reiterate a design.
And actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well is that you can create bespoke products en masse.
There's very little economies of scale.
So you can now create one-offs very easily.
Architects, for example, they want to create prototypes of buildings.
Again you can see, this is a building of the Free University in Berlin and it was designed by Foster and Partners.
Again, not buildable in any other way.
And very hard to even create this by hand.
Now this is an engine component.
It was developed by a company called Within Technologies and 3T RPD.
It's very, very, very detailed inside with the design.
Now 3D printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production.
If we slice into this product which is actually sitting here, you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it, which means it's a more efficient product.
You can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques even if you tried to do it manually.
It's more efficient because we can now create all these cavities within the object that cool fluid.
And it's used by aerospace and automotive.
It's a lighter part and it uses less material waste.
So it's overall performance and efficiency just exceeds standard mass produced products.
And then taking this idea of creating a very detailed structure, we can apply it to honeycomb structures and use them within implants.
Typically an implant is more effective within the body if it's more porous, because our body tissue will grow into it.
There's a lower chance of rejection.
But it's very hard to create that in standard ways.
With 3D printing, we're seeing today that we can create much better implants.
And in fact, because we can create bespoke products en masse, one-offs, we can create implants that are specific to individuals.
So as you can see, this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic.
And we're starting to see it being used for final end products.
And in fact, as the detail is improving, the quality is improving, the price of the machines are falling and they're becoming quicker.
They're also now small enough to sit on a desktop.
You can buy a machine today for about $300 that you can create yourself, which is quite incredible.
But then it begs the question, why don't we all have one in our home?
Because, simply, most of us here today don't know how to create the data that a 3D printer reads.
If I gave you a 3D printer, you wouldn't know how to direct it to make what you want it to.
But there are more and more technologies, software and processes today that are breaking down those barriers.
I believe we're at a tipping point where this is now something that we can't avoid.
This technology is really going to disrupt the landscape of manufacturing and, I believe, cause a revolution in manufacturing.
So today, you can download products from the Web -- anything you would have on your desktop, like pens, whistles, lemon squeezers.
You can use software like Google SketchUp to create products from scratch very easily.
3D printing can be also used to download spare parts from the Web.
So imagine you have, say, a Hoover in your home and it has broken down. You need a spare part, but you realize that Hoover's been discontinued.
Can you imagine going online -- this is a reality -- and finding that spare part from a database of geometries of that discontinued product and downloading that information, that data, and having the product made for you at home, ready to use, on your demand?
And in fact, because we can create spare parts with things the machines are quite literally making themselves.
You're having machines fabricate themselves.
These are parts of a RepRap machine, which is a kind of desktop printer.
But what interests my company the most is the fact that you can create individual unique products en masse.
There's no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be injection molded in China.
You can just make it physically on the spot.
Which means that we can now present to the public the next generation of customization.
This is something that is now possible today, that you can direct personally how you want your products to look.
We're all familiar with the idea of customization or personalization.
Brands like Nike are doing it.
It's all over the Web.
In fact, every major household name is allowing you to interact with their products all the way from Smart Cars to Prada to Ray Ban, for example.
But this is not really mass customization; it's known as variant production, variations of the same product.
What you could do is really influence your product now and shape-manipulate your product.
I'm not sure about you guys, but I've had experiences when I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted and I've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp that I know where I want to sit in my house and I just can't find the right thing, or that perfect piece of jewelry as a gift or for myself.
Imagine that you can now engage with a brand and interact, so that you can pass your personal attributes to the products that you're about to buy.
You can today download a product with software like this, view the product in 3D.
This is the sort of 3D data that a machine will read.
This is a lamp.
And you can start iterating the design.
You can direct what color that product will be, perhaps what material.
And also, you can engage in shape manipulation of that product, but within boundaries that are safe.
Because obviously the public are not professional product designers.
The piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible.
And when somebody is ready to purchase the product in their personalized design, they click "Enter" and this data gets converted into the data that a 3D printer reads and gets passed to a 3D printer, perhaps on someone's desktop.
But I don't think that that's immediate.
I don't think that will happen soon.
What's more likely, and we're seeing it today, is that data gets sent to a local manufacturing center.
This means lower carbon footprint.
We're now, instead of shipping a product across the world, we're sending data across the Internet.
Here's the product being built.
You can see, this came out of the machine in one piece and the electronics were inserted later.
It's this lamp, as you can see here.
So as long as you have the data, you can create the part on demand.
And you don't necessarily need to use this for just aesthetic customization, you can use it for functional customization, scanning parts of the body and creating things that are made to fit.
So we can run this through to something like prosthetics, which is highly specialized to an individual's handicap.
Or we can create very specific prosthetics for that individual.
Scanning teeth today, you can have your teeth scanned and dental coatings made in this way to fit you.
While you wait at the dentist, a machine will quietly be creating this for you ready to insert in the teeth.
And the idea of now creating implants, scanning data, an MRI scan of somebody can now be converted into 3D data and we can create very specific implants for them.
And applying this to the idea of building up what's in our bodies.
You know, this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree.
It's very intricate.
You couldn't really create this or simulate it in any other way.
But with MRI data, we can just build the product, as you can see, very intricately.
Using this process, pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today.
So one of the pioneers, for example, is Dr. Anthony Atala, and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts -- bladders, valves, kidneys.
Now this is not something that's ready for the public, but it is in working progress.
So just to finalize, we're all individual.
We all have different preferences, different needs.
We like different things.
We're all different sizes and our companies the same.
Businesses want different things.
Without a doubt in my mind, I believe that this technology is going to cause a manufacturing revolution and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it.
Thank you.

I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years, and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?
So often, we look at dollar terms -- people making less than a dollar or two or three a day.
And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at income as only one variable.
Because really, it's a condition about choice, and the lack of freedom.
And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that I have.
It was in Kenya, and I want to share it with you.
I was with my friend Susan Meiselas, the photographer, in the Mathare Valley slums.
Now, Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa.
It's about three miles out of Nairobi, and it's a mile long and about two-tenths of a mile wide, where over half a million people live crammed in these little tin shacks, generation after generation, renting them, often eight or 10 people to a room.
And it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs: a hard place to grow up.
And when we were walking through the narrow alleys, it was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes.
But at the same time it was also impossible not to see the human vitality, the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there: women washing their babies, washing their clothes, hanging them out to dry.
I met this woman, Mama Rose, who has rented that little tin shack for 32 years, where she lives with her seven children.
Four sleep in one twin bed, and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor.
And she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk, and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside.
It was also the day after the inauguration, and I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe.
And I would see kids on the street corners, and they'd say "Obama, he's our brother!"
And I'd say "Well, Obama's my brother, so that makes you my brother too."
And they would look quizzically, and then be like, "High five!"
And it was here that I met Jane.
I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face, and I asked her to tell me her story.
She started off by telling me her dream. She said, "I had two.
My first dream was to be a doctor, and the second was to marry a good man who would stay with me and my family, because my mother was a single mom, and couldn't afford to pay for school fees.
So I had to give up the first dream, and I focused on the second."
She got married when she was 18, had a baby right away.
And when she turned 20, found herself pregnant with a second child, her mom died and her husband left her -- married another woman.
So she was again in Mathare, with no income, no skill set, no money.
And so she ultimately turned to prostitution.
It wasn't organized in the way we often think of it.
She would go into the city at night with about 20 girls, look for work, and sometimes come back with a few shillings, or sometimes with nothing.
And she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all."
In 2001, her life changed.
She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization, Jamii Bora, that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were, as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings.
And so she spent a year to save 50 dollars, and started borrowing, and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine.
She started tailoring.
And that turned into what she does now, which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets, and for about three dollars and 25 cents she buys an old ball gown.
Some of them might be ones you gave.
And she repurposes them with frills and ribbons, and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women for their daughter's Sweet 16 or first Holy Communion -- those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate all along the economic spectrum.
And she does really good business. In fact, I watched her walk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it, there was a crowd of women around her, buying these dresses.
And I reflected, as I was watching her sell the dresses, and also the jewelry that she makes, that now Jane makes more than four dollars a day.
And by many definitions she is no longer poor.
But she still lives in Mathare Valley.
And so she can't move out.
She lives with all of that insecurity, and in fact, in January, during the ethnic riots, she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack in which she would live.
Jamii Bora understands that and understands that when we're talking about poverty, we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum.
And so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations, loans and investments that will go the long term with them, they built a low-cost housing development, about an hour outside Nairobi central.
And they designed it from the perspective of customers like Jane herself, insisting on responsibility and accountability.
So she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage -- of the total value, or about 400 dollars in savings.
And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty.
And in the next couple of weeks, she's going to be among the first 200 families to move into this development.
When I asked her if she feared anything, or whether she would miss anything from Mathare, she said, "What would I fear that I haven't confronted already?
I'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all."
And she said, "What would I miss?
You think I will miss the violence or the drugs? The lack of privacy?
Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home at the end of the day?" She said "If you gave me 10 minutes my bags would be packed."
I said, "Well what about your dreams?"
And she said, "Well, you know, my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl.
But if I think about it, I thought I wanted a husband, but what I really wanted was a family that was loving. And I fiercely love my children, and they love me back."
She said, "I thought that I wanted to be a doctor, but what I really wanted to be was somebody who served and healed and cured.
And so I feel so blessed with everything that I have, that two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients.
And I say, 'Look at me. You are not dead.
You are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'" And she said, "I'm not a doctor who gives out pills.
But maybe me, I give out something better because I give them hope."
And in the middle of this economic crisis, where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear, I think we're well suited to take a cue from Jane and reach out, recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary.
Because when systems are broken, like the ones that we're seeing around the world, it's an opportunity for invention and for innovation.
It's an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to all human beings, so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves.
I truly believe it's where dignity starts.
We owe it to the Janes of the world.
And just as important, we owe it to ourselves.
Thank you.

I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper.
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change, and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog.
They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science.
Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system.
That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries.
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic.
And all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers, from 113 countries.
It's a big community. It's such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world.
Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that.
And every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics.
For us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I happen to study.
And in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more, there are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics, things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules.
And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it.
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene.
But despite its very small weight, enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet.
It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane.
And because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system.
Because it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing.
We blow it up and look at the pieces.
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.
Atmospheric explosions, or full combustion, takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car.
But still, we look at the pieces.
We run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do.
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales.
And it takes weeks to perform our integrations.
And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening.
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing.
I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia. There are others.
We found a global atmospheric watchtower there, in the middle of the rainforest, and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower, to look for isoprene, and of course, other things while we were there.
This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest, from above.
And this is the tower from below.
And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us.
And this plane, the model, BA146, which was run by FAAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people.
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today.
But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff.
We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements.
We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering.
We have to get special flight clearance.
And as you come around the banks in these valleys, the forces can get up to two Gs.
And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board.
So, as you can imagine, the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation.
It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule.
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule.
And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule, they write one scientific paper on the subject.
And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules.
And as a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection, or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others.
And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections.
So you can imagine the scale of the effort.
In each one of those assessments that we write, we always tag on a summary, and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience.
And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers, in order to make headlines like these.
Thank you very much.

What I am always thinking about is what this session is about, which is called simplicity.
And almost, I would almost call it being simple-minded, but in the best sense of the word.
I'm trying to figure out two very simple things: how to live and how to die, period.
That's all I'm trying to do, all day long.
And I'm also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks, and, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal things that keep you grounded.
So, I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child.
My older sister was busy torturing my parents, and they were busy torturing her.
I was lucky enough to be completely ignored, which is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you.
So, I was able to completely daydream my way through my life.
And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU, at a very good time, in 1967, where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU.
And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him.
And feminists hated us, and the whole thing was wretched from beginning to end.
But I kept writing bad poetry, and he didn't blow up the math building, but he went to Cuba.
But I gave him the money, because I was from Riverdale so I had more money than he did.
And that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause.
But, then he came back, and things happened, and I decided I really hated my writing, that it was awful, awful, purple prose.
And I decided that I wanted to tell -- but I still wanted to tell a narrative story and I still wanted to tell my stories.
So I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be?
And so what happened was that I started just becoming an editorial illustrator through, you know, sheer whatever, sheer ignorance.
And we started a studio.
Well, Tibor really started the studio, called M&amp;Co.
And the premise of M&amp;Co was, we don't know anything, but that's all right, we're going to do it anyway.
And as a matter of fact, it's better not to know anything, because if you know too much, you're stymied.
So, the premise in the studio was, there are no boundaries, there is no fear.
And I -- and my full-time job, I landed the best job on Earth, was to daydream, and to actually come up with absurd ideas that -- fortunately, there were enough people there, and it was a team, it was a collective, it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas.
But the point was that I was there as myself, as a dreamer.
And so some of the things -- I mean, it was a long history of M&amp;Co, and clearly we also needed to make some money, so we decided we would create a series of products.
And some of the watches there, attempting to be beautiful and humorous -- maybe not attempting, hopefully succeeding.
That to be able to talk about content, to break apart what you normally expect, to use humor and surprise, elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us.
It was a very high, it was a very impersonal time in design and we wanted to say, the content is what's important, not the package, not the wrapping.
You really have to be journalists, you have to be inventors, you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything.
So, the good news is that I have a dog and, though I don't know if I believe in luck -- I don't know what I believe in, it's a very complicated question, but I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times.
So, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house, because everybody's always, you know, leaving, they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail, and he runs to the other room.
But I am able to make the transition from working for children and -- from working for adults to children, and back and forth, because, you know, I can say that I'm immature, and in a way, that's true.
I don't really -- I mean, I could tell you that I didn't understand, I'm not proud of it, but I didn't understand let's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference.
But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann's talk.
And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk.
So, good things come out of, you know, incomprehension -- -- which I will do a painting of, and then it will end up in my work.
So, I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new.
So, in writing for children, it seems simple, and it is.
You have to condense a story into 32 pages, usually.
And what you have to do is, you really have to edit down to what you want to say.
And hopefully, you're not talking down to kids and you're not talking in such a way that you, you know, couldn't stand reading it after one time.
So, I hopefully am writing, you know, books that are good for children and for adults.
But the painting reflects -- I don't think differently for children than I do for adults.
I try to use the same kind of imagination, the same kind of whimsy, the same kind of love of language.
So, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends.
This is Andrew Gatz, and he walked in through the door and I said, "You! Sit down there." You know, I take lots of photos.
And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair.
So, I get to put in all of the things that I love.
Hopefully, a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels, and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve.
And the books are really journals of my life.
I never -- I don't like plots.
I don't know what a plot means.
I can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning, you know, beginning, middle and end. It really scares me, because my life is too random and too confused, and I enjoy it that way.
But anyway, so we were in Venice, and this is our room. And I had this dream that I was wearing this fantastic green gown, and I was looking out the window, and it was really a beautiful thing.
And so, I was able to put that into this story, which is an alphabet, and hopefully go on to something else.
The letter C had other things in it.
I was fortunate also, to meet the man who's sitting on the bed, though I gave him hair over here and he doesn't have hair.
Well, he has some hair but -- well, he used to have hair.
And with him, I was able to do a project that was really fantastic.
I work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happened and it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it.
And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx, and somebody said Bronxistan, and somebody said Ferreristan, and we came up with this New Yorker cover, which we were able to -- we didn't know what we were doing.
We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be -- well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true.
We hoped we'd be funny, but we didn't know it would be a cover, and we didn't know that that image, at the moment that it happened, would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people.
And it really became the -- I don't know, you know, it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on.
And from, you know, Fattushis, to Taxistan to, you know, for the Fashtoonks, Botoxia, Pashmina, Khlintunisia, you know, we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign, who are -- what's going on over here?
Who are these people? What are these tribes?
And David Remnick, who was really wonderful about it, had one problem. He didn't like Al Zheimers, because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's.
But you know, we said, "David, who's going to know?
They're not."
So it stayed in, and it was, and, you know, it was a good thing.
You know, in the course of my life, I never know what's going to happen and that's kind of the beauty part.
And we were on Cape Cod, a place, obviously, of great inspiration, and I picked up this book, "The Elements of Style," at a yard sale.
And I didn't -- and I'd never used it in school, because I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out, and I don't know what, sitting in cafes.
But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought, this book is amazing.
I said, people should know about this book.
So I decided it needed a few -- it needed a lift, it needed a few illustrations.
And basically, I called the, you know, I convinced the White Estate, and what an intersection of like, you know, Polish Jew, you know, main WASP family. Here I am, saying, I'd like to do something to this book.
And they said yes, and they left me completely alone, which was a gorgeous, wonderful thing.
And I took the examples that they gave, and just did 56 paintings, basically.
So, this is, I don't know if you can read this.
"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in."
And when you're dealing with grammar, which is, you know, incredibly dry, E.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical -- and actually, Strunk -- and then you come to the rules and, you know, there are lots of grammar things. "Do you mind me asking a question?
Do you mind my asking a question?"
"Would, could, should, or would, should, could."
And "would" is Coco Chanel's lover, "should" is Edith Sitwell, and "could" is an August Sander subject.
And, "He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug."
So, there's a kind of British understatement, murder-mystery theme that I really love very much.
And then, "Be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand."
E.B. White wrote us a number of rules, which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him for the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do, or you can, I don't know what, you know, eat a sandwich.
So, what I did when I was painting was I started singing, because I really adore singing, and I think that music is the highest form of all art.
So, I commissioned a wonderful composer, Nico Muhly, who wrote nine songs using the text, and we performed this fantastic evening of -- he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.
I played the clattering teacup and the slinky in the main reading room of the New York Public Library, where you're supposed to be very, very quiet, and it was a phenomenally wonderful event, which we hopefully will do some more.
Who knows? The New York TimesSelect, the op-ed page, asked me to do a column, and they said, you can do whatever you want.
So, once a month for the last year, I've been doing a column called "The Principles of Uncertainty," which, you know, I don't know who Heisenberg is, but I know I can throw that around now. You know, it's the principles of uncertainty, so, you know.
I'm going to read quickly -- and probably I'm going to edit some, because I don't have that much time left -- a few of the columns.
And basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing, because I said, "Well, how much space do I have?"
And they said, "Well, you know, it's the Internet."
And I said, "Yes, but how much space do I have?"
And they said, "It's unlimited, it's unlimited."
OK. So, the first one I was very timid, and I'll begin.
"How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?
Impossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo."
And I talk about the dodo, and how the dodo became extinct, and then I talk about Spinoza.
"As the last dodo was dying, Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything, called eudaemonia.
And then he breathed his last, with loved ones around him, and I know that he had chicken soup also, as his last meal."
I happen to know it for a fact.
And then he died, and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct.
And then, we don't have a stuffed Spinoza, but we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog, and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg, in Russia.
And there he is, with this horrible electrical box on his rump in this fantastic, decrepit palace.
"And I think it must have been a very, very dark day when the Bolsheviks arrived.
Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs, but Stalin was a paranoid man, even more than my father."
You don't even know.
"And decided his top people had to be extinctified."
Which I think I made up, which is a good thing.
And so, this is a chart of, you know, just a small chart, because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed.
So, shot dead, smacked over the head, you know, thrown away.
"Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov, sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair, leafing through a book and butterflies, imagine such displacement, such loss?"
And then I want to tell you that this is a map.
So, "My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well.
Too many pogroms.
Leaving the shack, the wild blueberry woods, the geese, the River Sluch, they went to Palestine and then America."
And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America, and that is my DNA over here, because that person who I grew up with had no use for facts whatsoever.
Facts were actually banished from our home.
And so, if you see that Texas -- you know, Texas and California are under Canada, and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina, this is the home that I grew up in, OK?
So, it's a miracle that I'm here today.
But actually, it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing.
But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin, which is the town they came from, and, "Sorry, the rest unknown, thank you."
But in her lexicon, "sorry, the rest unknown, thank you" is "sorry, the rest unknown, go to hell," because she couldn't care less.
"The Impossibility of February" is that February's a really wretched month in New York and the images for me conjure up these really awful things.
Well, not so awful.
I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead.
And I say, "I hope he's not really dead, just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow, but the caption says he is dead."
And actually, he was. I think he's dead, though I don't know, maybe he's not dead.
"And this woman leans over in anguish, not about that man, but about all sad things. It happens quite often in February."
There's consoling.
This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase, and basically -- you know, I guess onions are a theme here.
And he says, "It is impossible not to lie.
It is February and not lying is impossible."
And I really spend a lot of time wondering, how much truth do we tell?
What is it that we're actually -- what story are we actually telling?
How do we know when we are ourselves?
How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories, you know, are real sentences?
Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying?
I'm going to quickly go through this.
A quote by Bertrand Russell, "All the labor of all the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction.
So now, my friends, if that is true, and it is true, what is the point?"
A complicated question.
And so, you know, I talk to my friends and I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs.
Oh my God, you know what?
Could we have -- no, we don't have time.
I taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the -- you know, could we have it for a second?
Do you have that?
OK. I taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about 85.
So -- and that's a song about how everybody's miserable because, you know, we're from Russia.
I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart, and she is 96, and when I brought her a copy of "The Elements of Style," she said she would treasure it.
And then I said -- oh, and she was talking about Moss Hart, and I said, "When you met him, you knew it was him."
And she said, "I knew it was he."
So, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment.
And she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out.
Gershwin died at the age of 38.
He's buried in the same cemetery as my husband.
I don't want to talk about that now.
I do want to talk -- the absolute icing on this cemetery cake is the Barricini family mausoleum nearby.
I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate.
And I would like to run it for them.
And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise, who's also still working, and I looked at her sink, which is really amazing, and left.
And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street.
And a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.
And then I go and have some tea.
And then my Aunt Frances dies, and before she died, she tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel.
And I wonder what the point is and then I know, and I see that Hy Meyerowitz, Rick Meyerowitz's father, a dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx, won the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931.
That's actually Hy.
And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit, and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine.
And it says, "Ich habe genug," which is a Bach cantata, which I once thought meant "I've had it, I can't take it anymore, give me a break," but I was wrong.
It means "I have enough." And that is utterly true.
I happen to be alive, end of discussion. Thank you.

So the first question is, why do we need to even worry about a pandemic threat?
What is it that we're concerned about?
When I say "we," I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations.
We're concerned in the national security community, and of course in the biology community and the public health community.
While globalization has increased travel, it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere, all the time, all over the world.
And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you.
So a plague outbreak in Surat, India becomes not an obscure event, but a globalized event -- a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation.
Katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have readiness in hand, to be capable of handling things.
Indeed, an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once.
Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H5N1 flu -- some of you call it bird flu -- which first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s, but we didn't know about it until 1997.
At the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1.
But we're now up to 55 countries in the world, have had this virus emerge, in either birds, or people or both.
In the bird outbreaks we now can see that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus except the Americas.
And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment.
In domestic birds, especially chickens, it's 100 percent lethal.
It's one of the most lethal things we've seen in circulation in the world in any recent centuries.
And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens, and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers with the result that there's cover-up.
It's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds.
There has been this centralized event in a place called Lake Chenghai, China.
Two years ago the migrating birds had a multiple event where thousands died because of a mutation occurring in the virus, which made the species range broaden dramatically.
So that birds going to Siberia, to Europe, and to Africa carried the virus, which had not previously been possible.
We're now seeing outbreaks in human populations -- so far, fortunately, small events, tiny outbreaks, occasional clusters.
The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years to form two distinct families, if you will, of the H5N1 viral tree with branches in them, and with different attributes that are worrying.
So what's concerning us? Well, first of all, at no time in history have we succeeded in making in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine for more than 260 million people.
It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.
You've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling.
But nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective if we have a real outbreak.
So one thought is: after 9/11, when the airports closed, our flu season was delayed by two weeks.
So the thought is, hey, maybe what we should do is just immediately -- we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human, the virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter -- let's shut down the airports.
However, huge supercomputer analyses, done of the likely effectiveness of this, show that it won't buy us much time at all.
And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans.
For example, all masks are made in China.
How do you get them mobilized around the world if you've shut all the airports down?
How do you get the vaccines moved around the world and the drugs moved, and whatever may or not be available that would work.
So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive.
We're worried because this virus, unlike any other flu we've ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meat of the infected animals.
We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats, and now also domestic pet dogs.
And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets, we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu: seizures, central nervous system disorders, partial paralysis.
This is not your normal garden-variety flu.
It mimics what we now understand about reconstructing the 1918 flu virus, the last great pandemic, in that it also jumped directly from birds to people.
We had evolution over time, and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings: 55 percent of people who have become infected with H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed.
And we don't have a huge number of people who got infected and never developed disease.
In experimental feeding in monkeys you can see that it actually downregulates a specific immune system modulator.
The result is that what kills you is not the virus directly, but your own immune system overreacting, saying, "Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk."
The result: most of the deaths have been in people under 30 years of age, robustly healthy young adults.
We have seen human-to-human transmission in at least three clusters -- fortunately involving very intimate contact, still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk.
Alright, so I've got you nervous.
Now you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something.
And we have spent a lot of money.
Most of the spending in the Bush administration has actually been more related to the anthrax results and bio-terrorism threat.
But a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level to look at infectious diseases.
End result: only 15 states have been certified to be able to do mass distribution of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic.
Half the states would run out of hospital beds in the first week, maybe two weeks.
And 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage.
Add on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble.
So what have people been doing with this money?
Exercises, drills, all over the world.
Let's pretend there's a pandemic.
Let's everybody run around and play your role.
Main result is that there is tremendous confusion.
Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be.
And the bottom line, major thing that has come through in every single drill: nobody knows who's in charge.
Nobody knows the chain of command.
If it were Los Angeles, is it the mayor, the governor, the President of the United States, the head of Homeland Security?
In fact, the federal government says it's a guy called the Principle Federal Officer, who happens to be with TSA.
The government says the federal responsibility will basically be about trying to keep the virus out, which we all know is impossible, and then to mitigate the impact primarily on our economy.
The rest is up to your local community.
Everything is about your town, where you live.
Well how good a city council you have, how good a mayor you have -- that's who's going to be in charge.
Most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu, which may or may not be helpful -- I'll get into that -- of available vaccines, and any other treatments, and masks, and anything that's been stockpiled.
And you'll have massive competition.
Now we did purchase a vaccine, you've probably all heard about it, made by Sanofi-Aventis.
Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.
We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus.
The vaccine will probably be useless.
So here's where the decisions come in.
You're the mayor of your local town.
Let's see, should we order that all pets be kept indoors?
Germany did that when H5N1 appeared in Germany last year, in order to minimize the spread between households by household cats, dogs and so on.
What do we do when we don't have any containment rooms with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers to take care of patients?
These are in Hong Kong; we have nothing like that here.
What about quarantine?
During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help.
We have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the United States.
And some states have differential policies, county by county.
But what about the no-brainer things? Should we close all the schools?
Well then what about all the workers? They won't go to work if their kids aren't in school.
Encouraging telecommuting? What works?
Well the British government did a model of telecommuting.
Six weeks they had all people in the banking industry pretend a pandemic was underway.
What they found was, the core functions -- you know you still sort of had banks, but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines.
Nobody was processing the credit cards.
Your insurance payments didn't go through.
And basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs.
And that's just office workers, bankers.
We don't know how important hand washing is for flu -- shocking. One assumes it's a good idea to wash your hands a lot.
But actually in scientific community there is great debate about what percentage of flu transmission between people is from sneezing and coughing and what percentage is on your hands.
The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question.
Can we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masks because we don't make them in America anymore, they're all made in China -- do we need N95? A state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line, must-be-fitted-to-your-face mask?
Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks?
In the SARS epidemic, we learned in Hong Kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks improperly.
And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask, and then they rubbed their nose. Bingo! They got SARS.
It wasn't flying microbes.
If you go online right now, you'll get so much phony-baloney information.
You'll end up buying -- this is called an N95 mask. Ridiculous.
We don't actually have a standard for what should be the protective gear for the first responders, the people who will actually be there on the front lines.
And Tamiflu. You've probably heard of this drug, made by Hoffmann-La Roche, patented drug.
There is some indication that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak.
Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time, well, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.
A public health survey analyzed the effect that large-scale Tamiflu use would have, actually shows it counteractive to public health measures, making matters worse.
And here is the other interesting thing: when a human being ingests Tamiflu, only 20 percent is metabolized appropriately to be an active compound in the human being.
The rest turns into a stable compound, which survives filtration into the water systems, thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu and providing them a chance to breed resistant strains.
And we now have seen Tamiflu-resistant strains in both Vietnam in person-to-person transmission, and in Egypt in person-to-person transmission.
So I personally think that our life expectancy for Tamiflu as an effective drug is very limited -- very limited indeed.
Nevertheless most of the governments have based their whole flu policies on building stockpiles of Tamiflu.
Russia has actually stockpiled enough for 95 percent of all Russians.
We've stockpiled enough for 30 percent.
When I say enough, that's two weeks worth.
And then you're on your own because the pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months.
Some of the poorer countries that have had the most experience with H5N1 have built up stockpiles; they're already expired. They are already out of date.
What do we know from 1918, the last great pandemic?
The federal government abdicated most responsibility.
And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations all over America.
Every city, county, state did their own thing.
And the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate.
In some cases all schools, all churches, all public venues were closed.
The pandemic circulated three times in 18 months in the absence of commercial air travel.
The second wave was the mutated, super-killer wave.
And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers.
But by the time the second wave hit it took such a toll among the healthcare workers that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines.
Overall we lost 700,000 people.
The virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant women and we don't actually know why.
Most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds -- robustly healthy young adults.
It was likened to the plague.
We don't actually know how many people died.
The low-ball estimate is 35 million.
This was based on European and North American data.
A new study by Chris Murray at Harvard shows that if you look at the databases that were kept by the Brits in India, there was a 31-fold greater death rate among the Indians.
So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty the death toll was far higher.
And that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people before we had commercial air travel.
So are we ready?
As a nation, no we're not.
And I think even those in the leadership would say that is the case, that we still have a long ways to go.
So what does that mean for you? Well the first thing is, I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything -- for yourself, your family, or your employees -- unless you've really done your homework.
What mask works, what mask doesn't work.
How many masks do you need?
The Institute of Medicine study felt that you could not recycle masks.
Well if you think it's going to last 18 months, are you going to buy 18 months worth of masks for every single person in your family?
We don't know -- again with Tamiflu, the number one side effect of Tamiflu is flu-like symptoms.
So then how can you tell who in your family has the flu if everybody is taking Tamiflu?
If you expand that out to think of a whole community, or all your employees in your company, you begin to realize how limited the Tamiflu option might be.
Everybody has come up to me and said, well I'll stockpile water or, I'll stockpile food, or what have you.
But really? Do you really have a place to stockpile 18 months worth of food? Twenty-four months worth of food?
Do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue, and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu?
I don't think that's rational.
I think it's about having to be prepared as communities, not as individuals -- being prepared as nation, being prepared as state, being prepared as town.
And right now most of the preparedness is deeply flawed.
And I hope I've convinced you of that, which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders, and your national leaders, "Why haven't you solved these problems?
Why are you still thinking that the lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu?"
And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put.
But I guess the other thing to add is, if you do have employees, and you do have a company, I think you have certain responsibilities to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them, and you are trying to plan.
At a minimum the British banking plan showed that telecommuting can be helpful.
It probably does reduce exposure because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other, or touching common objects and sharing things via their hands.
But can you sustain your company that way?
Well if you have a dot-com, maybe you can.
Otherwise you're in trouble.
Happy to take your questions.
Audience member: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic?
Laurie Garret: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic, we don't really know.
I could give you a bunch of flip, this, that, and the other.
But I would say that honestly we don't know.
Clearly the bottom line is the virus eventually attenuates, and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity, and finds other hosts.
But we don't really know how and why that happens.
It's a very complicated ecology.
Audience member: What kind of triggers are you looking for?
You know way more than any of us.
To say ahh, if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic?
LG: The moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission.
Not just intimately between family members who took care of an ailing sister or brother, but a community infected -- spread within a school, spread within a dormitory, something of that nature.
Then I think that there is universal agreement now, at WHO all the way down: Send out the alert.
Audience member: Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful.
Can you talk about that?
LG: Yeah. There is some evidence that taking Lipitor and other common statins for cholesterol control may decrease your vulnerability to influenza.
But we do not completely understand why.
The mechanism isn't clear.
And I don't know that there is any way responsibly for someone to start medicating their children with their personal supply of Lipitor or something of that nature.
We have absolutely no idea what that would do.
You might be causing some very dangerous outcomes in your children, doing such a thing.
Audience member: How far along are we in being able to determine whether someone is actually carrying, whether somebody has this before the symptoms are full-blown?
LG: Right. So I have for a long time said that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic.
And our Centers for Disease Control has labeled a test they developed a rapid diagnostic.
It takes 24 hours in a very highly developed laboratory, in highly skilled hands.
I'm thinking dipstick.
You could do it to your own kid. It changes color.
It tells you if you have H5N1.
In terms of where we are in science with DNA identification capacities and so on, it's not that far off.
But we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there.
Audience member: In the 1918 flu I understand that they theorized that there was some attenuation of the virus when it made the leap into humans.
Is that likely, do you think, here?
I mean 100 percent death rate is pretty severe.
LG: Um yeah. So we don't actually know what the lethality was of the 1918 strain to wild birds before it jumped from birds to humans.
It's curious that there is no evidence of mass die-offs of chickens or household birds across America before the human pandemic happened.
That may be because those events were occurring on the other side of the world where nobody was paying attention.
But the virus clearly went through one round around the world in a mild enough form that the British army in World War I actually certified that it was not a threat and would not affect the outcome of the war.
And after circulating around the world came back in a form that was tremendously lethal.
What percentage of infected people were killed by it?
Again we don't really know for sure.
It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with, you had a weakened immune system, you lived in poverty in India or Africa, your likelihood of dying was far greater.
But we don't really know.
Audience member: One of the things I've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia, and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival.
LG: For a long time, researchers in emerging diseases were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat on the grounds that back in 1918 they didn't have antibiotics.
And that most people who die of regular flu -- which in regular flu years is about 360,000 people worldwide, most of them senior citizens -- and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system.
And along comes pneumococcus or another bacteria, streptococcus and boom, they get a bacterial pneumonia.
But it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all.
And so far in the H5N1 cases in people, similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all.
It's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system that is the key to why people die of this virus.
And I would just add we saw the same thing with SARS.
So what's going on here is your body says, your immune system sends out all its sentinels and says, "I don't know what the heck this is.
We've never seen anything even remotely like this before."
It won't do any good to bring in the sharpshooters because those antibodies aren't here.
And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those T-cells don't recognize it either.
So we're going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response, stimulate the total cytokine cascade.
The whole immune system swarms into the lungs.
And yes they die, drowning in their own fluids, of pneumonia.
But it's not bacterial pneumonia.
And it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine.
And I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention.

<title>Laurie Garrett: Lessons from the 1918 flu</title>
<description>In 2007, as the world worried about a possible avian flu epidemic, Laurie Garrett, author of "The Coming Plague," gave this powerful talk to a small University audience. Her insights from past pandemics are suddenly more relevant than ever.</description>
<keywords>business,health,health care,history,politics,technology</keywords>

Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature, their complex structure, the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty.
I used to climb trees for fun all the time and now, as a grown-up, I have made my profession understanding trees and forests, through the medium of science.
The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy.
And Dr. Terry Erwin, in 1983, called the canopy, "the last biotic frontier."
I'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy, and share with you what canopy researchers are asking and also how they're communicating with other people outside of science.
Let's start our journey on the forest floor of one of my study sites in Costa Rica.
Because of the overhanging leaves and branches, you'll notice that the understory is very dark, it's very still.
And what I'd like to do is take you up to the canopy, not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses, but rather showing you a very short clip from a National Geographic film called "Heroes of the High Frontier."
This was filmed in Monteverde, Costa Rica and I think it gives us the best impression of what it's like to climb a giant strangler fig.
So what you'll see up there is that it's really like the atmosphere of an open field, and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted to make their way and their life in the canopy.
Common groups, like the sloth here, have clear adaptations for forest canopies, hanging on with their very strong claws.
But I'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity and tell you about the ants.
There are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists -- people who describe and name animals -- have named.
4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy.
One of the reasons I tell you about ants is because of my husband, who is in fact an ant taxonomist and when we got married, he promised to name an ant after me, which he did -- Procryptocerus nalini, a canopy ant.
We've had two children, August Andrew and Erika and actually, he named ants after them.
So we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us.
But my passion -- in addition to Jack and my children -- are the plants, the so-called epiphytes, those plants that grow up on trees.
They don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor.
But rather, it is their leaves that are adapted to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog.
These plants occur in great diversity, over 28,000 species around the world.
They grow in tropical forests like this one and they also grow in temperate rainforests, that we find in Washington state.
These epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses.
One thing I want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes, as they die and decompose, they actually construct an arboreal soil, both in the temperate zone and in the tropics.
And these mosses, generated by decomposing, are like peat moss in your garden.
They have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water.
One of the surprising things I discovered is that, if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes, what you'll find underneath them are connections, networks of what we call canopy roots.
These are not epiphyte roots: these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves.
And so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor.
I was interested, and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested in the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest.
We've done stripping experiments where we've removed mats of epiphytes and looked at the rates of recolonization.
We had predicted that they would grow back very quickly and that they would come in encroaching from the side.
What we found, however, was that they took an extremely long time -- over 20 years -- to regenerate, starting from the bottom and growing up.
And even now, after 25 years, they're not up there, they have not recolonized completely.
And I use this little image to say this is what happens to mosses.
If it's gone, it's gone, and if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom.
So, recolonization is really very slow.
These canopy communities are fragile.
Well, when we look out, you and I, over that canopy of the intact primary forest, what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon.
One of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered.
We know it's a lot, but we do not yet know the answers to how much, and by what processes, carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere, held in its biomass, and moving on through the ecosystem.
So I hope I've showed you that canopy-dwellers are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy that Tarzan and Jane were interested in, but rather that they foster biodiversity contribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles, and they also help to keep our global climate stable.
Up in the canopy, if you were sitting next to me and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems, you would also see scenes like this.
Scenes of forest destruction, forest harvesting and forest fragmentation, thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has when it is not disturbed by humans.
I've also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives.
People who grew up in a place like this did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees and forests, as I did when I was a young girl.
This troubles me.
Here in 2009, you know, it's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist, gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer them.
And especially, you know, as a small brown woman in a little college, in the upper northwest part of our country, far away from the areas of power and money, I really have to ask myself, "What can I do about this?
How can I reconnect people with trees?"
Well, I think that I can do something.
I know that as a scientist, I have information and as a human being, I can communicate with anybody, inside or outside of academia.
And so, that's what I've begin doing, and so I'd like to unveil the International Canopy Network here.
We consult to the media about canopy questions; we have a canopy newsletter; we have an email LISTSERV.
And so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy, the beauty of the canopy, the necessity of intact canopies, to people outside of academia.
We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make -- those videos and so forth -- you know, they don't reach everybody, and so we've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia, and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to.
Treetop Barbie is a great example of that.
What we do, my students in my lab and I, is we buy Barbies from Goodwill and Value Village, we dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses and we send her out with a canopy handbook.
And my feeling is -- Thank you.
-- that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit to become an ambassador who can carry the message that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing.
We've also made partnerships with artists, with people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty of trees and forest canopies.
And I'd like to just tell you one of our projects, which is the generation of Canopy Confluences.
What I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds, and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms; and we look at nature, we look at trees, we look at the canopy, and we communicate, and exchange, and express what we see together.
The results have been fantastic.
I'll just give you a few examples.
This is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao who is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department at Rhode Island School of Design.
He saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences in the Pacific Northwest, and created this beautiful sculpture.
We've had dance people up in the canopy.
Jodi Lomask, and her wonderful troupe Capacitor, joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica.
They made a fabulous dance called "Biome."
They danced in the forest, and we are taking this dance, my scientific outreach communications, and also linking up with environmental groups, to go to different cities and to perform the science, the dance and the environmental outreach that we hope will make a difference.
We brought musicians to the canopy, and they made their music -- and it's fantastic music.
We had wooden flutists, we had oboists, we had opera singers, we had guitar players, and we had rap singers.
And I brought a little segment to give you of Duke Brady's "Canopy Rap."
That's Duke!
This experience of working with Duke also led me to initiate a program called Sound Science.
I saw the power of Duke's song with urban youth -- an audience, you know, I as a middle-aged professor, I don't have a hope of getting to -- in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands.
So I engaged Caution, this rap singer, with a group of young people from inner-city Tacoma.
We went out to the forest, I would pick up a branch, Caution would rap on it, and suddenly that branch was really cool.
And then the students would come into our sound studios, they would make their own rap songs with their own beats.
They ended up making a CD which they took home to their family and friends, thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium.
The final project I'll talk about is one that's very close to my heart, and it involves an economic and social value that is associated with epiphytic plants.
In the Pacific Northwest, there's a whole industry of moss-harvesting from old-growth forests.
These mosses are taken from the forest; they're used by the floriculture industry, by florists, to make arrangements and make hanging baskets.
It's a 265 million dollar industry and it's increasing rapidly.
If you remember that bald guy, you'll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks in the Pacific Northwest old-growth forest is going to take decades and decades to come back.
So this whole industry is unsustainable.
What can I, as an ecologist, do about that?
Well, my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses, and that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild.
And I thought, if I had some partners that could help me with this, that would be great.
And so, I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women -- who don't have access to nature, who often have a lot of time, they often have space, and you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses -- would be great partners.
And they have become excellent partners.
The best I can imagine.
They were very enthusiastic.
They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work.
They learned how to distinguish different species of mosses, which, to tell you the truth, is a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do.
And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses.
We've been successful as partners in figuring out which species grow the fastest, and I've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been.
Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well, I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons.
I brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison.
We gave talks once a month, and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons -- organic gardens, worm culture, recycling, water catchment and beekeeping.
Our latest endeavor, with a grant from the Department of Corrections at Washington state, they've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons.
And our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon.
So they will raise them -- in captivity, of course -- from eggs to tadpoles and onward to frogs.
And they will have the pleasure, many of them, of seeing those frogs that they've raised from eggs and helped develop, helped nurture, move out into protected wildlands to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild.
And so, I think for many reasons -- ecological, social, economic and perhaps even spiritual -- this has been a tremendous project and I'm really looking forward to not only myself and my students doing it, but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this.
As many of you are aware, the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one.
I'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community.
And so I'm hoping that my husband Jack, the ant taxonomist, can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken.
Perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together and make an opera about AIDS.
Or perhaps Al Gore and Naturally 7 could make a song about climate change that would really make you clap your hands.
So, although it's a little bit of a fantasy, I think it's also a reality.
Given the duress that we're feeling environmentally in these times, it is time for scientists to reach outward, and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well.
I started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests with the tools of science.
By making these partnerships that I described to you, I have really opened my mind and, I have to say, my heart to have a greater understanding, to make other discoveries about nature and myself.
When I look into my heart, I see trees -- this is actually an image of a real heart -- there are trees in our hearts, there are trees in your hearts.
When we come to understand nature, we are touching the most deep, the most important parts of our self.
In these partnerships, I have also learned that people tend to compartmentalize themselves into IT people, and movie star people, and scientists, but when we share nature, when we share our perspectives about nature, we find a common denominator.
Finally, as a scientist and as a person and now, as part of the TED community, I feel that I have better tools to go out to trees, to go out to forests, to go out to nature, to make new discoveries about nature -- and about humans' place in nature wherever we are and whomever you are.
Thank you very much.

Once upon a time, the world was a big, dysfunctional family.
It was run by the great and powerful parents, and the people were helpless and hopeless naughty children.
If any of the more rowdier children questioned the authority of the parents, they were scolded.
If they went exploring into the parents' rooms, or even into the secret filing cabinets, they were punished, and told that for their own good they must never go in there again.
Then one day, a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents' rooms.
"Look what they've been hiding from you," he said.
The children looked and were amazed.
There were maps and minutes from meetings where the parents were slagging each other off.
They behaved just like the children.
And they made mistakes, too, just like the children.
The only difference was, their mistakes were in the secret filing cabinets.
Well, there was a girl in the town, and she didn't think they should be in the secret filing cabinets, or if they were, there ought to be a law to allow the children access.
And so she set about to make it so.
Well, I'm the girl in that story, and the secret documents that I was interested in were located in this building, the British Parliament, and the data that I wanted to get my hands on were the expense receipts of members of Parliament.
I thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy.
It wasn't like I was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker, or anything like that, but the amount of resistance I got from this Freedom of Information request, you would have thought I'd asked something like this.
So I fought for about five years doing this, and it was one of many hundreds of requests that I made, to revolutionize the British Parliament.
That was not my intention. I was just making these requests as part of research for my first book.
But it ended up in this very long, protracted legal battle and there I was after five years fighting against Parliament in front of three of Britain's most eminent High Court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data.
And I've got to tell you, I wasn't that hopeful, because I'd seen the establishment. I thought, it always sticks together. I am out of luck.
Well, guess what? I won. Hooray.
Well, that's not exactly the story, because the problem was that Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data, and then they tried to retrospectively change the law so that it would no longer apply to them.
The transparency law they'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else, they tried to keep it so it didn't apply to them.
What they hadn't counted on was digitization, because that meant that all those paper receipts had been scanned in electronically, and it was very easy for somebody to just copy that entire database, put it on a disk, and then just saunter outside of Parliament, which they did, and then they shopped that disk to the highest bidder, which was the Daily Telegraph, and then, you all remember, there was weeks and weeks of revelations, everything from porn movies and bath plugs and new kitchens and mortgages that had never been paid off.
The end result was six ministers resigned, the first speaker of the house in 300 years was forced to resign, a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency, 120 MPs stepped down at that election, and so far, four MPs and two lords have done jail time for fraud.
So, thank you.
Well, I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain.
It was an example of a culture clash that's happening all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged officials who think that they can rule over us without very much prying from the public, and then suddenly confronted with a public who is no longer content with that arrangement, and not only not content with it, now, more often, armed with official data itself.
So we are moving to this democratization of information, and I've been in this field for quite a while.
I used to have these little spy books, and I would, like, see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down.
I think that was a pretty good indication about my future career as an investigative journalist, and what I've seen from being in this access to information field for so long is that it used to be quite a niche interest, and it's gone mainstream. Everybody, increasingly, around the world, wants to know about what people in power are doing.
They want a say in decisions that are made in their name and with their money. It's this democratization of information that I think is an information enlightenment, and it has many of the same principles of the first Enlightenment.
It's about searching for the truth, not because somebody says it's true, "because I say so."
No, it's about trying to find the truth based on what you can see and what can be tested.
That, in the first Enlightenment, led to questions about the right of kings, the divine right of kings to rule over people, or that women should be subordinate to men, or that the Church was the official word of God.
Obviously the Church weren't very happy about this, and they tried to suppress it, but what they hadn't counted on was technology, and then they had the printing press, which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply, far and fast, and people would come together in coffee houses, discuss the ideas, plot revolution.
In our day, we have digitization. That strips all the physical mass out of information, so now it's almost zero cost to copy and share information.
Our printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks.
We're moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system, and we have global decisions to make in this system, decisions about climate, about finance systems, about resources. And think about it -- if we want to make an important decision about buying a house, we don't just go off. I mean, I don't know about you, but I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it.
And if we're thinking about a finance system, we need a lot of information to take in. It's just not possible for one person to take in the amount, the volume of information, and analyze it to make good decisions.
So that's why we're seeing increasingly this demand for access to information.
That's why we're starting to see more disclosure laws come out, so for example, on the environment, there's the Aarhus Convention, which is a European directive that gives people a very strong right to know, so if your water company is dumping water into your river, sewage water into your river, you have a right to know about it.
In the finance industry, you now have more of a right to know about what's going on, so we have different anti-bribery laws, money regulations, increased corporate disclosure, so you can now track assets across borders.
And it's getting harder to hide assets, tax avoidance, pay inequality. So that's great. We're starting to find out more and more about these systems.
And they're all moving to this central system, this fully connected system, all of them except one. Can you guess which one?
It's the system which underpins all these other systems.
It's the system by which we organize and exercise power, and there I'm talking about politics, because in politics, we're back to this system, this top-down hierarchy.
And how is it possible that the volume of information Well, it just can't. That's it.
And I think this is largely what's behind the crisis of legitimacy in our different governments right now.
So I've told you a bit about what I did to try and drag Parliament, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century, and I'm just going to give you a couple of examples of what a few other people I know are doing.
So this is a guy called Seb Bacon. He's a computer programmer, and he built a site called Alaveteli, and what it is, it's a Freedom of Information platform.
It's open-source, with documentation, and it allows you to make a Freedom of Information request, to ask your public body a question, so it takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you that there is a lot of hassle making these requests, so it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question, for example, how many police officers have a criminal record?
It zooms it off to the appropriate person, it tells you when the time limit is coming to an end, it keeps track of all the correspondence, it posts it up there, and it becomes an archive of public knowledge.
So that's open-source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of Freedom of Information law.
So there's a list there of the different countries that have it, and then there's a few more coming on board.
So if any of you out there like the sound of that and have a law like that in your country, I know that Seb would love to hear from you about collaborating and getting that into your country.
This is Birgitta Jónsdóttir. She's an Icelandic MP.
And quite an unusual MP. In Iceland, she was one of the protesters who was outside of Parliament when the country's economy collapsed, and then she was elected on a reform mandate, and she's now spearheading this project.
It's the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative, and they've just got funding to make it an international modern media project, and this is taking all of the best laws around the world about freedom of expression, protection of whistleblowers, protection from libel, source protection, and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven.
It's a place where your data can be free, so when we think about, increasingly, how governments want to access user data, what they're trying to do in Iceland is make this safe haven where it can happen.
In my own field of investigative journalism, we're also having to start thinking globally, so this is a site called Investigative Dashboard. And if you're trying to track a dictator's assets, for example, Hosni Mubarak, you know, he's just funneling out cash from his country when he knows he's in trouble, and what you want to do to investigate that is, you need to have access to all of the world's, as many as you can, companies' house registrations databases.
So this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those databases into one place so you can start searching for, you know, his relatives, his friends, the head of his security services.
You can try and find out how he's moving out assets from that country.
But again, when it comes to the decisions which are impacting us the most, perhaps, the most important decisions that are being made about war and so forth, again we can't just make a Freedom of Information request.
It's really difficult. So we're still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information, through leaks.
So when the Guardian did this investigation about the Afghan War, you know, they can't walk into the Department of Defense and ask for all the information.
You know, they're just not going to get it.
So this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches that were written by American soldiers about the Afghan War, and leaked, and then they're able to do this investigation.
Another rather large investigation is around world diplomacy.
Again, this is all based around leaks, 251,000 U.S. diplomatic cables, and I was involved in this investigation because I got this leak through a leak from a disgruntled WikiLeaker and ended up going to work at the Guardian.
So I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak. It was amazing. I mean, it was amazing.
It reminded me of that scene in "The Wizard of Oz."
Do you know the one I mean? Where the little dog Toto runs across to where the wizard [is], and he pulls back, the dog's pulling back the curtain, and -- "Don't look behind the screen. Don't look at the man behind the screen."
It was just like that, because what you started to see is that all of these grand statesmen, these very pompous politicians, they were just like us.
They all bitched about each other. I mean, quite gossipy, those cables. Okay, but I thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp, these are human beings just like us. They don't have special powers.
They're not magic. They are not our parents.
Beyond that, what I found most fascinating was the level of endemic corruption that I saw across all different countries, and particularly centered around the heart of power, around public officials who were embezzling the public's money for their own personal enrichment, and allowed to do that because of official secrecy.
So I've mentioned WikiLeaks, because surely what could be more open than publishing all the material?
Because that is what Julian Assange did.
He wasn't content with the way the newspapers published it to be safe and legal. He threw it all out there.
That did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan being exposed. It also meant that the Belarussian dictator was given a handy list of all the pro-democracy campaigners in that country who had spoken to the U.S. government.
Is that radical openness? I say it's not, because for me, what it means, it doesn't mean abdicating power, responsibility, accountability, it's actually being a partner with power. It's about sharing responsibility, sharing accountability. Also, the fact that he threatened to sue me because I got a leak of his leaks, I thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology, to be honest, as well.
The other thing is that power is incredibly seductive, and you must have two real qualities, I think, when you come to the table, when you're dealing with power, talking about power, because of its seductive capacity.
You've got to have skepticism and humility.
Skepticism, because you must always be challenging.
I want to see why do you -- you just say so? That's not good enough.
I want to see the evidence behind why that's so.
And humility because we are all human. We all make mistakes.
And if you don't have skepticism and humility, then it's a really short journey to go from reformer to autocrat, and I think you only have to read "Animal Farm" to get that message about how power corrupts people.
So what is the solution? It is, I believe, to embody within the rule of law rights to information.
At the moment our rights are incredibly weak.
In a lot of countries, we have Official Secrets Acts, including in Britain here. We have an Official Secrets Act with no public interest test. So that means it's a crime, people are punished, quite severely in a lot of cases, for publishing or giving away official information.
Now wouldn't it be amazing, and really, this is what I want all of you to think about, if we had an Official Disclosure Act where officials were punished if they were found to have suppressed or hidden information that was in the public interest?
So that -- yes. Yes! My power pose.
I would like us to work towards that.
So it's not all bad news. I mean, there definitely is progress on the line, but I think what we find is that the closer that we get right into the heart of power, the more opaque, closed it becomes.
So it was only just the other week that I heard London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner talking about why the police need access to all of our communications, spying on us without any judicial oversight, and he said it was a matter of life and death.
He actually said that, it was a matter of life and death.
There was no evidence. He presented no evidence of that.
It was just, "Because I say so.
You have to trust me. Take it on faith."
Well, I'm sorry, people, but we are back to the pre-Enlightenment Church, and we need to fight against that.
So he was talking about the law in Britain which is the Communications Data Bill, an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation.
In America, you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.
You've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance.
You have the National Security Agency building the world's giantest spy center. It's just this colossal -- it's five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol, in which they're going to intercept and analyze communications, traffic and personal data to try and figure out who's the troublemaker in society.
Well, to go back to our original story, the parents have panicked. They've locked all the doors.
They've kidded out the house with CCTV cameras.
They're watching all of us. They've dug a basement, and they've built a spy center to try and run algorithms and figure out which ones of us are troublesome, and if any of us complain about that, we're arrested for terrorism.
Well, is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare?
Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't.
I think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales, which are, indeed, very grim.
But the world isn't a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge.
Equally, it could be better than we've been led to believe, but either way, we have to start seeing it exactly as it is, with all of its problems, because it's only by seeing it with all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them and live in a world in which we can all be happily ever after. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

When I was 10 years old, a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.
And as a special treat, he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands.
And there it was, the seat of human consciousness, the powerhouse of the human body, sitting in my hands.
And that day I knew that when I grew up, I was going to become a brain doctor, scientist, something or the other.
Years later, when I finally grew up, my dream came true.
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I'd like to share with you all today.
It is estimated that one in six children, that's one in six children, suffer from some developmental disorder.
This is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments.
Which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder.
But here's what really perplexed me.
Despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain, most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior.
But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms, without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart.
It seemed so intuitive to me.
To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately, it would be necessary to look at the brain directly.
Looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete, or even a misleading, picture of the child's problems.
Yet, despite all the advances in medical technology, the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited.
And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it, instead of in brain research, towards diagnosing brain disorders in children.
Their groundbreaking technology records the EEG, or the electrical activity of the brain, in real time, allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions: vision, attention, language, audition.
A program called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain.
And another program called Statistical Probability Mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant, allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms.
And so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team, and we're finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders.
And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in India.
I'd like to tell you about one such child, whose story was also covered by ABC News.
Seven-year-old Justin Senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism.
Like many autistic children, his mind was locked inside his body.
There were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time.
And the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially, and he would probably never have too much language.
When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin's brain, the results were startling.
It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic.
He was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye, but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism.
After Justin was given anti-seizure medication, the change in him was amazing.
Within a period of 60 days, his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words.
And his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ.
Research shows that 50 percent of children, almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures.
These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin.
All these children came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism, attention deficit disorder, mental retardation, language problems.
Instead, our EEG scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments.
So these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment.
For too long now, children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen.
And for too long, these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation.
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience, one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively, and find the true source of so many disabilities in children.
So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder, then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved.
One more mind will be unlocked.
And one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there's still time for his or her brain to recover.
And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves.
Thank you.

So, my question: are we alone?
The story of humans is the story of ideas -- scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners, ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally, ideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed, ideas that have vanished in history, and ideas that have been set in dogma.
It's a story of nations, of ideologies, of territories, and of conflicts among them.
But, every moment of human history, from the Stone Age to the Information Age, from Sumer and Babylon to the iPod and celebrity gossip, they've all been carried out -- every book that you've read, every poem, every laugh, every tear -- they've all happened here.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Perspective is a very powerful thing.
Perspectives can change.
Perspectives can be altered.
From my perspective, we live on a fragile island of life, in a universe of possibilities.
For many millennia, humans have been on a journey to find answers, answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence, about who we are and why we are, and of course, who else might be out there.
Is it really just us?
Are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics?
Well, if we are, it's an awful waste of space.
But, what if we're not?
What if, out there, others are asking and answering similar questions?
What if they look up at the night sky, at the same stars, but from the opposite side?
Would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there inspire us to find ways to survive our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence?
Might it be the discovery of a distant civilization and our common cosmic origins that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans?
Whether we're born in San Francisco, or Sudan, or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy, we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust.
We, all of us, are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from.
Fifty years ago, the journey to find answers took a different path and SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, began.
So, what exactly is SETI?
Well, SETI uses the tools of astronomy to try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there.
Our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances, and theirs might be as well.
It might be that some massive network of communications, or some shield against asteroidal impact, or some huge astro-engineering project that we can't even begin to conceive of, could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies that a determined program of searching might detect.
For millennia, we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there.
Now, we can use the tools of the 21st century to try and observe what is, rather than ask what should be, believed.
SETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence; it merely notes the possibility, if not the probability in this vast universe, which seems fairly uniform.
The numbers suggest a universe of possibilities.
Our sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy, and we know that many other stars have planetary systems.
We've discovered over 350 in the last 14 years, including the small planet, announced earlier this week, which has a radius just twice the size of the Earth.
And, if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life, there are still 100 billion other galaxies out there, altogether 10^22 stars.
Now, I'm going to try a trick, and recreate an experiment from this morning.
Remember, one billion?
But, this time not one billion dollars, one billion stars.
Alright, one billion stars.
Now, up there, 20 feet above the stage, that's 10 trillion.
Well, what about 10^22?
Where's the line that marks that?
That line would have to be 3.8 million miles above this stage.
16 times farther away than the moon, or four percent of the distance to the sun.
So, there are many possibilities.
And much of this vast universe, much more may be habitable than we once thought, as we study extremophiles on Earth -- organisms that can live in conditions totally inhospitable for us, in the hot, high pressure thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean, frozen in ice, in boiling battery acid, in the cooling waters of nuclear reactors.
These extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments.
But those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe.
Even our nearest star, the Sun -- its emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed.
It takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us.
And the nearest star is 4.2 light years away, which means its light takes 4.2 years to get here.
And the edge of our galaxy is 75,000 light years away, and the nearest galaxy to us, 2.5 million light years.
That means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago.
And a signal would give us a glimpse of their past, not their present.
Which is why Phil Morrison calls SETI, "the archaeology of the future."
It tells us about their past, but detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future.
I think this is what David Deutsch meant in 2005, when he ended his Oxford TEDTalk by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living, and he would like to carve them on stone tablets.
The first is that problems are inevitable.
The second is that problems are soluble.
So, ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of SETI is the longevity of technologies, and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos -- distance over space and distance over time.
If technologies don't last and persist, we will not succeed.
And we're a very young technology in an old galaxy, and we don't yet know whether it's possible for technologies to persist.
So, up until now I've been talking to you about really large numbers.
Let me talk about a relatively small number.
And that's the length of time that the Earth was lifeless.
Zircons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia, zircons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet there was abundant water and perhaps even life.
So, our planet has spent the vast majority of its 4.56 billion year history developing life, not anticipating its emergence.
Life happened very quickly, and that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos.
And the other thing that one should take away from this chart is the very narrow range of time over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet.
It's only the last few hundred thousand years modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization.
So, one needs a very deep appreciation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos.
We are not the pinnacle of evolution.
We are not the determined product of billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning.
We are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process.
We are residents of one small planet in a corner of the Milky Way galaxy.
And Homo sapiens are one small leaf on a very extensive Tree of Life, which is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for survival over millions of years.
We misuse language, and talk about the "ascent" of man.
We understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life but our ego hasn't caught up yet.
So this "ascent" of man, pinnacle of evolution, has got to go.
It's a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn't share.
Loren Eiseley has said, "One does not meet oneself until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human."
One day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien, and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution the sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations.
We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution, and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story, and perhaps SETI will help as well.
Occasionally, throughout history, this concept of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface, and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries.
So in 1543, Nicholas Copernicus published "The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres," and by taking the Earth out of the center, and putting the sun in the center of the solar system, he opened our eyes to a much larger universe, of which we are just a small part.
And that Copernican revolution continues today to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology.
So, in 1959, Giuseppe Coccone and Philip Morrison published the first SETI article in a refereed journal, and brought SETI into the scientific mainstream.
And in 1960, Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation looking at two stars, Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, for about 150 hours.
Now Drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence, but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft, and that's that terrestrial technology can interfere with the search for extraterrestrial technology.
We've been searching ever since, but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains.
All of the concerted SETI efforts, over the last 40-some years, are equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans.
And no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water.
The 21st century now allows us to build bigger glasses -- much bigger glasses.
In Northern California, we're beginning to take observations with the first 42 telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array -- and I've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold and all the TeamSETI members in the TED community who have so generously supported this research.
The ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes, and hooked together with computers.
It's making silicon as important as aluminum, and we'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350 for more sensitivity and leveraging Moore's law for more processing capability.
Today, our signal detection algorithms can find very simple artifacts and noise.
If you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, the most distant human object in the universe, 106 times as far away from us as the sun is.
And over those long distances, its signal is very faint when it reaches us.
It may be hard for your eye to see it, but it's easily found with our efficient algorithms.
But this is a simple signal, and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals.
This is a very good year.
2009 is the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope, Darwin's 200th birthday, the 150th anniversary of the publication of "On the Origin of Species," the 50th anniversary of SETI as a science, the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non-profit, and of course, the 25th anniversary of TED.
And next month, the Kepler Spacecraft will launch and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth-like planets are, the targets for SETI's searches.
In 2009, the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy, a global festival to help us residents of Earth rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe.
And in 2009, change has come to Washington, with a promise to put science in its rightful position.
So, what would change everything?
Well, this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year, and four of the respondents said, "SETI."
Why?
Well, to quote: "The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that has plagued our species since its inception.
And it wouldn't simply change everything, it would change everything all at once."
So, if that's right, why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds?
I think it's a problem of completion and delivery, because the fine print said, "What game-changing ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see?"
So, we have a fulfillment problem.
We need bigger glasses and more hands in the water, and then working together, maybe we can all live to see the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal.
That brings me to my wish.
I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company.
The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust, to build an environment where raw data could be stored, and where it could be accessed and manipulated, where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient.
And this is a technically creative challenge, and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it.
And then, we'd like to augment the automated search with human insight.
We'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye to find faint, complex signals that our current algorithms miss.
And, of course, we'd like to inspire and engage the next generation.
We'd like to take the materials that we have built for education, and get them out to students everywhere, students that can't come and visit us at the ATA.
We'd like to tell our story better, and engage young people, and thereby change their perspective.
I'm sorry Seth Godin, but over the millennia, we've seen where tribalism leads.
We've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands.
And, ultimately, we actually all belong to only one tribe, to Earthlings.
And SETI is a mirror -- a mirror that can show us ourselves from an extraordinary perspective, and can help to trivialize the differences among us.
If SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet, then it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history.
So, in the opening days of 2009, a visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and said, "We cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass, that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve, that, as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself."
So, I look forward to working with the TED community to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish, and in collaborating with you, hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality.
Thank you.

Back in 1992, I started working for a company called Interval Research, which was just then being founded by David Lidell and Paul Allen as a for-profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley.
I met with David to talk about what I might do in his company.
I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books -- after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell.
And David and I discovered that we had a question in common, that we really wanted the answer to, and that was, "Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls?"
Why is that?
It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy.
These people aren't that smart.
There's six billion dollars on the table.
They would go for it if they could figure out how.
So, what is the deal here?
And as we thought about our goals -- I should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution, in the classical sense that humanism, at its best, finds a way to combine clear-eyed empirical research with a set of core values that fundamentally love and respect people.
The basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life; that we can do good things, that there are things worth doing because they're good things to do, and that clear-eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them.
So, contrary to popular belief, there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values.
And Interval Research is kind of the living example of how that can be true.
So David and I decided to go find out, through the best research we could muster, what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer, to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games.
We spent two and a half years conducting research; we spent another year and a half in advance development.
Then we formed a spin-off company.
In the research phase of the project at Interval, we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research, and these people -- Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland -- changed my mind entirely about what market research was and what it could be.
They taught me how to look and see, and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child, "Of all these things we already make you, which do you like best?" -- which gives you zero answers that are usable.
So, what we did for the first two and a half years was four things: We did an extensive review of the literature in related fields, like cognitive psychology, spatial cognition, gender studies, play theory, sociology, primatology.
Thank you Frans de Waal, wherever you are, I love you and I'd give anything to meet you.
After we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing -- because, after all, that's really what this is about -- we moved to the second phase of our work, where we interviewed adult experts in academia, some of the people who'd produced the literature that we found relevant.
Also, we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day, like playground supervisors. We talked to them, confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions about gender difference and play.
Then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work: interviewed 1,100 children, boys and girls, ages seven to 12, all over the United States -- except for Silicon Valley, Boston and Austin because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them and they wouldn't be a representative sample.
And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the United States, after two years, we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children, drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research, and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics, for designing computer-based products -- and, in fact, any kind of products -- for little girls, ages eight to 12.
And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software and testing them with little girls.
In 1996, in November, we formed the company Purple Moon which was a spinoff of Interval Research, and our chief investors were Interval Research, Vulcan Northwest, Institutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company.
We launched a website on September 2nd that has now served 25 million pages, and has 42,000 registered young girl users.
They visit an average of one and a half times a day, spend an average of 35 minutes a visit, and look at 50 pages a visit.
So we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls.
We launched two titles in October -- "Rockett's New School" -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate, which allows girls to play with the question of, "What will I be like when I'm older?"
"What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school?
Who are my friends?"; to exercise the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior; and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves.
The other title that we launched is called "Secret Paths in the Forest," which addresses the more fantasy-oriented, inner lives of girls.
These two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in PC Data -- entertainment titles in PC Data in December, right up there with "John Madden Football," which thrills me to death.
So, we're real, and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls.
We've made half-a-billion impressions with marketing and PR for this brand, Purple Moon.
Ninety-six percent of them, roughly, have been positive; four percent of them have been "other."
I want to talk about the other, because the politics of this enterprise, in a way, have been the most fascinating part of it, for me.
There are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received.
One kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be, and won't show the product to little girls.
The other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be.
And so it's funny to me that these interesting, odd bedfellows have one thing in common: they don't listen to little girls.
They haven't looked at children and they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them.
I'd like to play you some voices of little girls from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did -- actually, some of the voices are more recent.
And these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives, of the things that they value and care about.
These are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to us This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to and this is the kind of research I recommend to those who want to do humanistic work.
Girl 1: Yeah, my character is usually a tomboy.
Hers is more into boys.
Girl 2: Uh, yeah.
Girl 1: We have -- in the very beginning of the whole game, always we do this: we each have a piece of paper; we write down our name, our age -- are we rich, very rich, not rich, poor, medium, wealthy, boyfriends, dogs, pets -- what else -- sisters, brothers, and all those.
Girl 2: Divorced -- parents divorced, maybe.
Girl 3: This is my pretend [unclear] one.
Girl 4: We make a school newspaper on the computer.
Girl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery with clouds and flowers.
Girl 6: Like, if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy, you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy.
Girl 7: I run track, I played soccer, I play basketball, and I love a lot of things to do.
And sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation, like when I get Mondays and all those days off.
Girl 8: Well, sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on because I have music lessons and I'm on swim team -- all this different stuff that I have to do, and sometimes it gets overwhelming.
Girl 9: My friend Justine kinda took my friend Kelly, and now they're being mean to me.
Girl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters, or brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves.
Girl 11: Because my older sister, she gets everything and, like, when I ask my mom for something, she'll say, "No" -- all the time.
But she gives my sister everything.
Brenda Laurel: I want to show you, real quickly, just a minute of "Rockett's Tricky Decision," which went gold two days ago.
Let's hope it's really stable.
This is the second day in Rockett's life.
The reason I'm showing you this is I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar, now that you've listened to some girls' voices.
And you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them in the game that we've created.
Miko: Hey Rockett! C'mere!
Rockett: Hi Miko! What's going on?
Miko: Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend?
She asked me to make sure you knew about it.
Nakilia invited Reuben too, but -- Rockett: But what? Isn't he coming?
Miko: I don't think so.
I mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night.
Rockett: Really? What other party?
Girl: Max's party is going to be so cool, Whitney.
He's invited all the best people.
BL: I'm going to fast-forward to the decision point because I know I don't have a lot of time.
After this awful event occurs, Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it.
Rockett: Who'd want to show up at that party anyway?
I could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to.
Gee, I doubt I'll make Max's best people list.
BL: OK, so we're going to emotionally navigate.
If we were playing the game, that's what we'd do.
If at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters, we can go into this hidden hallway, and I'll quickly just show you the interface.
We can, for example, go find Miko's locker and get some more information about her.
Oops, I turned the wrong way.
But you get the general idea of the product.
I wanted to show you the ways, innocuous as they seem, in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls -- their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility, and to play around with the social complexity of their lives.
I want to make the point that what we're giving girls, I think, through this effort, is a kind of validation, a sense of being seen.
And a sense of the choices that are available in their lives.
We love them.
We see them.
We're not trying to tell them who they ought to be.
But we're really, really happy about who they are.
It turns out they're really great.
I want to close by showing you a videotape that's a version of a future game in the Rockett series that our graphic artists and design people put together, that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers.
"Rockett 28!"
Rockett: It's like I'm just waking up, you know?
BL: Thanks.

I love theater.
I love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective.
I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen.
The idea that in that room at that moment, everyone, regardless of their age, their gender, their race, their color, their religion, comes together.
At that moment, we transcend space and time together.
Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.
And our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers.
Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique.
I was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show, and began developing "Upwake."
"Upwake" tells the story of Zero, a modern-day business man, going to work with his life in a suitcase, stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two.
I wanted "Upwake" to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would.
And I wanted to let my imagination run wild.
So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head.
If Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of "The Little Prince," were here, he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside.
Because, if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear.
This is not a box; these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life.
In "Upwake" buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard, clones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice, sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space.
I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist.
Go from one world to another in a second.
I wanted to have humor, beauty, simplicity and complexity and use metaphors to suggest ideas.
At the beginning of the show, for example, Zero deejays dream and reality.
Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition, live, on stage.
So today, I would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology.
Let's start with technology.
All right. Let's start with theater.
Thank you.
"Upwake" lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds.
I project 3D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage which I interact with.
The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery.
I didn't use it as a special effect, but as a partner on stage.
There are no special effects in "Upwake," no artifice.
It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal.
Three hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later, what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists.
And here are some excerpts.
Thank you.
So this is, relatively, a new show that we're now beginning to tour.
And in Austin, Texas, I was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon.
When I arrived at one of the schools, I certainly did not expect this: Six hundred kids, packed in a gymnasium, waiting.
I was a little nervous performing without animation, costume -- really -- and make-up.
But the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive.
And I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another.
Something happened along the way.
Zero became a person and not just a character in a play.
Zero does not speak, is neither man nor woman.
Zero is Zero, a little hero of the 21st Century, and Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could.
It's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box.
As a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect.
And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance, then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud.
It's as though you made something resonate within them.
It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more.
Because through your mask, they let theirs go.
Being human is an art form.
I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives, and I know theater can heal.
I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years.
I have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy.
I know theater unites us.
Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow, tell various stories through different mediums.
Comic books. Quantum physics video games.
And Zero wants to go to the moon.
In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign, suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.
The idea is simple, basic. It's not original, but it's important, and it's important to participate.
There is a revolution.
It's a human and technological revolution.
It's motion and emotion.
It's information.
It's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial.
It's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers.
It's happening.
The natural progression of science and art finding each other to better touch and define the human experience.
There is a revolution in the way that we think, in the way that we share, and the way that we express our stories, our evolution.
This is a time of communication, connection and creative collaboration.
Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry.
He was social, and his character, The Tramp, spoke to millions.
He gave entertainment, pleasure and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most.
We are not here to question the possible; we are here to challenge the impossible.
In the science of today, we become artists.
In the art of today, we become scientists.
We design our world. We invent possibilities.
We teach, touch and move.
It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent, meaningful and extraordinary work. It's now.
Thank you.

Hello. I would like to start my talk with actually two questions, and the first one is: How many people here actually eat pig meat?
Please raise your hand -- oh, that's a lot.
And how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat?
In the last year?
In the Netherlands -- where I come from -- you actually never see a pig, which is really strange, because, on a population of 16 million people, we have 12 million pigs.
And well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs.
They eat about one-third, and the rest is exported to all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world.
A lot goes to the U.K., Germany.
And what I was curious about -- because historically, the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted -- and I was curious to find out if this was actually still the case.
And I spent about three years researching.
And I followed this one pig with number "05049," all the way up until the end and to what products it's made of.
And in these years, I met all kinds people like, for instance, farmers and butchers, which seems logical.
But I also met aluminum mold makers, ammunition producers and all kinds of people.
And what was striking to me is that the farmers actually had no clue what was made of their pigs, but the consumers -- as in us -- had also no idea of the pigs being in all these products.
So what I did is, I took all this research and I made it into a -- well, basically it's a product catalog of this one pig, and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back.
And it consists of seven chapters -- the chapters are skin, bones, meat, internal organs, blood, fat and miscellaneous.
In total, they weigh 103.7 kilograms.
And to show you how often you actually meet part of this pig in a regular day, I want to show you some images of the book.
You probably start the day with a shower.
So, in soap, fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent, but also for giving it a pearl-like effect.
Then if you look around you in the bathroom, you see lots more products like shampoo, conditioner, anti-wrinkle cream, body lotion, but also toothpaste.
Then, so, before breakfast, you've already met the pig so many times.
Then, at breakfast, the pig that I followed, the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig were used as an improver of dough.
Well, that's what the producer says: it's "improving the dough, of course."
In low-fat butter, or actually in many low-fat products, when you take the fat out, you actually take the taste and the texture out.
So what they do is they put gelatin back in, in order to retain the texture.
Well, when you're off to work, under the road or under the buildings that you see, there might very well be cellular concrete, which is a very light kind of concrete that's actually got proteins from bones inside and it's also fully reusable.
In the train brakes -- at least in the German train brakes -- there's this part of the brake that's made of bone ash.
And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts, like chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding, everything that's cooled in the supermarket, there's gelatin to make it look good.
Fine bone china -- this is a real classic.
Of course, the bone in fine-bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength, in order to make these really fine shapes, like this deer.
In interior decorating, the pig's actually quite there.
It's used in paint for the texture, but also for the glossiness.
In sandpaper, bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper.
And then in paintbrushes, hairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard-wearing nature.
I was not planning on showing you any meat because, of course, half the book's meat and you probably all know what meats they are.
But I didn't want you to miss out on this one, because this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts."
And this is actually sold in the frozen area of the supermarket.
And what it is -- it's actually steak.
So, this is sold as cow, but what happens when you slaughter a cow -- at least in industrial factory farming -- they have all these little bits of steak left that they can't actually sell as steak, so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage, then freeze the sausage, cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again.
And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops.
So, with the steak, you might drink a beer.
In the brewing process, there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer, so to get rid of these cloudy elements, what some companies do is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of that cloudiness.
This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice.
There's actually a company in Greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter.
And according to them, this creates an artificial lung in the filter.
So, this is actually a healthier cigarette.
Injectable collagen -- or, since the '70s, collagen from pigs -- has been used for injecting into wrinkles.
And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings, so the collagen is as well.
Well, this must be the strangest thing I found.
This is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the United States.
And while I was making the book, I contacted all the producers of products because I wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens.
So I sent this company an email saying, "Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research.
And can you send me a bullet?"
And well, I didn't expect them to even answer my email.
But they answered and they said, "Why, thank you for your email. What an interesting story.
Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government?"
I thought that was really weird, as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone.
So, the most beautiful thing I found -- at least what I think is the most beautiful -- in the book, is this heart valve.
It's actually a very low-tech and very high-tech product at the same time.
The low-tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve mounted in the high-tech bit, which is a memory metal casing.
And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery.
And once it's in the right spot, they remove the outer shell, and the heart valve, well, it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating, instantly.
It's really a sort of magical moment.
So this is actually a Dutch company, so I called them up, and I asked, "Can I borrow a heart valve from you?"
And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic.
So they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin, and you can borrow it."
Great -- and then I didn't hear from them for weeks, so I called, and I asked, "What's going on with the heart valve?"
And they said, "Well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve, because want his product to be associated with pigs."
Well, the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy -- actually, to show that my first question, if pigs are still used up until the last bit, was still true.
Well it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source.
In total, I found 185 products.
And what they showed me is that, well, firstly, it's at least to say odd that we don't treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens.
And the second, is that we actually don't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of.
And you might think I'm very fond of pigs, but actually -- well, I am a little bit -- but I'm more fond of raw materials in general.
And I think that, in order to take better care of what's behind our products -- so, the livestock, the crops, the plants, the non-renewable materials, but also the people that produce these products -- the first step would actually be to know that they are there.
Thank you very much.

I have spent my entire life either at the schoolhouse, on the way to the schoolhouse, or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse.
Both my parents were educators, my maternal grandparents were educators, and for the past 40 years I've done the same thing.
And so, needless to say, over those years I've had a chance to look at education reform from a lot of perspectives.
Some of those reforms have been good.
Some of them have been not so good.
And we know why kids drop out.
We know why kids don't learn.
It's either poverty, low attendance, negative peer influences. We know why.
But one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection, relationships.
James Comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship.
George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships.
Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult.
For years, I have watched people teach.
I have looked at the best and I've look at some of the worst.
A colleague said to me one time, "They don't pay me to like the kids.
They pay me to teach a lesson.
The kids should learn it.
I should teach it. They should learn it. Case closed."
Well, I said to her, "You know, kids don't learn from people they don't like."
She said, "That's just a bunch of hooey."
And I said to her, "Well, your year is going to be long and arduous, dear."
Needless to say it was. Some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship or you don't.
I think Stephen Covey had the right idea.
He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things, like seeking first to understand as opposed to being understood, simple things like apologizing.
You ever thought about that?
Tell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock.
I taught a lesson once on ratios.
I'm not real good with math, but I was working on it.
And I got back and looked at that teacher edition.
I'd taught the whole lesson wrong.
So I came back to class the next day, and I said, "Look, guys, I need to apologize.
I taught the whole lesson wrong. I'm so sorry."
They said, "That's okay, Ms. Pierson.
You were so excited, we just let you go."
I have had classes that were so low, so academically deficient that I cried.
I wondered, how am I going to take this group in nine months from where they are to where they need to be?
And it was difficult. It was awfully hard.
How do I raise the self-esteem of a child and his academic achievement at the same time?
One year I came up with a bright idea.
I told all my students, "You were chosen to be in my class because I am the best teacher and you are the best students, they put us all together so we could show everybody else how to do it."
One of the students said, "Really?"
I said, "Really. We have to show the other classes how to do it, so when we walk down the hall, people will notice us, so you can't make noise.
You just have to strut."
And I gave them a saying to say: "I am somebody.
I was somebody when I came.
I'll be a better somebody when I leave.
I am powerful, and I am strong.
I deserve the education that I get here.
I have things to do, people to impress, and places to go."
And they said, "Yeah!"
You say it long enough, it starts to be a part of you.
And so — I gave a quiz, 20 questions.
A student missed 18.
I put a "+2" on his paper and a big smiley face.
He said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?"
I said, "Yes."
He said, "Then why'd you put a smiley face?"
I said, "Because you're on a roll.
You got two right. You didn't miss them all."
I said, "And when we review this, won't you do better?"
He said, "Yes, ma'am, I can do better."
You see, "-18" sucks all the life out of you.
"+2" said, "I ain't all bad."
For years I watched my mother take the time at recess to review, go on home visits in the afternoon, buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat, and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn't smell so good.
See, it's hard to teach kids who stink.
And kids can be cruel.
And so she kept those things in her desk, and years later, after she retired, I watched some of those same kids come through and say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker, you made a difference in my life.
You made it work for me.
You made me feel like I was somebody, when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't.
And I want you to just see what I've become."
And when my mama died two years ago at 92, there were so many former students at her funeral, it brought tears to my eyes, not because she was gone, but because she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear.
Can we stand to have more relationships? Absolutely.
Will you like all your children? Of course not.
And you know your toughest kids are never absent.
Never. You won't like them all, and the tough ones show up for a reason.
It's the connection. It's the relationships.
And while you won't like them all, the key is, they can never, ever know it.
So teachers become great actors and great actresses, and we come to work when we don't feel like it, and we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense, and we teach anyway.
We teach anyway, because that's what we do.
Teaching and learning should bring joy.
How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks, who were not afraid to think, and who had a champion?
Every child deserves a champion, an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection, and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.
Is this job tough? You betcha. Oh God, you betcha.
But it is not impossible.
We can do this. We're educators.
We're born to make a difference.
Thank you so much.

It is a thrill to be here at a conference that's devoted to "Inspired by Nature" -- you can imagine.
And I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section.
Did you notice this section is foreplay?
Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters, which is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance.
I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park, which is a long, skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it, and my partner and I have a rowing shell.
And so we were rowing, and one of these Western Grebes came along.
And what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together, the two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater.
They paddle faster, and faster, and faster, until they're going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water, and they're standing upright, sort of paddling the top of the water.
And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing.
And so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly.
And this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect, and started to run along the water next to us, in a courtship dance -- for miles.
It would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start.
Now that is foreplay.
I came this close to changing species at that moment.
Obviously, life can teach us something in the entertainment section. Life has a lot to teach us.
But what I'd like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design.
What's happened since the book came out -- the book was mainly about research in biomimicry -- and what's happened since then is architects, designers, engineers -- people who make our world -- have started to call and say, we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us, in real time, become inspired.
Or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out into the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us.
So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater.
And some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there.
What they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry.
We use bacteria to clean our water. And we said, well, that's not exactly being inspired by nature.
That's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology: using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old, old technology called "domestication."
This is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it.
And so they still weren't getting it.
So we went for a walk on the beach and I said, well, give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge, sustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable.
And they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes.
And they said, you know what happens is, mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up.
And then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins, or we have to dig them up.
So if we had some way to stop this scaling -- and so I picked up some shells on the beach. And I asked them, what is scaling? What's inside your pipes?
And they said, calcium carbonate.
And I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate.
And they didn't know that.
They didn't know that what a seashell is, it's templated by proteins, and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell.
So the same sort of a process, without the proteins, is happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know.
This is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration.
You know, it's a silo, people in silos. They didn't know that the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it and said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- then why aren't shells infinite in size? What stops the scaling?
Why don't they just keep on going?
And I said, well, in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization -- and then they all sort of leaned in -- they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization.
It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal.
And, in fact, there is a product called TPA that's mimicked that protein -- that stop-protein -- and it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes.
That changed everything. From then on, you could not get these engineers back in the boat.
The first day they would take a hike, and it was, click, click, click, click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat.
We're done. You know, I've seen that island.
After this, they were crawling all over. They would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel.
What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve.
Learning about the natural world is one thing; learning from the natural world -- that's the switch.
That's the profound switch.
What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere; they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world.
3.8 billion years of field-testing.
10 to 30 -- Craig Venter will probably tell you; I think there's a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions.
The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context.
And the context is the Earth -- the same context that we're trying to solve our problems in.
So it's the conscious emulation of life's genius.
It's not slavishly mimicking -- although Al is trying to get the hairdo going -- it's not a slavish mimicry; it's taking the design principles, the genius of the natural world, and learning something from it.
Now, in a group with so many IT people, I do have to mention what I'm not going to talk about, and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things, on the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves, like an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation and biological development. And we're learning from neural nets, genetic algorithms, evolutionary computing.
That's on the software side. But what's interesting to me is that we haven't looked at this, as much. I mean, these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in Silicon Valley.
So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success.
So what can we learn about making -- not just computers, but everything?
The plane you came in, cars, the seats that you're sitting on.
How do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world?
More importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years?
And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has.
What's the syllabus?
Three questions, for me, are key.
How does life make things?
This is the opposite; this is how we make things.
It's called heat, beat and treat -- that's what material scientists call it.
And it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product. You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures; you use chemicals. OK. Heat, beat and treat.
Life can't afford to do that. How does life make things?
How does life make the most of things?
That's a geranium pollen.
And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape.
Life adds information to matter.
In other words: structure.
It gives it information. By adding information to matter, it gives it a function that's different than without that structure.
And thirdly, how does life make things disappear into systems?
Because life doesn't really deal in things; there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems.
Really quick syllabus.
As I'm reading more and more now, and following the story, there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences.
And at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are.
The two groups are not talking to each other.
At all.
What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture, to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in?
I'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly.
One that's exciting to me is self-assembly.
Now, you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology.
Back to that shell: the shell is a self-assembling material.
On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough.
It's twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics.
But what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns, it happens in seawater. It happens near, in and near, the organism's body.
This is Sandia National Labs.
A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process.
Imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something into a liquid, lifting it out of the liquid, and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together, so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works.
Imagine making all of our hard materials that way.
Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell, to a solar cell, onto a roof, and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light.
Here's an interesting one for the IT world: bio-silicon. This is a diatom, which is made of silicates.
And so silicon, which we make right now -- it's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips -- this is a bio-mineralization process that's now being mimicked.
This is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms.
This is from Ernst Haeckel's work.
Imagine being able to -- and, again, it's a templated process, and it solidifies out of a liquid process -- imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature.
Imagine being able to make perfect lenses.
On the left, this is a brittle star; it's covered with lenses that the people at Lucent Technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever.
It's one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of.
And there's many of them, all over its entire body.
What's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles.
A woman named Joanna Aizenberg, at Lucent, is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create these sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics.
That's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic.
Down at the very base of it, there's fiber optics that work better than ours, actually, to move light, but you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible.
Here's another big idea: CO2 as a feedstock.
A guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself, you know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time.
We see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose, right, out of CO2. He's found a way -- he's found a catalyst -- and he's found a way to take CO2 and make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics out of CO2 -- how plant-like.
Solar transformations: the most exciting one.
There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU. Even more interesting, lately, in the last couple of weeks, people have seen that there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons, and is able to take hydrogen up -- basically what's happening in a fuel cell, in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell.
In our fuel cells, we do it with platinum; life does it with a very, very common iron.
And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase.
That's very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without platinum.
Power of shape: here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them. And those little bumps actually increase efficiency in, for instance, the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent.
Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings, if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing.
Color without pigments: this peacock is creating color with shape.
Light comes through, it bounces back off the layers; it's called thin-film interference. Imagine being able to self-assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color.
Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface, so that it's self-cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does.
See that up-close picture?
That's a ball of water, and those are dirt particles.
And that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf.
There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics -- when the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps in a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building.
Water is going to be our big, grand challenge: quenching thirst.
Here are two organisms that pull water.
The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog.
The one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air, does not drink fresh water.
Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta, before it gets into a building, are key technologies.
Separation technologies are going to be extremely important.
What if we were to say, no more hard rock mining?
What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams, small amounts of metals in water? That's what microbes do; they chelate metals out of water.
There's a company here in San Francisco called MR3 that is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters to mine waste streams.
Green chemistry is chemistry in water.
We do chemistry in organic solvents.
This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful?
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book.
It's not easy, because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table.
And we use all of them, even the toxic ones.
To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table, and create miracle materials like that cell, is the task of green chemistry.
Timed degradation: packaging that is good until you don't want it to be good anymore, and dissolves on cue.
That's a mussel you can find in the waters out here, and the threads holding it to a rock are timed; at exactly two years, they begin to dissolve.
Healing: this is a good one.
That little guy over there is a tardigrade.
There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients. And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken; what's called the "cold chain" gets broken.
A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade -- which dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months and months and months, and is able to regenerate itself.
And he found a way to dry out vaccines -- encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells -- meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated.
They can be put in a glove compartment, OK.
Learning from organisms. This is a session about water -- learning about organisms that can do without water, in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration.
I'm not going to get to 12.
But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing, besides all of these adaptations, is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that's going to take care of their offspring.
When they're involved in foreplay, they're thinking about something very, very important -- and that's having their genetic material remain, 10,000 generations from now.
And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring.
That's the biggest design challenge.
Luckily, there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas.
Good luck having a conversation with them.
Thank you.
Talk about foreplay, I -- we need to get to 12, but really quickly.
Janine Benyus: Oh really?
Yeah. Just like, you know, like the 10-second version of 10, 11 and 12. Because we just -- your slides are so gorgeous, and the ideas are so big, I can't stand to let you go down without seeing 10, 11 and 12.
JB: OK, put this -- OK, I'll just hold this thing. OK, great.
OK, so that's the healing one.
Sensing and responding: feedback is a huge thing.
This is a locust. There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer, and yet they don't collide with one another.
And yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year.
Right. There's a person at Newcastle who has figured out that it's a very large neuron.
And she's actually figuring out how to make a collision-avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust.
This is a huge and important one, number 11.
And that's the growing fertility.
That means, you know, net fertility farming.
We should be growing fertility. And, oh yes -- we get food, too.
Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life.
And really, that's what other organisms do as well.
In ensemble, that's what whole ecosystems do: they create more and more opportunities for life.
Our farming has done the opposite.
So, farming based on how a prairie builds soil, ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range, even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water, but creates incredibly sparkling productivity.
This is the simple design brief. I mean, it looks simple because the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out.
That is, those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places, are not around to tell us about it.
That's the twelfth one.
Life -- and this is the secret trick; this is the magic trick -- life creates conditions conducive to life.
It builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water; it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live.
And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive.
We have to find a way to meet our needs, while making of this place an Eden.
Janine, thank you so much.

<title>Janine Benyus: Biomimicry's surprising lessons from nature's engineers</title>
<description>In this inspiring talk about recent developments in biomimicry, Janine Benyus provides heartening examples of ways in which nature is already influencing the products and systems we build.</description>
<keywords>DNA,animals,biology,biomimicry,design,environment,evolution,fish,science,technology</keywords>

We do not invest in victims, we invest in survivors.
And in ways both big and small, the narrative of the victim shapes the way we see women.
You can't count what you don't see.
And we don't invest in what's invisible to us.
But this is the face of resilience.
Six years ago, I started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict.
I set out to write a compelling economic story, one that had great characters, that no one else was telling, and one that I thought mattered.
And that turned out to be women.
I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30 for business school, a path I knew almost nothing about.
None of the women I had grown up with in Maryland had graduated from college, let alone considered business school.
But they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent.
And I saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling.
So if you're going to talk about jobs, then you have to talk about entrepreneurs.
And if you're talking about entrepreneurs in conflict and post-conflict settings, then you must talk about women, because they are the population you have left.
Rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide was 77 percent female.
I want to introduce you to some of those entrepreneurs I've met and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years.
I went to Afghanistan in 2005 to work on a Financial Times piece, and there I met Kamila, a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month -- an astronomical sum in that context.
And she had turned it down, she said, because she was going to start her next business, an entrepreneurship consultancy that would teach business skills to men and women all around Afghanistan.
Business, she said, was critical to her country's future.
Because long after this round of internationals left, business would help keep her country peaceful and secure.
And she said business was even more important for women because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women.
So I was amazed.
I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from "The Apprentice."
So I asked her, "How in the world do you know this much about business?
Why are you so passionate?"
She said, "Oh Gayle, this is actually my third business.
My first business was a dressmaking business I started under the Taliban.
And that was actually an excellent business, because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood.
And that's really how I became an entrepreneur."
Think about this: Here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets.
And at a time of economic collapse when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces and windows and doors just to survive, these girls made the difference between survival and starvation for so many.
I couldn't leave the story, and I couldn't leave the topic either, because everywhere I went I met more of these women who no one seemed to know about, or even wish to.
I went on to Bosnia, and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official who said, "You know, Gayle, I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia, but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road.
So maybe you could interview her."
So I went out reporting and within a day I met Narcisa Kavazovic who at that point was opening a new factory on the war's former front lines in Sarajevo.
She had started her business squatting in an abandoned garage, sewing sheets and pillow cases she would take to markets all around the city so that she could support the 12 or 13 family members who were counting on her for survival.
By the time we met, she had 20 employees, most of them women, who were sending their boys and their girls to school.
And she was just the start.
I met women running essential oils businesses, wineries and even the country's largest advertising agency.
So these stories together became the Herald Tribune business cover.
And when this story posted, I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official.
And I said, "Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs to feature at your next investment conference, here are a couple of women."
But think about this.
The IMF official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro.
The biases, whether intentional or otherwise, are pervasive, and so are the misleading mental images.
If you see the word "microfinance," what comes to mind?
Most people say women.
And if you see the word "entrepreneur," most people think men.
Why is that?
Because we aim low and we think small when it comes to women.
Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect, but we must move beyond micro-hopes and micro-ambitions for women, because they have so much greater hopes for themselves.
They want to move from micro to medium and beyond.
And in many places, they're there.
In the U.S., women-owned businesses will create five and a half million new jobs by 2018.
In South Korea and Indonesia, women own nearly half a million firms.
China, women run 20 percent of all small businesses.
And in the developing world overall, That figure is 40 to 50 percent.
Nearly everywhere I go, I meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs who are seeking access to finance, access to markets and established business networks.
They are often ignored because they're harder to help.
It is much riskier to give a 50,000 dollar loan than it is to give a 500 dollar loan.
And as the World Bank recently noted, women are stuck in a productivity trap.
Those in small businesses can't get the capital they need to expand and those in microbusiness can't grow out of them.
Recently I was at the State Department in Washington and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana.
She sells chocolates.
And she had come to Washington, not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan.
She had come seeking serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she needs to export her chocolates to Africa, Europe, the Middle East and far beyond -- capital that would help her to employ more than the 20 people that she already has working for her, and capital that would fuel her own country's economic climb.
The great news is we already know what works.
Theory and empirical evidence Have already taught us.
We don't need to invent solutions because we have them -- cash flow loans based in income rather than assets, loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral, because women often don't own land.
And Kiva.org, the microlender, is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing small and medium sized loans.
And that's just to start.
Recently it has become very much in fashion to call women "the emerging market of the emerging market."
I think that is terrific.
You know why?
Because -- and I say this as somebody who worked in finance -- 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade.
Because investors saw the potential for return at a time of slowing economic growth, and so they created financial products and financial innovation tailored to the emerging markets.
How wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets and invest 500 billion dollars unleashing women's economic potential?
Just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs, productivity, employment, child nutrition, maternal mortality, literacy and much, much more.
Because, as the World Economic Forum noted, smaller gender gaps are directly correlated with increased economic competitiveness.
And not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap -- not one.
So the great news is this is an incredible opportunity.
We have so much room to grow.
So you see, this is not about doing good, this is about global growth and global employment.
It is about how we invest and it's about how we see women.
And women can no longer be both half the population and a special interest group.
Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters who say to me, "Gayle, these are great stories, but you're really writing about the exceptions."
Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons.
First of all, for exceptions, there are a lot of them and they're important.
Secondly, when we talk about men who are succeeding, we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated.
And when we talk about women, they are either exceptions to be dismissed or aberrations to be ignored.
And finally, there is no society anywhere in all the world that is not changed except by its most exceptional.
So why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate these change makers and job creators rather than overlook them?
This topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life.
My mom was a single mom who worked at the phone company during the day and sold Tupperware at night so that I could have every opportunity possible.
We shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores, and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work, we even applied for food stamps.
And when I would feel sorry for myself as nine or 10 year-old girls do, she would say to me, "My dear, on a scale of major world tragedies, yours is not a three."
And when I was applying to business school and felt certain I couldn't do it and nobody I knew had done it, I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact.
And she told me, "Never import other people's limitations."
And when I complained to my grandmother, a World War II veteran who worked in film for 50 years and who supported me from the age of 13, that I was terrified that if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC for a fellowship overseas, I would never ever, ever find another job, she said, "Kiddo, I'm going to tell you two things.
First of all, no one turns down a Fulbright, and secondly, McDonald's is always hiring."
"You will find a job. Take the leap."
The women in my family are not exceptions.
The women in this room and watching in L.A.
and all around the world are not exceptions.
We are not a special interest group.
We are the majority.
And for far too long, we have underestimated ourselves and been undervalued by others.
It is time for us to aim higher when it comes to women, to invest more and to deploy our dollars to benefit women all around the world.
We can make a difference, and make a difference, not just for women, but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions.
Together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule.
When we change the way we see ourselves, others will follow.
And it is time for all of us to think bigger.
Thank you very much.

<title>Gayle Tzemach Lemmon: Women entrepreneurs, example not exception</title>
<description>Women aren't micro--so why do they only get micro-loans? Reporter Gayle Tzemach Lemmon argues that women running all types of firms-- from home businesses to major factories-- are the overlooked key to economic development. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

First of all, I'm a geek.
I'm an organic food-eating, carbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek.
And I really want to build green, but I'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles, people long on moral authority and short on data, telling me how to do these kinds of things.
And so I have to figure this out for myself.
For example: Is this evil?
I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self-actualized local cows on my counter top, and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.
But can I use a paper towel?
The answer to this can be found in embodied energy.
This is the amount of energy that goes into any paper towel or embodied water, and every time I use a paper towel, I am using this much virtual energy and water.
Wipe it up, throw it away.
Now, if I compare that to a cotton towel that I can use a thousand times, I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy until I wash that yogurty towel.
This is now operating energy.
So if I throw my towel in the washing machine, I've now put energy and water back into that towel ...
unless I use a front-loading, high-efficiency washing machine, and then it looks a little bit better.
But what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets?
Well, now a paper towel looks better.
Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge.
I wipe it up with a sponge, and I put it under the running water, and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water.
Unless you're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on, and then you start to use more energy.
Or worse, you let it run until it's warm to rinse out your towel.
And now all bets are off.
So what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the handle -- have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize.
Now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house.
That's what my husband and I are doing right now.
And so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?
And there's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade-offs.
And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room.
Now, the average house has about 300 megawatt hours of embodied energy in it; this is the energy it takes to make it -- millions and millions of paper towels.
We wanted to know how much better we could do.
And so, like many people, we start with a house on a lot, and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom.
So first, we demolish it.
It takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it -- you take it all apart, you use the bits -- you can get some of that energy back.
We then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent.
And then we poured a big foundation for passive solar.
Now, you can reduce the embodied energy by about 25 percent by using high fly ash concrete.
We then put in framing.
And so this is framing -- lumber, composite materials -- and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that, but it can be a sustainable resource if you use FSC-certified lumber.
We then go on to the first thing that was very surprising.
If we put aluminum windows in this house, we would double the energy use right there.
Now, PVC is a little bit better, but still not as good as the wood that we chose.
We then put in plumbing, electrical and HVAC, and insulate.
Now, spray foam is an excellent insulator -- it fills in all the cracks -- but it is pretty high embodied energy, and, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that.
We also used straw bale infill for our library, which has zero embodied energy.
When it comes time to sheetrock, if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock.
And then you get to the finishes, the subject of all of those "go green" articles, and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all.
And yet, all the press is focused on that.
Except for flooring.
If you put carpeting in your house, it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house, unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy.
So now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up, and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this.
But before we pat ourselves too much on the back, we have poured 151 megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before.
And so the question is: How could we make that back?
And so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward, compared with the old, non-energy-efficient house, we make it back in about six years.
Now, I probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient, and in that case, it would take me more about 20 years to break even.
Now, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy, it would have taken us over 50 years to break even compared to the upgraded house.
So what does this mean?
On the scale of my portion of the house, this is equivalent to about as much as I drive in a year, it's about five times as much as if I went entirely vegetarian.
But my elephant in the living room flies.
Clearly, I need to walk home from TED.
But all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog.
And, remember, it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are.
Thank you.

<title>Catherine Mohr: The tradeoffs of building green</title>
<description>In a short, funny, data-packed talk at U, Catherine Mohr walks through all the geeky decisions she made when building a green new house -- looking at real energy numbers, not hype. What choices matter most? Not the ones you think.</description>

So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl, "If you say a word often enough, it becomes you."
And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland, I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder -- thank God for technology -- to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words -- which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform -- if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America.
I was also inspired by Walt Whitman, who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.
So these four characters are going to be from that work that I've been doing for many years now, and well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people I've interviewed.
Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?
So I thought he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.
You know, he was "born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank, greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg, and bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century."
So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.
"Defining moment in American history, I don't think there's one; you can't say Hiroshima, that's a big one -- I can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment.
The gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the word used by the people in Watergate, moral slippage -- it's a gradual kind of thing, combination of things.
You see, we also have the technology.
I say, less and less the human touch.
"Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit.
The Atlanta airport is a modern airport, and they should leave the gate there.
These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.
And these trains are smooth, and they're quiet and they're efficient.
And there's a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice.
You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans.
Now we have humans imitating robots.
So we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln.
Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.
Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors.
And that voice, without losing a beat, says, 'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.' Just then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking.
Well, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding -- I do that to steel my nerves -- and so I imitate a train call, holding my hand on my -- 'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see.
Well, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs when I say that, but not on this train. Silence.
And so suddenly they're looking at me.
So here I am with the couple, the three of us shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know.
"Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother.
I know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion.
So I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby, holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof, I say to the baby, 'Sir or Madam, what is your considered opinion of the human species?' And the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly, starts laughing, starts busting out with this crazy little laugh.
I say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.' "But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.
You know, you see, you've got to question the official truth.
You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain -- you know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him.
We read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course.
I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.
Remember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did?
You see, here's Huck; he's an illiterate kid; he's had no schooling, but there's something in him.
And the official truth, the truth was, the law was, that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.
And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see.
And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman who owns them, and Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh -- that woman, that woman never did anybody any harm.
Ooh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal; he's going to do a terrible thing.' Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim.
'Anybody up on that raft with you?' Huck says, 'Yeah.' 'Is he black or white?' 'White.' And they go off.
And Huck said, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh, I did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing -- why do I feel so good?' "But it's the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck's been made of, you see, all been buried; it's all been buried.
So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.
So you ask about a defining moment -- ain't no defining moment in American history for me.
It's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now, where trivia becomes news.
And more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other.
Huh. You know, I don't know if you could use this or not, but I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says, 'We're more and more into communications and less and less into communication.' Okay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist."
And that's Studs Terkel.
So, talk about risk taking. I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes.
You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable -- well, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this, I like to inspire people.
But since this was called "risk taking," I'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in.
And I'm doing her because I think we think of risk, at a conference like this, as a good thing.
But there are certain other connotations to the word "risk," and the same thing about the word "nature." What is nature?
Maxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopher who's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy -- great, big philosophy kind of an organization -- I went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn't know, that she still wants to know.
And she said, "Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsey when I see the president of my university.
And I still feel as though I've got to get coffee for my male colleagues, even though I've outlived most of them."
And she said, "And then intellectually, I don't know enough about the negative imagination.
And September 11th certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate."
So this piece is about a negative imagination.
It raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is, and about what a risk can be.
And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women.
Everything I do is word for word off a tape.
And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems, and this is called "A Mirror to Her Mouth."
And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.
"I began to learn how to cover it up, because I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home.
I want everybody to think we were a normal family.
I mean we had all the materialistic things, but that didn't make my children pain any less; that didn't make their fears subside.
I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses.
And he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare.
And I failed them dramatically, because I allowed it to go on and on and on.
"But the night that Myesha got killed -- and the intensity just grew and grew and grew, until one night we came home from getting drugs, and he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her, and he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt.
He had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing that Myesha was having sex with her little brother and they was fondling each other -- that would be his reason.
I'm just talking about the particular night that she died.
And so he put her in the bathtub, and I was in the bedroom with the baby.
"And four months before this happened, four months before Myesha died, I thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him -- insane -- thinking that if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone.
And it didn't work, didn't work.
And I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic, who was four months old when I came to jail.
"And I was in the bedroom. Like I said, he had her in the bathroom and he -- he -- every time he hit her, she would fall.
And she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously, repeatedly.
I could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn't move.
I didn't even go and see what was happening.
I just sat there and listened.
And then he put her in the hallway.
He told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours.
And then he told her, get up.
And when she got up, she says she couldn't see.
Her face was bruised. She had a black eye.
All around her head was just swollen; her head was about two sizes of its own size.
I told him, 'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep.
"The next morning she was dead.
He went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited.
He says, 'She won't breathe.' I knew immediately that she was dead.
I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went in and I put a mirror to her mouth -- there was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth.
He said, he said, he said, 'We can't, we can't let nobody find out about this.' He say, 'You've got to help me.' I agree. I agree.
"I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years, so it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret.
So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her, that she was missing.
We told a security guard that she was missing, though she wasn't missing.
And we told the security guard what we had put on her and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guard that we had put on her.
"And then we got the baby and my other child, and we drove out to, like, I-95.
I was so petrified and so numb, all I could look was in the rear-view mirror.
And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway.
My own child, I let that happen to."
So that's an investigation of the negative imagination.
When I started this project called "On the Road: A Search For an American Character" with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America and find it in all its aspects -- bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers, drum majorettes -- but I sort of got tripped on race relations, because my first big show was a show about a race riot.
And so I went to both -- two race riots, one of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that.
Because this is what I would say I've learned the most about race relations, from this piece.
It's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.
Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King.
It was captured on videotape -- technology -- and it was played all over the world.
Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail.
They did not, so there were riots.
And what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial, ordered by George Bush, Sr.
And that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.
And I mean, the people just danced in the streets because they were afraid there was going to be another riot.
Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way.
So there was a community that didn't -- the Korean-Americans, whose stores had been burned to the ground.
And so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han, I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race.
And she asks also a question that Studs talks about: this notion of the "official truth," to question the "official truth."
So what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society.
And this is called, "Swallowing the Bitterness."
"I used to believe America was the best.
I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie.
I never saw any poor man, any black.
Until 1992, I used to believe America was the best -- I still do; I don't deny that because I am a victim.
But at the end of '92, when we were in such turmoil, and having all the financial problems, and all the mental problems, I began to really realize that Koreans are completely left out of this society and we are nothing.
Why? Why do we have to be left out?
We didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR, no welfare, anything. Many African-Americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive.
We didn't get any because we have a car and a house.
And we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice?
"OK. OK? OK. OK.
Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial.
I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict, and all the day they were having a party, they celebrated, all of South Central, all the churches. And they say, 'Well, finally justice has been done in this society.' Well, what about victims' rights?
They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants.
They have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King.
He is the only model for black community; I don't care Jesse Jackson.
He is the model of non-violence, non-violence -- and they would all like to be in his spirit.
"But what about 1992? They destroyed innocent people.
And I wonder if that is really justice for them, to get their rights in that way.
I was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them.
They became so hilarious, but I was happy for them.
I was glad for them. At least they got something back, OK.
Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims who were destroyed by them.
They fought for their rights for over two centuries, and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities, Hispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream.
That's why I understand; that's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.
"But I wish that, I wish that, I wish that I could be part of the enjoyment.
I wish that I could live together with black people.
But after the riot, it's too much difference.
The fire is still there. How do you say it? [Unclear].
Igniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire.
It's still there; it can burst out anytime."
Mrs. Young-Soon Han.
The other reason that I don't wear shoes is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody, walking really in somebody else's shoes.
And I told you that in -- you know, I didn't give you the year, but in '79 I thought that I was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that, and I got sidetracked on race relations.
Finally, I did find a bull rider, two years ago.
And I've been going to the rodeos with him, and we've bonded.
And he's the lead in an op-ed I did about the Republican Convention.
He's a Republican -- I won't say anything about my party affiliation, but anyway -- so this is my dear, dear Brent Williams, and this is on toughness, in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this.
And this is called "Toughness."
"Well, I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist.
I mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene, her family's always saying, you know, you ever think he's just a born loser?
It seems like he has so much bad luck, you know.
But then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know, I didn't lose my kidney -- I could have lost my kidney, I kept my kidney, so I don't think I'm a born loser.
I think that's good luck.
"And, I mean, funny things like this happen.
I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan, and there was a Reader's Digest, October 2002.
It was like, 'seven ways to get lucky.' And it says if you want to get lucky, you know, you've got to be around positive people.
I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking; she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.' "And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet.
She said, 'Look who she is.
You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.' And she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot because I've never been to college, and I wouldn't be talking professional or anything.
I said, 'Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours.
You know, if I wasn't talking -- you know, like, you know, she wanted me to talk, I don't think she would even come out here.' "Confidence? Well, I think I ride more out of determination than confidence.
I mean, confidence is like, you know, you've been on that bull before; you know you can ride him.
I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way.
But determination, you know, it's like just, you know, 'Fuck the form, get the horn.' That's Tuff Hedeman, in the movie '8 Seconds.' I mean, like, Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy, he say, 'You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.' And try and determination is the same thing.
Determination is, like, you're going to hang on that bull, even if you're riding upside down.
Determination's like, you're going to ride till your head hits the back of the dirt.
"Freedom? It would have to be the rodeo.
"Beauty? I don't think I know what beauty is.
Well, you know, I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too.
I mean, look how we are, the roughy family, palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me.
It's like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas.
We ride together, we, you know, we, we eat together and we sleep together.
I mean, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like the last day I rodeo. I mean, I'll be alright.
I mean, I have my ranch and everything, but I actually don't even want to think the day that comes.
I mean, I guess it just be like -- I guess it be like the day my brother died.
"Toughness? Well, we was in West Jordan, Utah, and this bull shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a -- you know, busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital.
And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out.
And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night, so I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia, or whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up.
And then they had to straighten out my nose, and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head, and everybody said that it should have killed me, but it didn't, because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain.
But the good thing was, once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out, I could breathe, and I hadn't been able to breathe since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo."
Thank you.

Well, I was introduced as the former Governor of Michigan, but actually I'm a scientist.
All right, a political scientist, it doesn't really count, but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy that is Michigan, and, like any good scientist, I was experimenting with policy about what would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number.
But there were three problems, three enigmas that I could not solve, and I want to share with you those problems, but most importantly, I think I figured out a proposal for a solution.
The first problem that not just Michigan, but every state, faces is, how do you create good jobs in America in a global economy?
So let me share with you some empirical data from my lab.
I was elected in 2002 and, at the end of my first year in office in 2003, I got a call from one of my staff members, who said, "Gov, we have a big problem.
We have a little tiny community called Greenville, Michigan, population 8,000, and they are about to lose their major employer, which is a refrigerator factory that's operated by Electrolux."
And I said, "Well, how many people work at Electrolux?"
And he said, "3,000 of the 8,000 people in Greenville."
So it is a one-company town.
And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico.
So I said, "Forget that. I'm the new Governor.
We can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make Electrolux an offer they can't refuse."
So I brought my whole cabinet, and we met with all of the pooh-bahs of little Greenville -- the mayor, the city manager, the head of the community college -- and we basically emptied our pockets and put all of our chips on the table, incentives, you name it, to convince Electrolux to stay, and as we made our pile of chips, we slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux.
And in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years, or that we'd help to build a new factory for the company, we'd help to finance it. The UAW, who represented the workers, said they would offer unprecedented concessions, sacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville.
So the management of Electrolux took our pile, our list of incentives, and they went outside the room for 17 minutes, and they came back in and they said, "Wow, this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here.
But there's nothing you can do to compensate for the fact that we can pay $1.57 an hour in Juarez, Mexico. So we're leaving."
And they did. And when they did, it was like a nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville.
In fact, they did implode the factory.
That's a guy that is walking on his last day of work.
And on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line, the employees of Electrolux in Greenville, Michigan, had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper.
It was in a big pavilion in Greenville, an indoor pavilion, and I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor that I couldn't stop the outflow of these jobs, and I wanted to grieve with them, and as I went into the room-- there's thousands of people there.
It was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches on roundtop tables, and there was a sad band playing music, or a band playing sad music, probably both.
And this guy comes up to me, and he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on, and he had his two daughters with him, and he said, "Gov, these are my two daughters."
He said, "I'm 48 years old, and I have worked at this factory for 30 years.
I went from high school to factory.
My father worked at this factory," he said.
"My grandfather worked at this factory.
All I know is how to make refrigerators."
And he looked at his daughters, and he puts his hand on his chest, and he says, "So, Gov, tell me, who is ever going to hire me?
Who is ever going to hire me?"
And that was asked not just by that guy but by everyone in the pavilion, and frankly, by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories that closed in the first decade of this century.
Enigma number one: How do you create jobs in America in a global economy?
Number two, very quickly: How do you solve global climate change when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm?
In fact, there was a poll that was done recently and the pollster compared Congress's approval ratings to a number of other unpleasant things, and it was found, in fact, that Congress's approval rating is worse than cockroaches, lice, Nickelback the band, root canals and Donald Trump.
But wait, the good news is it's at least better than meth labs and gonorrhea.
We got a problem, folks.
So it got me thinking, what is it?
What in the laboratory that I see out there, the laboratories of democracy, what has happened?
What policy prescriptions have happened that actually cause changes to occur and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way?
So if I asked you, for example, what was the Obama Administration policy that caused massive changes across the country, what would you say?
You might say Obamacare, except for those were not voluntary changes.
As we know, only half the states have opted in.
We might say the Recovery Act, but those didn't require policy changes.
The thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was Race to the Top for education.
Why? The government put a $4.5 billion pot and said to the governors across the country, compete for it.
Forty-eight governors competed, convincing 48 state legislatures to essentially raise standards for high schoolers so that they all take a college prep curriculum.
Forty-eight states opted in, creating a national [education] policy from the bottom up.
So I thought, well, why can't we do something like that and create a clean energy jobs race to the top?
Because after all, if you look at the context, 1.6 trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years from the private sector globally, and every dollar represents a job, and where are those jobs going?
Well, they're going to places that have policy, like China.
In fact, I was in China to see what they were doing, and they were putting on a dog-and-pony show for the group that I was with, and I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations and standing next to one of the Chinese officials, and we were watching, and he says, "So, Gov, when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy?"
And I said, "Oh my God -- Congress, gridlock, who knows?"
And this is what he did, he goes, he says, "Take your time."
Because they see our passivity as their opportunity.
So what if we decided to create a challenge to the governors of the country, and the price to entry into this competition used the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress for the Race to the Top for education, 4.5 billion, which sounds like a lot, but actually it's less than one tenth of one percent of federal spending.
It's a rounding error on the federal side.
But price to entry into that competition would be, you could just, say, use the President's goal.
He wants Congress to adopt a clean energy standard of 80 percent by 2030, in other words, that you'd have to get 80 percent of your energy from clean sources by the year 2030.
Why not ask all of the states to do that instead?
And imagine what might happen, because every region has something to offer.
You might take states like Iowa and Ohio -- two very important political states, by the way -- those two governors, and they would say, we're going to lead the nation in producing the wind turbines and the wind energy.
You might say the solar states, the sun belt, we're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country, and maybe Jerry Brown says, "Well, I'm going to create an industry cluster in California to be able to produce the solar panels so that we're not buying them from China but we're buying them from the U.S."
In fact, every region of the country could do this.
You see, you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation.
In fact, if you look just at the upper and northern states in the West, they could do geothermal, or you could look at Texas and say, we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid.
In the middle eastern states which have access to forests and to agricultural waste, they might say, we're going to lead the nation in biofuels.
In the upper northeast, we're going to lead the nation in energy efficiency solutions.
Along the eastern seaboard, we're going to lead the nation in offshore wind.
You might look at Michigan and say, we're going to lead the nation in producing the guts for the electric vehicle, like the lithium ion battery.
Every region has something to offer, and if you created a competition, it respects the states and it respects federalism.
It's opt-in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina, who didn't opt into the education Race to the Top, you might even get them to opt in. Why?
Because Republican and Democratic governors love to cut ribbons.
We want to bring jobs. I'm just saying.
And it fosters innovation at the state level in these laboratories of democracy.
Now, any of you who are watching anything about politics lately might say, "Okay, great idea, but really?
Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table?
They can't agree to anything."
So you could wait and go through Congress, although you should be very impatient.
Or, you renegades, we could go around Congress.
Go around Congress.
What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors?
What if several of the high-net worth companies and individuals who are here at TED decided that they would create, band together, just a couple of them, and create a national competition to the governors to have a race to the top and see how the governors respond?
What if it all started here at TED?
What if you were here when we figured out how to crack the code to create good paying jobs in America -- -- and get national energy policy and we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up?
Because, dear TEDsters, if you are impatient like I am, you know that our economic competitors, our other nations, are in the game and are eating us for lunch.
And we can get in the game or not.
We can be at the table or we can be on the table.
And I don't know about you, but I prefer to dine.
Thank you all so much.

I'm going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy: social media and the end of gender.
Let me connect the dots.
I'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love, or love to hate, are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender.
I think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender.
If you hadn't noticed, our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender, and I think that's going to change.
Now most media companies -- television, radio, publishing, games, you name it -- they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences.
It's old-school demographics.
They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us.
Now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways -- you have certain taste, that you like certain things.
And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics.
Age demographics: the 18 to 49 demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the 1960s, when the baby boomers were still young.
Now they've aged out of that demographic, but it's still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don't even take into account viewers of television shows over age 54.
In our media environment, it's as if they don't even exist.
Now, if you watch "Mad Men," like I do -- it's a popular TV show in the States -- Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics, which first came about in the 1960s, where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers.
But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business.
It's really just been basic demographics.
So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC, and we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years on demographics and how they affect media and entertainment in this country and abroad.
And in the last three years, we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed, and we've discovered some very interesting things.
All the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them.
But those categories mean even less now than they did before, because with online networking tools, it's much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes.
We're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online.
And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.
We can also connect with people based on our very specific interests.
We don't need a media company to help do this for us.
So the traditional media companies, of course, are paying very close attention to these online communities.
They know this is the mass audience of the future; they need to figure it out.
But they're having a hard time doing it because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them, because that's how ad rates are still determined.
When they're monitoring your clickstream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time figuring out your age, your gender and your income.
They can make some educated guesses.
But they get a lot more information about what you do online, what you like, what interests you.
That's easier for them to find out than who you are.
And even though that's still sort of creepy, there is an upside to having your taste monitored.
Suddenly our taste is being respected It had been presumed before.
So when you look online at the way people aggregate, they don't aggregate around age, gender and income.
They aggregate around the things they love, the things that they like, and if you think about it, shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories.
I'd much rather know whether you like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" rather than how old you are.
That would tell me something more substantial about you.
Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising.
It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution.
If you look at the statistics -- these are worldwide statistics -- in every single age category, women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies.
And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites, they truly dominate the social media space, which is a space that's having a huge impact on old media.
The question is: what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture, and what's it going to mean for women?
If the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media, then does that mean that women are going to take over global media?
Are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on TV shows?
Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks?
Could this be possible, that suddenly our media landscape will become a feminist landscape?
Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case.
I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women, because they realize this is important for their business, and I think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere.
But I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough -- responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the "chick flick" and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things -- that Hispanics like certain things, that young people like certain things.
This is far too simplistic.
The future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data-driven, and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online, where women are really driving the action.
So you may be asking, well why is it important that I know what entertains people?
Why should I know this?
Of course, old media companies and advertisers need to know this.
But my argument is that, if you want to understand the global village, it's probably a good idea that you figure out what they're passionate about, what amuses them, what they choose to do in their free time.
This is a very important thing to know about people.
I've spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people's lives.
And I do it not just because it's fun -- though actually, it is really fun -- but also because our research has shown over and over again that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people's lives -- for instance, on their political beliefs and on their health.
And so, if you have any interest in understanding the world, looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start.
So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics.
Can you even imagine what that looks like?
I can't wait to find out what it looks like.

<title>Johanna Blakley: Social media and the end of gender</title>
<description>Media and advertising companies still use the same old demographics to understand audiences, but they're becoming increasingly harder to track online, says media researcher Johanna Blakley. As social media outgrows traditional media, and women users outnumber men, Blakley explains what changes are in store for the future of media.</description>

What you're doing, right now, at this very moment, is killing you.
More than cars or the Internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about, the technology you're using the most almost every day is this, your tush.
Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day, which is more than we're sleeping, at 7.7 hours.
Sitting is so incredibly prevalent, we don't even question how much we're doing it, and because everyone else is doing it, it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay.
In that way, sitting has become the smoking of our generation.
Of course there's health consequences to this, scary ones, besides the waist.
Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical [activity], Ten percent in fact, on both of those.
Six percent for heart disease, seven percent for type 2 diabetes, which is what my father died of.
Now, any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more, but if you're anything like me, it won't.
What did get me moving was a social interaction.
Someone invited me to a meeting, but couldn't manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting, and said, "I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then?"
It seemed kind of odd to do, and actually, that first meeting, I remember thinking, "I have to be the one to ask the next question," because I knew I was going to huff and puff during this conversation.
And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own.
So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings, I ask people to go on a walking meeting, to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week.
It's changed my life.
But before that, what actually happened was, I used to think about it as, you could take care of your health, or you could take care of obligations, and one always came at the cost of the other.
So now, several hundred of these walking meetings later, I've learned a few things.
First, there's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out-of-the-box thinking.
Whether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works.
And second, and probably the more reflective one, is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they're really not that way.
And if we're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently, whether it's in governance or business or environmental issues, job creation, maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true.
Because it was when that happened with this walk-and-talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable.
So I started this talk talking about the tush, so I'll end with the bottom line, which is, walk and talk.
Walk the talk.
You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking, and in the way that you do, you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas.
Thank you.

This is how war starts.
One day you're living your ordinary life, you're planning to go to a party, you're taking your children to school, you're making a dentist appointment.
The next thing, the telephones go out, the TVs go out, there's armed men on the street, there's roadblocks.
Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation.
It stops.
I'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine, a Bosnian friend, about what happened to her, because I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like.
She was walking to work one day in April, 1992, in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank.
She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party.
Great person.
And suddenly she sees a tank ambling down the main road of Sarajevo knocking everything out of its path.
She thinks she's dreaming, but she's not.
And she runs as any of us would have done and takes cover, and she hides behind a trash bin, in her high heels and her miniskirt.
And as she's hiding there, she's feeling ridiculous, but she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers and people all over the place and chaos and she thinks, "I feel like Alice in Wonderland going down the rabbit hole, down, down, down into chaos, and my life will never be the same again."
A few weeks later, my friend was in a crowd of people pushing with her infant son in her arms to give him to a stranger on a bus, which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo to take children out so they could be safe.
And she remembers struggling with her mother to the front, crowds and crowds of people, "Take my child! Take my child!"
and passing her son to someone through a window.
And she didn't see him for years.
The siege went on for three and a half years, and it was a siege without water, without power, without electricity, without heat, without food, in the middle of Europe, in the middle of the 20th century.
I had the honor of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege, and I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there because it's taught me everything, not just about being a reporter, but about being a human being.
I learned about compassion.
I learned about ordinary people who could be heroes.
I learned about sharing. I learned about camaraderie.
Most of all, I learned about love.
Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos, I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors, share food, raise their children, drag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life, helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals.
I learned so much about myself.
Martha Gellhorn, who's one of my heroes, once said, "You can only love one war. The rest is responsibility."
I went on to cover many, many, many wars after that, so many that I lost count, but there was nothing like Sarajevo.
Last April, I went back to a very strange -- what I called a deranged high school reunion.
What it was, was the 20th anniversary of the siege, the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo, and I don't like the word "anniversary," because it sounds like a party, and this was not a party.
It was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war, humanitarian aid workers, and of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves.
And the thing that struck me the most, that broke my heart, was walking down the main street of Sarajevo, where my friend Aida saw the tank coming 20 years ago, and in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs, empty, and every single one of them symbolized a person who had died during the siege, just in Sarajevo, not in all of Bosnia, and it stretched from one end of the city to a large part of it, and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs for the children.
I now cover Syria, and I started reporting it because I believed that it needs to be done.
I believe a story there has to be told.
I see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia.
And when I first arrived in Damascus, I saw this strange moment where people didn't seem to believe that war was going to descend, and it was exactly the same in Bosnia and nearly every other country I've seen where war comes.
People don't want to believe it's coming, so they don't leave, they don't leave before they can.
They don't get their money out.
They stay because you want to stay in your home.
And then war and chaos descend.
Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot.
In 1994, I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda.
Between April and August, 1994, one million people were slaughtered.
Now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out with the sheer number, I want you just for a second to think of a million people.
And to give you some example, I remember standing and looking down a road as far as I could see, at least a mile, and there were bodies piled twice my height of the dead.
And that was just a small percentage of the dead.
And there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in their last death throes.
So we learn a lot from war, and I mention Rwanda because it is one place, like South Africa, where nearly 20 years on, there is healing.
Fifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women, which is fantastic, and there's also within the national constitution now, you're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi.
You're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity, which is, of course, what started the slaughter in the first place.
And an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story, or I find it beautiful.
There was a group of children, mixed Hutus and Tutsis, and a group of women who were adopting them, and they lined up and one was just given to the next.
There was no kind of compensation for, you're a Tutsi, you're a Hutu, you might have killed my mother, you might have killed my father.
They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation, and I find this remarkable.
So when people ask me how I continue to cover war, and why I continue to do it, this is why.
When I go back to Syria, next week in fact, what I see is incredibly heroic people, some of them fighting for democracy, for things we take for granted every single day.
And that's pretty much why I do it.
In 2004, I had a little baby boy, and I call him my miracle child, because after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life, this ray of hope was born.
And I called him Luca, which means "The bringer of light," because he does bring light to my life.
But I'm talking about him because when he was four months old, my foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad where I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime and during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards, and I remember getting on the plane in tears, crying to be separated from my son, and while I was there, a quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine said to me, "What are you doing here?
Why aren't you home with Luca?"
And I said, "Well, I have to see." It was 2004 which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq, "I have to see, I have to see what is happening here.
I have to report it."
And he said, "Go home, because if you miss his first tooth, if you miss his first step, you'll never forgive yourself.
But there will always be another war."
And there, sadly, will always be wars.
And I am deluding myself if I think, as a journalist, as a reporter, as a writer, what I do can stop them. I can't.
I'm not Kofi Annan. He can't stop a war.
He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it.
I'm not a U.N. conflict resolution person.
I'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor, and I can't tell you the times of how helpless I've felt to have people dying in front of me, and I couldn't save them.
All I am is a witness.
My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless.
A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world.
And that's what I try to do.
I'm not always successful, and sometimes it's incredibly frustrating, because you feel like you're writing into a void, or you feel like no one cares.
Who cares about Syria? Who cares about Bosnia?
Who cares about the Congo, the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone, all of these strings of places that I will remember for the rest of my life?
But my métier is to bear witness and that is the crux, the heart of the matter, for us reporters who do this.
And all I can really do is hope, not to policymakers or politicians, because as much as I'd like to have faith that they read my words and do something, I don't delude myself.
But what I do hope is that if you remember anything I said or any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast, if you can remember the story of Sarajevo, or the story of Rwanda, then I've done my job.
Thank you very much.

The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front pages.
It, however, is enormous in both scale and importance.
Look, you all are very well traveled; this is TEDGlobal after all.
But I do hope to take you to some places you've never been to before.
So, let's start off in China.
This photo was taken two weeks ago.
Actually, one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school.
But this is Tiananmen Square.
Many of you have been there. It's not the real China.
Let me take you to the real China.
This is in the Dabian Mountains in the remote part of Hubei province in central China.
Dai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts.
She lives with her parents, her two brothers and her great-aunt.
They have a hut that has no electricity, no running water, no wristwatch, no bicycle.
And they share this great splendor with a very large pig.
Dai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said, "We're going to pull you out of school because the 13-dollar school fees are too much for us.
You're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies.
Why would we waste this money on you?"
This is what happens to girls in remote areas.
Turns out that Dai Manju was the best pupil in her grade.
She still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors.
We wrote about her in The New York Times.
We got a flood of donations -- mostly 13-dollar checks because New York Times readers are very generous in tiny amounts but then, we got a money transfer for $10,000 -- really nice guy.
We turned the money over to that man there, the principal of the school.
He was delighted.
He thought, "Oh, I can renovate the school.
I can give scholarships to all the girls, you know, if they work hard and stay in school.
So Dai Manju basically finished out middle school.
She went to high school.
She went to vocational school for accounting.
She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south.
She found a job, she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends.
She sent money back to her family.
They built a new house, this time with running water, electricity, a bicycle, no pig.
What we saw was a natural experiment.
It is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls' education.
And over the years, as we followed Dai Manju, we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle.
She not only changed her own dynamic, she changed her household, she changed her family, her village.
The village became a real standout.
Of course, most of China was flourishing at the time, but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of China.
And that brings me to my first major of two tenets of "Half the Sky."
And that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity.
In the 19th century, it was slavery.
In the 20th century, it was totalitarianism.
The cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender.
So some of you may be thinking, "Gosh, that's hyperbole.
She's exaggerating."
Well, let me ask you this question.
How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world?
Let me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world?
Hands up, please.
How many of you think -- a few -- how many of you there are more females in the world?
Okay, most of you.
Well, you know this latter group, you're wrong.
There are, true enough, in Europe and the West, when women and men have equal access to food and health care, there are more women, we live longer.
But in most of the rest of the world, that's not the case.
In fact, demographers have shown that there are anywhere between 60 million and 100 million missing females in the current population.
And, you know, it happens for several reasons.
For instance, in the last half-century, more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the 20th century.
Sometimes it's also because of the sonogram.
Girls get aborted before they're even born when there are scarce resources.
This girl here, for instance, is in a feeding center in Ethiopia.
The entire center was filled with girls like her.
What's remarkable is that her brothers, in the same family, were totally fine.
In India, in the first year of life, from zero to one, boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast, and the breast shows no son preference.
From one to five, girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate than boys, in all of India.
The second tenet of "Half the Sky" is that, let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all, and just on a purely practical level, we think that one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism is to educate girls and to bring women into the formal labor force.
Poverty, for instance.
There are three reasons why this is the case.
For one, overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty.
And you know, when you educate a boy, his family tends to have fewer kids, but only slightly.
When you educate a girl, she tends to have significantly fewer kids.
The second reason is it has to do with spending.
It's kind of like the dirty, little secret of poverty, which is that, not only do poor people take in very little income, but also, the income that they take in, they don't spend it very wisely, and unfortunately, most of that spending is done by men.
So research has shown, if you look at people who live under two dollars a day -- one metric of poverty -- two percent of that take-home pay goes to this basket here, in education.
20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol, tobacco, sugary drinks -- and prostitution and festivals.
If you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket, you would have a transformative effect.
The last reason has to do with women being part of the solution, not the problem.
You need to use scarce resources.
It's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju.
Bill Gates put it very well when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia.
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves.
However, two-thirds of the way there was a barrier.
On this side was men, and then the barrier, and this side was women.
And someone from this side of the room got up and said, "Mr. Gates, we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia to be one of the top 10 countries when it comes to technology.
Do you think we'll make it?"
So Bill Gates, as he was staring out at the audience, he said, "If you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country, there is no way you will get anywhere near the top 10."
So here is Bill of Arabia.
So what would some of the specific challenges look like?
I would say, on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking.
And I'll just say two things about this.
The slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the 1780s: there were about 80,000 slaves transported from Africa to the New World.
Now, modern slavery: according to State Department rough statistics, there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number -- that are trafficked across international borders.
And that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders, which is a substantial portion.
And if you look at another factor, another contrast, a slave back then is worth about $40,000 in today's money.
Today, you can buy a girl trafficked for a few hundred dollars, which means she's actually more disposable.
But you know, there is progress being made in places like Cambodia and Thailand.
We don't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed.
The second item on the agenda is maternal mortality.
You know, childbirth in this part of the world is a wonderful event.
In Niger, one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth.
Around the world, one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth.
You know, it's not as though we don't have the technological solution, but these women have three strikes against them: they are poor, they are rural and they are female.
You know, for every woman who does die, there are 20 who survive but end up with an injury.
And the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula.
It's a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent.
Let me tell you about Mahabuba.
She lives in Ethiopia.
She was married against her will at age 13.
She got pregnant, ran to the bush to have the baby, but you know, her body was very immature, and she ended up having obstructed labor.
The baby died, and she ended up with a fistula.
So that meant she was incontinent; she couldn't control her wastes.
In a word, she stank.
The villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her.
So finally, they put her at the edge of the village in a hut.
They ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night.
That night, there was a stick in the hut.
She fought off the hyenas with that stick.
And the next morning, she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary, she would be saved.
Because she had some damage to her nerves, she crawled all the way -- 30 miles -- to that doorstep, half dead.
The foreign missionary opened the door, knew exactly what had happened, took her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa, and she was repaired with a 350-dollar operation.
The doctors and nurses there noticed that she was not only a survivor, she was really clever, and they made her a nurse.
So now, Mahabuba, she is saving the lives of hundreds, thousands, of women.
She has become part of the solution, not the problem.
She's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle.
I've talked about some of the challenges, let me talk about some of the solutions, and there are predictable solutions.
I've hinted at them: education and also economic opportunity.
So of course, when you educate a girl, she tends to get married later on in life, she tends to have kids later on in life, she tends to have fewer kids, and those kids that she does have, she educates them in a more enlightened fashion.
With economic opportunity, it can be transformative.
Let me tell you about Saima.
She lives in a small village outside Lahore, Pakistan.
And at the time, she was miserable.
She was beaten every single day by her husband, who was unemployed.
He was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable, therefore -- and took his frustrations out on her.
Well, when she had her second daughter, her mother in-law told her son, "I think you'd better get a second wife.
Saima's not going to produce you a son."
This is when she had her second daughter.
At the time, there was a microlending group in the village that gave her a 65-dollar loan.
Saima took that money, and she started an embroidery business.
The merchants liked her embroidery; it sold very well, and they kept asking for more.
And when she couldn't produce enough, she hired other women in the village.
Pretty soon she had 30 women in the village working for her embroidery business.
And then, when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace, she needed someone to help her do the transport, so she hired her husband.
So now they're in it together.
He does the transportation and distribution, and she does the production and sourcing.
And now they have a third daughter, and the daughters, all of them, are being tutored in education because Saima knows what's really important.
Which brings me to the final element, which is education.
Larry Summers, when he was chief economist at the World Bank, once said that, "It may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls' education."
Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira.
Beatrice was living in Uganda near the Congo border, and like Dai Manju, she didn't go to school.
Actually, she had never been to school, not to a lick, one day.
Her parents, again, said, "Why should we spend the money on her?
She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth."
Well, it just so happens, at that time, there was a group in Connecticut called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut.
They made a donation to an organization based in Arkansas called Heifer International.
Heifer sent two goats to Africa.
One of them ended up with Beatrice's parents, and that goat had twins.
The twins started producing milk.
They sold the milk for cash.
The cash started accumulating, and pretty soon the parents said, "You know, we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school."
So at nine years of age, Beatrice started in first grade -- after all, she'd never been to a lick of school -- with a six year-old.
No matter, she was just delighted to be in school.
She rocketed to the top of her class.
She stayed at the top of her class through elementary school, middle school, and then in high school, she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village, ever, to come to the United States on scholarship.
Two years ago, she graduated from Connecticut College.
On the day of her graduation, she said, "I am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat."
And that goat was $120.
So you see how transformative little bits of help can be.
But I want to give you a reality check.
Look: U.S. aid, helping people is not easy, and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid.
There's Bill Easterly's book.
There's a book called "Dead Aid."
You know, the criticism is fair; it isn't easy.
You know, people say how half of all water well projects, a year later, are failed.
When I was in Zimbabwe, we were touring a place with the village chief -- he wanted to raise money for a secondary school -- and there was some construction a few yards away, and I said, "What's that?"
He sort of mumbled.
Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project.
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop.
One year, all the chickens died, and no one wanted to put the chickens in there.
It's true, but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater; you actually improve.
You learn from your mistakes, and you continuously improve.
We also think that individuals can make a difference, and they should, because individuals, together, we can all help create a movement.
And a movement of men and women is what's needed to bring about social change, change that will address this great moral challenge.
So then, I ask, what's in it for you?
You're probably asking that. Why should you care?
I will just leave you with two things.
One is that research shows that once you have all of your material needs taken care of -- which most of us, all of us, here in this room do -- research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness.
One of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself.
And the second thing, it's an anecdote that I'll leave you with.
And that is the story of an aid worker in Darfur.
Here was a woman who had worked in Darfur, seeing things that no human being should see.
Throughout her time there, she was strong, she was steadfast.
She never broke down.
And then she came back to the United States and was on break, Christmas break.
She was in her grandmother's backyard, and she saw something that made her break down in tears.
What that was was a bird feeder.
And she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted, where we not only can feed, clothe and house ourselves, but also provide for wild birds so they don't go hungry in the winter.
And she realized that with that great fortune comes great responsibility.
And so, like her, you, me, we have all won the lottery of life.
And so the question becomes: how do we discharge that responsibility?
So, here's the cause.
Join the movement.
Feel happier and help save the world.
Thank you very much.

Okay, so 90 percent of my photographic process is, in fact, not photographic.
It involves a campaign of letter writing, research and phone calls to access my subjects, which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in West Virginia.
And oddly, the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World, a seemingly innocuous site.
And it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence: "Especially during these violent times, I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to."
Photography threatens fantasy.
They didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs, and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth.
But there are multiple truths attached to every image, depending on the creator's intention, the viewer and the context in which it is presented.
Over a five year period following September 11th, when the American media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders, most notably weapons of mass destruction, I chose to look inward at that which was integral to America's foundation, mythology and daily functioning.
I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen, self-imposed and real, and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge.
It was a critical moment in American history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes, but what I came away with is a photograph.
And it's just another place from which to observe, and the understanding that there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.
And the outsider can never really reach the core.
I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.
It's titled, "An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar," and it's comprised of nearly 70 images.
In this context I'll just show you a few.
This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at Hanford site in Washington State, where there are over 1,900 stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water.
A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.
And I found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the United States of America, which you can see here.
And a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text.
So I create these two poles.
Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.
And what I'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image, and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image.
So, at best, the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.
And then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground.
But in this context I'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts.
This is a cryopreservation unit, and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger, who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health, with advancements in science and technology, all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.
This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty.
Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state, allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage.
So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen, allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse, to simulate the loss of virginity.
This is a jury simulation deliberation room, and you can see beyond that two-way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.
And they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they're hoping for.
This process costs 60,000 dollars.
This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room, a contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.
On that table you can see 48 hours' worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.
There is a pig's head and African cane rats.
And part of my photographic work is I'm not just documenting what's there.
I do take certain liberties and intervene.
And in this I really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting, so I spent some time with the smells and items.
This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA in Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.
And the CIA has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts.
And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter Soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro-American thoughts and aesthetics.
And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency, and had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.
This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility, and on a six acre plot there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition.
And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene.
This is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the United States.
It's a research crop marijuana grow room.
And part of the work that I hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things -- they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security -- and you can't completely understand how information is being distributed.
These are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, connecting North America to Europe.
They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations, and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability.
This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.
But stuff did feel like it could have been taken 30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era and hadn't necessarily progressed.
This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.
And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired, and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity.
And Playboy is always in the top few.
But you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs. It's just the text.
This is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into America are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine, where they are tested for diseases including Exotic Newcastle Disease and Avian Influenza.
This film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead.
And the Air Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air-delivered weaponry coming from the United States.
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film.
And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film.
All living white tigers in North America are the result of selective inbreeding -- that would be mother to son, father to daughter, sister to brother -- to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger.
Meaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose.
And the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth.
It's a very violent process that is little known.
And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment.
Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood.
He has since passed away, but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities.
This, on a lighter note, is at George Lucas' personal archive.
This is the Death Star.
And it's shown here in its true orientation.
In the context of "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi," its mirror image is presented.
They flip the negative.
And you can see the photoetched brass detailing, and the painted acrylic facade.
In the context of the film, this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire, capable of annihilating planets and civilizations, and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.
This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.
It's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site.
Essentially they've simulated a city for urban combat, and this is one of the structures that exists in that city.
It's called the World Church of God.
It's supposed to be a generic site of worship.
And after I took this photograph, they constructed a wall around the World Church of God to mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.
And I worked with Mehta Vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice.
And we put that wall around the World Church of God, and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army.
And I put them into my photograph.
This is live HIV virus at Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government to develop sterilizing immunity.
And Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored Arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world.
It runs 24 hours a day, commercial free.
However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.
And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq, which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq and is broadcast to Iraq.
Now I'm going to move on to another project I did.
It's titled "The Innocents."
And for the men in these photographs, photography had been used to create a fantasy.
Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth, in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.
I traveled across the United States photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.
I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction, and its influence on memory, which can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.
For the men in these photographs, the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification.
A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images.
But through exposure to composite sketches, Polaroids, mug shots and line-ups, eyewitness testimony can change.
I'll give you an example from a case.
A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker.
She saw some similarities in one of the photographs, but couldn't quite make a positive identification.
Days later, she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs, except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array.
And a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory, if there ever was an actual memory.
Photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals, and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications.
Frederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location, where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.
He was convicted by an all-white jury of rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.
And he served 10 years of a life sentence.
Now DNA exonerated Frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison.
But the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.
Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder of a young girl walking to school.
He served 18 years of a death sentence.
I photographed him at the scene of the crime at the Snake River in Idaho.
And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction.
The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification, the alibi location.
And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place to which he's never been, but changed his life forever.
So photographing there, I was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction, in both his life and in photography.
Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder.
He served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.
Larry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest, where he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana, in this very room to hide from the police.
He ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.
The victim failed to identify Larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification, days later, from a photo array.
Larry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a 10 year old boy at a carnival.
He is photographed at his alibi location.
Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club, and served 11 years of a death sentence.
I photographed Ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's to play professional baseball just before his conviction.
And the state's key witness in Ron's case was, in the end, the actual perpetrator.
Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman.
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago.
William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary.
He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky.
Timothy Durham, who I photographed at his alibi location where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime, was convicted of 3.5 years of a 3220 year sentence, for several charges of rape and robbery.
He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.
Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia.
He was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery, and served seven years of a 47 year sentence.
Troy's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward, but said he looked too old.
The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb from four years earlier, which they entered into a photo array days later, and he was positively identified.
Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.
And it reiterates that distortion is a constant, and our eyes are easily deceived.
That's it. Thank you.

<title>Taryn Simon: Photographs of secret sites</title>
<description>Taryn Simon exhibits her startling take on photography -- to reveal worlds and people we would never see otherwise. She shares two projects: one documents otherworldly locations typically kept secret from the public, the other involves haunting portraits of men convicted for crimes they did not commit.</description>
<keywords>adventure,art,arts,culture,curiosity,photography</keywords>

So, I'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit.
Forty-two million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2010.
Now, there was nothing particularly special about 2010, because, on average, 31 and a half million people are displaced by natural disasters every single year.
Now, usually when people hear statistics or stats like that, you start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of right here in the United States every single year.
Last year alone, 99 federally declared disasters were on file with FEMA, from Joplin, Missouri, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently.
Now, how does the most powerful country in the world handle these displaced people?
They cram them onto cots, put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag, stick it underneath, and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena, or a gymnasium.
So obviously there's a massive housing gap, and this really upset me, because academia tells you after a major disaster, there's typically about an 18-month time frame to -- we kinda recover, start the recovery process, but what most people don't realize is that on average it takes 45 to 60 days or more for the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up.
Before that time, people are left to their own devices.
So I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way to actually fill this gap.
This actually became my creative obsession.
I put aside all my freelance work after hours and started just focusing particularly on this problem.
So I started sketching.
Two days after Katrina, I started sketching and sketching and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this, and as things started to congeal or ideas started to form, I started sketching digitally on the computer, but it was an obsession, so I couldn't just stop there.
I started experimenting, making models, talking to experts in the field, taking their feedback, and refining, and I kept on refining and refining for nights and weekends for over five years.
Now, my obsession ended up driving me to create full-size prototypes in my own backyard — — and actually spending my own personal savings on everything from tooling to patents and a variety of other costs, but in the end I ended up with this modular housing system that can react to any situation or disaster.
It can be put up in any environment, from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields, because it doesn't require any special setup or specialty tools.
Now, at the foundation and kind of the core of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit, which is just the individual shelter module.
And though it's light, light enough that you can actually lift it by hand and move it around, and it actually sleeps four people.
And you can arrange these things as kind of more or you can circle the wagons, essentially, and form these circular pods out of them, which give you this semi-private communal area for people to actually spill out into so they're not actually trapped inside these units.
Now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters, because gone are the horrid conditions inside a sports arena or a gymnasium, where people are crammed on these cots inside.
Now we have instant neighborhoods outside.
So the Exo is designed to be simply, basically like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together so we get extremely efficient transportation and storage out of them.
In fact, 15 Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself.
This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option available today.
But I'm obsessive, so I couldn't just stop there, so I actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving, so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location.
The doors can actually swap out, so you can actually put on a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control, or a connector module that would allow you to actually connect multiple units together, which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces, so now this same kit of parts, this same unit can actually serve as a living room, bedroom or bathroom, or an office, a living space and secure storage.
Sounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real?
So the first idea I had, initially, was just to go the federal and state governments and go, "Here, take it, for free."
But I was quickly told that, "Boy, our government doesn't really work like that."
Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit to kind of help consult and get this idea going along with the government, but then I was told, "Son, our government looks to private sector for things like this."
Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go to private corporations that would have this mutually shared benefit to it, but I was quickly told by some corporations that my personal passion project was not a brand fit because they didn't want their logos stamped across the ghettos of Haiti.
Now, I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged.
So I decided, kind of told myself, "Oh yeah? Watch this. I'll do it myself."
Now, this quickly, my day job sent me to work out of our Milan office for a few months, so I was like, what will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar, and spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls with material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers.
And we found through this whole process, we found this great little manufacturer in Virginia, and if his body language is any indication, for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer, you've got to see what happens here.
But G.S. Industries was fantastic.
They actually built three prototypes for us by hand.
So now we have prototypes that can show that four people can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably than a tent could ever provide.
And they actually shipped them here to Texas for us.
Now, a funny thing started happening.
Other people started to believe in what we were doing, and actually offered us hangar space, donated hangar space to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed.
So now we had a hangar space to work in, and prototypes to demo with.
So in one year, we've negotiated manufacturing agreements, been awarded one patent, filed our second patent, talked to multiple people, demoed this to FEMA and its consultants to rave reviews, and then started talking to some other people who requested information, this little group called the United Nations.
And on top of that, now we have a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps, mobile youth hostels, right down to the World Cup and the Olympics.
So, in closing, on this whole thing here is hopefully very soon we will not have to respond to these painful phone calls that we get after disasters where we don't really have anything to sell or give you yet.
Hopefully very soon we will be there, because we are destined, obsessed with making it real.
Thank you.

<title>Michael McDaniel: Cheap, effective shelter for disaster relief</title>
<description>Michael McDaniel designed housing for disaster relief zones -- inexpensive, easy to transport, even beautiful – but found that no one was willing to build it. Persistent and obsessed, he decided to go it alone. At TEDxAustin, McDaniel show us his Exo Reaction Housing Solution and shares how he's dedicating his free time to working with suppliers and manufacturers to prepare for the next natural disaster. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

This is called Hooked on a Feeling: The Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design.
I put up a somewhat dour Darwin, but a very happy chimp up there.
My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory.
Man wishes to be happy, only wishes to be happy, and cannot wish not to be so.
We are wired to pursue happiness, not only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it.
So given that that's true, how good are we at increasing our happiness?
Well, we certainly try.
If you look on the Amazon site, there are over 2,000 titles with advice on the seven habits, the nine choices, the 10 secrets, the 14,000 thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness.
Now another way we try to increase our happiness is we medicate ourselves.
And so there's over 120 million prescriptions out there for antidepressants.
Prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug.
It was clean, efficient, there was no high, there was really no danger, it had no street value.
In 1995, illegal drugs were a $400 billion business, representing eight percent of world trade, roughly the same as gas and oil.
These routes to happiness haven't really increased happiness very much.
One problem that's happening now is, although the rates of happiness are about as flat as the surface of the moon, depression and anxiety are rising.
Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis, and more people are being found out.
It isn't just that. We're seeing it all over the world.
In the United States right now there are more suicides than homicides.
There is a rash of suicide in China.
And the World Health Organization predicts by the year 2020 that depression will be the second largest cause of disability.
Now the good news here is that if you take surveys from around the world, we see that about three quarters of people will say they are at least pretty happy.
But this does not follow any of the usual trends.
For example, these two show great growth in income, absolutely flat happiness curves.
My field, the field of psychology, hasn't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness.
In part, we have the legacy of Freud, who was a pessimist, who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest, is propelled by infantile aspects of the individual that can never be met in reality.
He said, "One feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be happy is not included in the plan of creation."
So the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy was really what Freud called ordinary misery.
And Freud in part reflects the anatomy of the human emotion system -- which is that we have both a positive and a negative system, and our negative system is extremely sensitive.
So for example, we're born loving the taste of something sweet and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter.
We also find that people are more averse to losing than they are happy to gain.
The formula for a happy marriage is five positive remarks, or interactions, for every one negative.
And that's how powerful the one negative is.
Especially expressions of contempt or disgust, well you really need a lot of positives to upset that.
I also put in here the stress response.
We're wired for dangers that are immediate, that are physical, that are imminent, and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where endogenous opioids come in.
We have a system that is really ancient, and really there for physical danger.
And so over time, this becomes a stress response, which has enormous effects on the body.
Cortisol floods the brain; it destroys hippocampal cells and memory, and can lead to all kinds of health problems.
But unfortunately, we need this system in part.
If we were only governed by pleasure we would not survive.
We really have two command posts.
Emotions are short-lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity.
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in, turn on, drop out thoughts, perceptions, feelings and memories.
We tend to think of emotions as just feelings.
But in fact, emotions are an all-systems alert that change what we remember, what kind of decisions we make, and how we perceive things.
So let me go forward to the new science of happiness.
We've come away from the Freudian gloom, and people are now actively studying this.
And one of the key points in the science of happiness is that happiness and unhappiness are not endpoints of a single continuum.
The Freudian model is really one continuum that, as you get less miserable, you get happier.
And that isn't true -- when you get less miserable, you get less miserable.
And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation.
And it's been missing. It's been missing from psychotherapy.
So when people's symptoms go away, they tend to recur, because there isn't a sense of the other half -- of what pleasure, happiness, compassion, gratitude, what are the positive emotions.
And of course we know this intuitively, that happiness is not just the absence of misery.
But somehow it was not put forward until very recently, seeing these as two parallel systems.
So that the body can both look for opportunity and also protect itself from danger, at the same time.
And they're sort of two reciprocal and dynamically interacting systems.
People have also wanted to deconstruct.
We use this word "happy," and it's this very large umbrella of a term.
And then three emotions for which there are no English words: fiero, which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge; schadenfreude, which is happiness in another's misfortune, a malicious pleasure; and naches, which is a pride and joy in one's children.
Absent from this list, and absent from any discussions of happiness, are happiness in another's happiness.
We don't seem to have a word for that.
We are very sensitive to the negative, but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity.
We're also born pleasure-seekers.
Babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter.
They love to touch smooth surfaces rather than rough ones.
They like to look at beautiful faces rather than plain faces.
They like to listen to consonant melodies instead of dissonant melodies.
Babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures.
There was once a statement made by a psychologist that said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happiness is really just about the genes, and it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller.
That's nonsense.
There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes -- about 50 percent -- but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for.
Let's just go into the brain for a moment, and see where does happiness arise from in evolution.
We have basically at least two systems here, and they both are very ancient.
One is the reward system, and that's fed by the chemical dopamine.
And it starts in the ventral tegmental area.
It goes to the nucleus accumbens, all the way up to the prefrontal cortex, orbital frontal cortex, where decisions are made, high level.
This was originally seen as a system that was the pleasure system of the brain.
In the 1950s, Olds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat.
And the rat would just keep pressing that bar thousands and thousands and thousands of times.
It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex.
It wouldn't do anything but press this bar.
So they assumed this must be, you know, the brain's orgasmatron.
It turned out that it wasn't, that it really is a system of motivation, a system of wanting.
It gives objects what's called incentive salience.
It makes something look so attractive that you just have to go after it.
That's something different from the system that is the pleasure system, which simply says, "I like this."
The pleasure system, as you see, which is the internal opiates, there is a hormone oxytocin, is widely spread throughout the brain.
Dopamine system, the wanting system, is much more centralized.
The other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal.
And we see here the smile.
And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips to the zygomatic major.
It's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye, the orbicularis oculi.
So you see, even 10-month-old babies, when they see their mother, will show this particular kind of smile.
Extroverts use it more than introverts.
People who are relieved of depression show it more after than before.
So if you want to unmask a true look of happiness, you will look for this expression.
Our pleasures are really ancient.
And we learn, of course, many, many pleasures, but many of them are base. And one of them, of course, is biophilia -- that we have a response to the natural world that's very profound.
Very interesting studies done on people recovering from surgery, who found that people who faced a brick wall versus people who looked out on trees and nature, the people who looked out on the brick wall were in the hospital longer, needed more medication, and had more medical complications.
There is something very restorative about nature, and it's part of how we are tuned.
Humans, particularly so, we're very imitative creatures.
And we imitate from almost the second we are born.
Here is a three-week-old baby.
And if you stick your tongue out at this baby, the baby will do the same.
We are social beings from the beginning.
And even studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain.
One problem that psychology has had is instead of looking at this intersubjectivity -- or the importance of the social brain to humans who come into the world helpless and need each other tremendously -- is that they focus instead on the self and self-esteem, and not self-other.
It's sort of "me," not "we."
And I think this has been a really tremendous problem that goes against our biology and nature, and hasn't made us any happier at all.
Because when you think about it, people are happiest when in flow, when they're absorbed in something out in the world, when they're with other people, when they're active, engaged in sports, focusing on a loved one, learning, having sex, whatever.
They're not sitting in front of the mirror trying to figure themselves out, or thinking about themselves.
These are not the periods when you feel happiest.
The other thing is, that a piece of evidence is, is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide, what you find there, and it's quite interesting, is use of the first person singular -- "I," "me," "my," not "we" and "us" -- and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone.
And being alone is very unnatural to the human.
There is a profound need to belong.
But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up.
Because, for example, the genes don't care whether we're happy, they care that we replicate, that we pass our genes on.
So for example we have three systems that underlie reproduction, because it's so important.
There's lust, which is just wanting to have sex.
And that's really mediated by the sex hormones.
Romantic attraction, that gets into the desire system.
And that's dopamine-fed. And that's, "I must have this one person."
There's attachment, which is oxytocin, and the opiates, which says, "This is a long-term bond."
See the problem is that, as humans, these three can separate.
So a person can be in a long term attachment, become romantically infatuated with someone else, and want to have sex with a third person.
The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray is in social status.
We are very acutely aware of our social status and always seek to further and increase it.
Now in the animal world, there is only one way to increase status, and that's dominance.
I seize command by physical prowess, and I keep it by beating my chest, and you make submissive gestures.
Now, the human has a whole other way to rise to the top, and that is a prestige route, which is freely conferred.
Someone has expertise and knowledge, and knows how to do things, and we give that person status.
And that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status so that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy as they are in the animal world.
The data isn't terribly supportive of money buying happiness.
But it's not irrelevant.
So if you look at questions like this, life satisfaction, you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income.
You see mental distress going up with lower income.
So clearly there is some effect.
But the effect is relatively small.
And one of the problems with money is materialism.
What happens when people pursue money too avidly, is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life.
So we have here, this couple.
"Do you think the less-fortunate are having better sex?"
And then this kid over here is saying, "Leave me alone with my toys."
So one of the things is that it really takes over.
That whole dopamine-wanting system takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system.
Maslow had this idea back in the 1950s that as people rise above their biological needs, as the world becomes safer and we don't have to worry about basic needs being met -- our biological system, whatever motivates us, is being satisfied -- we can rise above them, to think beyond ourselves toward self-actualization or transcendence, and rise above the materialist.
So to just quickly conclude with some brief data that suggests this might be so.
One is people who underwent what is called a quantum change: they felt their life and their whole values had changed.
And sure enough, if you look at the kinds of values that come in, you see wealth, adventure, achievement, pleasure, fun, be respected, before the change, and much more post-materialist values after.
Women had a whole different set of value shifts.
But very similarly, the only one that survived there was happiness.
They went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control to generosity and forgiveness.
I end with a few quotes.
"There is only one question: How to love this world?"
And Rilke, "If your daily life seems poor, do not blame it; blame yourself.
Tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches."
"First, say to yourself what you would be.
Then do what you have to do."
Thank you.

<title>Nancy Etcoff: Happiness and its surprises</title>
<description>Cognitive researcher Nancy Etcoff looks at happiness -- the ways we try to achieve and increase it, the way it's untethered to our real circumstances, and its surprising effect on our bodies.</description>

Imagine if you could record your life -- everything you said, everything you did, available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips, so you could go back and find memorable moments and relive them, or sift through traces of time and discover patterns in your own life that previously had gone undiscovered.
Well that's exactly the journey that my family began five and a half years ago.
This is my wife and collaborator, Rupal.
And on this day, at this moment, we walked into the house with our first child, our beautiful baby boy.
And we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system.
Okay.
Deb Roy: This moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house, if you looked up, you'd see a camera and a microphone, and if you looked down, you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room.
Here's our living room, the baby bedroom, kitchen, dining room and the rest of the house.
And all of these fed into a disc array that was designed for a continuous capture.
So here we are flying through a day in our home as we move from sunlit morning through incandescent evening and, finally, lights out for the day.
Over the course of three years, we recorded eight to 10 hours a day, amassing roughly a quarter-million hours of multi-track audio and video.
So you're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made.
And what this data represents for our family at a personal level, the impact has already been immense, and we're still learning its value.
Countless moments of unsolicited natural moments, not posed moments, are captured there, and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them.
But there's also a scientific reason that drove this project, which was to use this natural longitudinal data to understand the process of how a child learns language -- that child being my son.
And so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data, we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at MIT so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set, trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition.
So we're looking here at one of the first things we started to do.
This is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen, and as we move through space and through time, a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen.
In order to convert this opaque, 90,000 hours of video into something that we could start to see, we use motion analysis to pull out, as we move through space and through time, what we call space-time worms.
And this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data, and with it, trace the pattern of, in particular, where my son moved throughout the home, so that we could focus our transcription efforts, all of the speech environment around my son -- all of the words that he heard from myself, my wife, our nanny, and over time, the words he began to produce.
So with that technology and that data and the ability to, with machine assistance, transcribe speech, we've now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts.
And with that, let me take you now for a first tour into the data.
So you've all, I'm sure, seen time-lapse videos where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time.
I'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form.
My son, soon after his first birthday, would say "gaga" to mean water.
And over the course of the next half-year, he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form, "water."
So we're going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds.
No video here, so you can focus on the sound, the acoustics, of a new kind of trajectory: gaga to water.
Baby: Gagagagagaga Gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water.
DR: He sure nailed it, didn't he.
So he didn't just learn water.
Over the course of the 24 months, the first two years that we really focused on, this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order.
And because we have full transcripts, we've identified each of the 503 words that he learned to produce by his second birthday.
He was an early talker.
And so we started to analyze why.
Why were certain words born before others?
This is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us.
The way to interpret this apparently simple graph is, on the vertical is an indication of how complex caregiver utterances are based on the length of utterances.
And the [horizontal] axis is time.
And all of the data, we aligned based on the following idea: Every time my son would learn a word, we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word.
And we would plot the relative length of the utterances.
And what we found was this curious phenomena, that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum, making language as simple as possible, and then slowly ascend back up in complexity.
And the amazing thing was that bounce, that dip, lined up almost precisely with when each word was born -- word after word, systematically.
So it appears that all three primary caregivers -- myself, my wife and our nanny -- were systematically and, I would think, subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language.
And the implications of this -- there are many, but one I just want to point out, is that there must be amazing feedback loops.
Of course, my son is learning from his linguistic environment, but the environment is learning from him.
That environment, people, are in these tight feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding that has not been noticed until now.
But that's looking at the speech context.
What about the visual context?
We're not looking at -- think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house.
We've taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras, and we've done some optical correction, and then we can bring it into three-dimensional life.
So welcome to my home.
This is a moment, one moment captured across multiple cameras.
The reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine, where you can go back and interactively fly around and then breathe video-life into this system.
What I'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes, again, of just life in the living room.
That's me and my son on the floor.
And there's video analytics that are tracking our movements.
My son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink.
We're now on the couch, looking out through the window at cars passing by.
And finally, my son playing in a walking toy by himself.
Now we freeze the action, 30 minutes, we turn time into the vertical axis, and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we've just left behind.
And we see these amazing structures -- these little knots of two colors of thread we call "social hot spots."
The spiral thread we call a "solo hot spot."
And we think that these affect the way language is learned.
What we'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they're learned -- so in other words, the relationship between words and what they're about in the world.
So here's how we're approaching this.
In this video, again, my son is being traced out.
He's leaving red ink behind.
And there's our nanny by the door.
Nanny: You want water?
Nanny: All right.
DR: She offers water, and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water.
And what we've done is use the word "water" to tag that moment, that bit of activity.
And now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in, and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that co-occurred with an instance of water.
And what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape.
We call these wordscapes.
This is the wordscape for the word water, and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen.
That's where those big peaks are over to the left.
And just for contrast, we can do this with any word.
We can take the word "bye" as in "good bye."
And we're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house.
And we look, and we find, as you would expect, a contrast in the landscape where the word "bye" occurs much more in a structured way.
So we're using these structures to start predicting the order of language acquisition, and that's ongoing work now.
In my lab, which we're peering into now, at MIT -- this is at the media lab.
This has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space.
Three of the key people in this project, Philip DeCamp, Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here.
Philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you're seeing.
And Michael Fleischman was another Ph.D. student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis, and he made the following observation: that "just the way that we're analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language, that same idea we can take out of your home, Deb, and we can apply it to the world of public media."
And so our effort took an unexpected turn.
Think of mass media as providing common ground and you have the recipe for taking this idea to a whole new place.
We've started analyzing television content using the same principles -- analyzing event structure of a TV signal -- episodes of shows, commercials, all of the components that make up the event structure.
And we're now, with satellite dishes, pulling and analyzing a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States.
And you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones to get people's conversations, you just tune into publicly available social media feeds.
So we're pulling in about three billion comments a month, and then the magic happens.
You have the event structure, the common ground that the words are about, coming out of the television feeds; you've got the conversations that are about those topics; and through semantic analysis -- and this is actually real data you're looking at from our data processing -- each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal.
And the same idea now can be built up.
And we get this wordscape, except now words are not assembled in my living room.
Instead, the context, the common ground activities, are the content on television that's driving the conversations.
And what we're seeing here, these skyscrapers now, are commentary that are linked to content on television.
Same concept, but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere.
And so fundamentally, rather than, for example, measuring content based on how many people are watching, this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content.
And just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family, we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people.
This is a subset of data from our database -- just 50,000 out of several million -- and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources.
And if you put them on one plain, a second plain is where the content lives.
So we have the programs and the sporting events and the commercials, and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph.
And then the important third dimension.
Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content.
And there are, again, now tens of millions of these links that give us the connective tissue of social graphs and how they relate to content.
And we can now start to probe the structure in interesting ways.
So if we, for example, trace the path of one piece of content that drives someone to comment on it, and then we follow where that comment goes, and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated and then trace back to see the relationship between that social graph and content, a very interesting structure becomes visible.
We call this a co-viewing clique, a virtual living room if you will.
And there are fascinating dynamics at play.
It's not one way.
A piece of content, an event, causes someone to talk.
They talk to other people.
That drives tune-in behavior back into mass media, and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior.
Another example -- very different -- another actual person in our database -- and we're finding at least hundreds, if not thousands, of these.
We've given this person a name.
This is a pro-amateur, or pro-am media critic who has this high fan-out rate.
So a lot of people are following this person -- very influential -- and they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV.
So this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together.
One last example from this data: Sometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special.
So if we go and look at this piece of content, President Obama's State of the Union address from just a few weeks ago, and look at what we find in this same data set, at the same scale, the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable.
A nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what's on the broadcast.
And of course, through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language.
We can X-ray and get a real-time pulse of a nation, real-time sense of the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph being activated by content.
So, to summarize, the idea is this: As our world becomes increasingly instrumented and we have the capabilities to collect and connect the dots between what people are saying and the context they're saying it in, what's emerging is an ability to see new social structures and dynamics that have previously not been seen.
It's like building a microscope or telescope and revealing new structures about our own behavior around communication.
And I think the implications here are profound, whether it's for science, for commerce, for government, or perhaps most of all, for us as individuals.
And so just to return to my son, when I was preparing this talk, he was looking over my shoulder, and I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today, and I asked him for permission -- granted.
And then I went on to reflect, "Isn't it amazing, this entire database, all these recordings, I'm going to hand off to you and to your sister" -- who arrived two years later -- "and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments that you could never, with your biological memory, possibly remember the way you can now?"
And he was quiet for a moment.
And I thought, "What am I thinking?
He's five years old. He's not going to understand this."
And just as I was having that thought, he looked up at me and said, "So that when I grow up, I can show this to my kids?"
And I thought, "Wow, this is powerful stuff."
So I want to leave you with one last memorable moment from our family.
This is the first time our son took more than two steps at once -- captured on film.
And I really want you to focus on something as I take you through.
It's a cluttered environment; it's natural life.
My mother's in the kitchen, cooking, and, of all places, in the hallway, I realize he's about to do it, about to take more than two steps.
And so you hear me encouraging him, realizing what's happening, and then the magic happens.
Listen very carefully.
About three steps in, he realizes something magic is happening, and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in, and he whispers "wow" and instinctively I echo back the same.
And so let's fly back in time to that memorable moment.
DR: Hey.
Come here.
Can you do it?
Oh, boy.
Can you do it?
Baby: Yeah.
DR: Ma, he's walking.
DR: Thank you.

<title>Deb Roy: The birth of a word</title>
<description>MIT researcher Deb Roy wanted to understand how his infant son learned language -- so he wired up his house with videocameras to catch every moment of his son's life, then parsed 90,000 hours of home video to watch "gaaaa" slowly turn into "water." Astonishing, data-rich research with deep implications for how we learn.</description>

I was sitting with my girls, and Joy said, "Dang, I wish he'd get off my back.
My daddy, he calls me all the time."
"Lucky for you he calls at all," said Jasmine.
"I haven't heard from my dad in years."
At this moment, I knew the girls needed a way to connect with their fathers.
At Camp Diva, my non-profit organization, we have these types of conversations all the time as a way to help girls of African descent prepare for their passage into womanhood.
These girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms.
So I asked the girls, "How can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers?"
"Let's have a dance," one girl shouted, and all the girls quickly backed her up.
They started dreaming about the decorations, invitations, the dresses they were going to wear, and what their fathers could and could not wear.
It was off and running before I could even blink my eyes, but even if I could have slowed down those girls, I wouldn't have, because one thing that I have learned from over a decade of working with girls is that they already know what they need.
The wisdom lives inside of them.
As long as they have infrastructure, mentorship and resources, they can build what they need, not only to survive, but to thrive.
So we had a dance, and girls and their fathers came in multitudes.
They were dressed to the nines.
They acted sweet.
They acted silly.
They really enjoyed each other's company.
It was a huge success.
And the girls decided to make it an annual event.
So as the seasons changed, and it was time to plan the dance again, one girl named Brianna spoke up, and she said, "My dad can't come to the dance, and this whole thing is making me sad."
"Why not?" the girls asked.
"Because he's in jail," she bravely admitted.
"Well, can he just get out for a day?" one of the girls asked.
"And come in shackles?
That's worse than not having him here at all."
At this moment, I saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes.
So I asked, "What do you think we should do about this?
We want every girl to experience the dance, right?"
So the girls thought for a moment, and one girl suggested, "Why don't we just take the dance in the jail?"
Most of the girls doubted the possibility of that, and said, "Are you crazy?
Who is going to allow a bunch of little girls, dressed up — " " — to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits?"
Because that's what they called them.
I said, "Girls, well, well, you never know unless you ask."
So a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff, signed collectively by each girl, and I would have to say, he is a very special sheriff.
He contacted me immediately and said, whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside, his doors are always open.
Because one thing he did know, that when fathers are connected to their children, it is less likely that they will return.
So, 16 inmates and 18 girls were invited.
The girls were dressed in their Sunday best, and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits for shirts and ties.
They hugged.
They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish.
They laughed together.
It was beautiful.
The fathers and daughters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection, something that a lot of them didn't even have for a while.
Fathers were in a space where they were able to make their daughters play, and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance.
Even the guards cried.
But after the dance, we all realized that Dad still would be in jail.
So we needed to create something that they could take with them.
So we brought in Flip cams, and we had them look at the Flip cams and just interview each other -- their messages, their thoughts.
This was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected, they could reconnect through this image.
I'll never forget that one girl looked in her father's eyes with that camera and said, "Daddy, when you look at me, what do you see?"
Because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve, and how they see us for the rest of our lives.
I know that very well, because I was one of the lucky girls.
I have had my father in my life always.
He's even here today.
And that is why it is extremely special for me to make sure that these girls are connected to their fathers, especially those who are separated because of barbed wires and metal doors.
We have just created a form for girls who have heavy questions on their heart to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions and given the fathers the freedom to answer.
Because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought: What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world?
Because a father is locked in does not mean he should be locked out of his daughter's life.

<title>Angela Patton: A father-daughter dance ... in prison</title>
<description>At Camp Diva, Angela Patton works to help girls and fathers stay connected and in each others' lives. But what about girls whose fathers can't be there -- because they're in jail? Patton tells the story of a very special father-daughter dance. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

Beverly Joubert: We are truly passionate about the African wilderness and protecting the African wilderness, and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats.
And I know, in the light of human suffering and poverty and even climate change, one would wonder, why worry about a few cats?
Well today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character -- this leopard.
Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been like a super long episode of "CSI" -- something like 28 years.
In essence, what we've done is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior, we've seen over 2,000 kills by these amazing animals.
But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality, that individual personality that these animals have.
And here's a prime example.
We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old baobab tree in Africa, the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother.
And she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us -- her own daughter, eight days old.
And the minute we found this leopard, we realized that we needed to move in, and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four-and-a-half years -- following her every day, getting to know her, that individual personality of hers, and really coming to know her.
Now I'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique, very, very special, individualistic and often seductive female characters.
Beverly's clearly one of them, and this little leopard, Legadema, is another, and she changed our lives.
BJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her -- in fact, more time than even her mother did.
When her mother would go off hunting, we would stay and film.
And early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree 20 paces away from us.
It was frightening, and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell.
And of course, we were stunned for a while, but when we managed to get our wits about us, we looked at it and said, "My gosh, what's going to happen with that little cub?
She's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us."
Well, we needn't have worried.
She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us, sat next to us, shivering, with her back towards Dereck, and looking out.
And actually from that day on, she's been comfortable with us.
So we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name.
We called her Legadema, which means, "light from the sky."
DJ: Now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals, in particular in the cats.
This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh, "he who greets with fire," and you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character.
But only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have.
BJ: But through our investigation, we have to seek the wildest places in Africa.
And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana.
Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent, but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.
But also, our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time, because we're driving through water, and it's an unknown territory.
But we're really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.
DJ: Now one of the big things, of course, everybody knows that cats hate water, and so this was a real revelation for us.
And we could only find this by pushing ourselves, by going where no sane person should go -- not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly -- and just pushing the envelope, going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves.
But we've managed to find that these lions are 15 percent bigger than any others, and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.
BJ: And then of course, the challenge is knowing when to turn around.
We don't always get that right, and on this particular day, we seriously underestimated the depth.
We got deeper and deeper, until it was at Dereck's chest-height.
Well then we hit a deep depression, and we seriously submerged the vehicle.
We actually managed to drown two million dollars' worth of camera gear.
We drowned our pride, I must tell you, which was really serious, and we seized the engine.
DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles.
You will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by Beverly -- the dry top angle, by the way.
But all the places we get stuck in really have great views.
And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us, and Beverly was able to get a great photograph.
BJ: But we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage.
And 20 years ago, we did a film called "Eternal Enemies" where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species -- lions and hyenas.
And surprisingly, it became a cult film.
And we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and gang warfare.
DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name, Eetwidomayloh, represents.
He's focused on this hyena, and he is going to get it.
But that's, I think, what this is all about, is that these individuals have these personalities and characters.
But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves, but we live by certain rules of engagement, which mean we can't interfere.
This sort of behavior has been going on for three, four, five million years, and we can't step in and say, "That's wrong, and that's right."
But that's not always easy for us.
BJ: So, as Dereck says, we have to work through extremes -- extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night.
Sleep deprivation is extreme.
We're on the edge through a large part of the time.
But, for 10 years, we tried to capture lions and elephants together -- and never ever managed until this particular night.
And I have to tell you that it was a disturbing night for me.
I had tears rolling down my cheeks.
I was shaking with anxiety, but I knew that [I had] to capture something that had never been seen before, had never been documented.
And I do believe you should stay with us.
DJ: The amazing thing about these moments -- and this is probably a highlight of our career -- is that you never know how it's going to end.
Many people believe, in fact, that death begins in the eyes, not in the heart, not in the lungs, and that's when people give up hope, or when any life form gives up hope.
And you can see the start of it here.
This elephant, against overwhelming odds, simply gives up hope.
But by the same token, you can get your hope back again.
So just when you think it's all over, something else happens, some spark gets into you, some sort of will to fight -- that iron will that we all have, that this elephant has, that conservation has, that big cats have.
Everything has that will to survive, to fight, to push through that mental barrier and to keep going.
And for us, in many ways, this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us, a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.
Now back to the leopard.
We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism, her personal character, that maybe we were taking it a little bit far.
We were perhaps taking her for granted, and maybe she didn't like that that much.
This is about couples working together, and so I do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.
Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is, and I'm on the other side where my space is.
These are precious to us, these divides.
BJ: But when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear, she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate.
It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent.
But at the same time, we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car, it might not turn out the same way -- she might get shot for that.
So we knew we had to react quickly.
And the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make -- a hiss and a sound.
So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car -- very innovative.
DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage, because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.
But really and truly, this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality.
But nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her, when she started hunting.
BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited.
It was like watching a graduation ceremony.
We felt like we were surrogate parents.
And of course, we knew now that she was going to survive.
But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with Legadema.
And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent, it didn't turn and run.
So what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique.
It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety, protecting it from the hyena.
And over the next five hours, she took care of it.
We realized that we actually don't know everything, and that nature is so unpredictable, we have to be open at all times.
DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough.
But in fact, what we were seeing here was interesting.
Because she is a cub wanting to play, but she was also a predator needing to kill, and yet conflicted in some way, because she was also an emerging mother.
She had this maternal instinct, much like a young girl on her way to womanhood, and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality.
BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together.
They ended up sleeping for hours.
But I have to tell you -- everybody always asks, "What happened to the baby baboon?"
It did die, and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.
DJ: So at this stage, I guess, we had very, very firm ideas on what conservation meant.
We had to deal with these individual personalities.
We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them.
And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative to march forward into conservation, taking care of the big cats that we loved -- and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years to see how well we had all collectively been doing.
So when Beverly and I were born, there were 450,000 lions, and today there are 20,000.
Tigers haven't fared any better -- 45,000 down to maybe 3,000.
BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000.
Leopards have plummeted from 700,000 down to a mere 50,000.
Now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with Legadema -- which is really over a five-year period -- 10,000 leopards were legally shot by safari hunters.
And that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period.
There's an immense amount of poaching as well, and so possibly the same amount.
It's simply not sustainable.
We admire them, and we fear them, and yet, as man, we want to steal their power.
It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin, but now throughout rituals and ceremonies, traditional healers and ministers.
And of course, looking at this lion paw that has been skinned, it eerily reminds me of a human hand, and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.
DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.
Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same, and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers.
So we have a real problem here, no more so than the lions do, the male lions.
So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring, because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions, and they all are actually infected with the same disease.
I call it complacency -- our complacency.
Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on that we're all aware of, that we condone.
And that's probably because we haven't seen it like we are today.
BJ: And you have to know that, when a male lion is killed, it completely disrupts the whole pride.
A new male comes into the area and takes over the pride, and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.
So we've estimated that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far-off place.
DJ: So what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential.
They're essential to the habitat.
If they disappear, whole ecosystems in Africa disappear.
There's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year ecotourism revenue stream into Africa.
So this is not just a concern about lions; it's a concern about communities in Africa as well.
If they disappear, all of that goes away.
But what I'm more concerned about in many ways is that, as we de-link ourselves from nature, as we de-link ourselves spiritually from these animals, we lose hope, we lose that spiritual connection, our dignity, that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet.
BJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now, it is all about critical awareness.
And so what we are doing, in February, we're bringing out a film called "The Last Lion," and "The Last Lion" is exactly what is happening right now.
That is the situation we're in -- the last lions.
That is, if we don't take action and do something, these plains will be completely devoid of big cats, and then, in turn, everything else will disappear.
And simply, if we can't protect them, we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.
DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by -- that conservation was all about respect and celebration -- is probably true. That's really what it needs.
We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman, as a community and as part of this planet, and we need to continue that.
And Legadema?
Well we can report, in fact, that we're grandparents.
BJ/DJ: Thank you very much.

There are more Chinese restaurants in this country than McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's, combined -- 40,000, actually.
Chinese restaurants have played an important role in American history, as a matter of fact.
The Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant called Yenching Palace in Washington, D.C., which unfortunately is closed now, and about to be turned into Walgreen's.
And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok 'n Roll, on H Street in Washington.
And it's not completely gratuitous, because wok and roll -- Chinese food and Japanese foods, so it kind of works out.
And Americans love their Chinese food so much they've actually brought it into space.
NASA, for example, serves thermal-stabilized sweet-and-sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts.
So, let me present the question to you: If our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie, you should ask yourself, how often do you eat apple pie, versus how often do you eat Chinese food. Right?
And if you think about it, a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or Americans think of as Chinese food are barely recognizable to Chinese, for example: beef with broccoli, egg rolls, General Tso's Chicken, fortune cookies, chop suey, the take-out boxes.
For example, I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China, gave them to Chinese to see how they would react.
What is this?
Should I try it?
Try it!
What is it called?
Fortune cookie.
There's a piece of paper inside!
What is this?
You've won a prize!
What is this?
It's a fortune!
Tasty!
So, where are they from?
The short answer is, actually, they're from Japan.
And in Kyoto, outside, there are still small family-run bakeries that make fortune cookies, as they did over 100 years ago, 30 years before fortune cookies were introduced in the United States.
If you see them side by side, there's yellow and brown.
Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste, so they're not as sweet as our version.
So, how did they get to the United States?
Well, the short answer is, the Japanese immigrants came over, and a bunch of the bakers introduced them -- including at least one in Los Angeles, and one here in San Francisco called Benkyo-do, which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan.
They back then, actually, made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in Kyoto.
So, the interesting question is, how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese to being something that is Chinese?
Well, the short answer is, we locked up all the Japanese during World War II, including those that made fortune cookies, so that's the time when the Chinese moved in, kind of saw a market opportunity and took over.
So, fortune cookies: invented by the Japanese, popularized by the Chinese, but ultimately consumed by Americans.
They are more American than anything else.
Another one of my favorite dishes: General Tso's Chicken -- which, by the way, in the US Naval Academy is called Admiral Tso's Chicken.
I love this dish.
The original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso, and he has marched very far indeed, because he is sweet, he is fried, and he is chicken -- all things that Americans love.
He has marched so far, actually, that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn't recognize it; he's kind of horrified.
He's in Taiwan right now.
He's retired, deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong.
So, he -- after this I showed him, he got up, and he's like, "Mominqimiao," which means, "This is all nonsense," and goes back to play his Mahjong game during the afternoon.
So, another dish. One of my favorites. Beef with broccoli.
Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable; in fact, it is originally an Italian vegetable.
It was introduced into the United States in the 1800s, but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s.
In fact, the Chinese had their own version of broccoli, which is called Chinese broccoli, but right now, what -- they've now discovered American broccoli, and are importing it as a, sort of, exotic delicacy.
I guarantee you, General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life -- and indeed, that actually was a picture of General Tso.
I went to his home town.
This is a billboard that says: "Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso."
And I went looking for chicken.
Finally found a cow -- and did find chicken.
Believe it or not, these guys were actually crossing the road.
And -- -- I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who are still in the little town.
This guy is now five generations removed from the General; this guy is about seven.
Showed them all the pictures of General Tso Chicken that I showed you, and they're like, we don't know this dish.
And then they're like, is this Chinese food?
Because it doesn't look like Chinese food to them.
But they weren't kind of surprised I traveled around the world to visit them, because in their eyes he is, after all, a famous Qing dynasty military hero.
He played an important role in the Taiping rebellion, which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of God and the baby brother of Jesus Christ.
And caused the war that killed 20 million people -- still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day.
So, you know, I realized when I was there, General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America, in that he's known for chicken and not war.
But in China, this guy's actually known for war and not chicken.
But the granddaddy of all the Chinese-American dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey, which was introduced around the turn of the 20th century.
And according to New York Times, in 1904, there was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town, and "the city has gone 'chop suey' mad."
So it took about 30 years before the Americans realized that, whoa, chop suey is actually not known in China.
And as this article points out, "The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey."
You know, back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan: if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl, you could take her out on a chop suey date.
I like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another, because chop suey, if you translate into Chinese, means tsap sui, which, if you translate back, means "odds and ends."
So, these people are going around China asking for chop suey, which is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying, I understand you have a very popular dish in your country called "leftovers," and it is particularly -- -- right?
And not only that: this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call Thanksgiving.
So, why -- why and where -- did chop suey come from?
Let's go back to mid-1800s when the Chinese first came to America.
Now back then, the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food.
In fact, they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien.
These people weren't eating dogs -- they were eating cats -- and they weren't eating cats -- they were eating rats.
In fact, The New York Times, my esteemed employer, in 1883 ran an article that asked, "Do Chinese eat rats?"
And not the most PC question to be asked today, but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time, not so outlandish.
This is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late 1800s, and if you see, under the word "Clears" -- very small -- it says, "They must go," which refers not only to the rats, but to the Chinese in their midst, because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us.
And another way that you saw, sort of, this sort of, this antipathy towards the Chinese is through documents like this.
This is actually in the Library of Congress; it is a pamphlet published by Samuel Gompers, hero of our American labor movement, and it's called, "Some Reason for Chinese Exclusion: Meat versus Rice: American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism: Which shall survive?
And it basically made the argument that Chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for American men who ate meat.
this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country So, with sentiments like these, the Chinese Exclusion Act was sort of passed between 1882 and 1902, the only time in American history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity.
So, in a way, because the Chinese were attacked, chop suey was created as a defense mechanism.
Now, who came up with the idea of chop suey?
There's a lot of different mysteries, a lot of different legends, but of the ones that I've found that I thought was most interesting is this article from 1904.
A Chinese guy named Lem Sen shows up in Chinatown, New York City, and says, I want you guys all to stop making chop suey, because I am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey.
And the way that he tells it, there was a guy, there was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up, and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.
And as he said -- we would never print this today -- but basically, the American man has become very rich.
Lem Sen, who's this guy: I would have made this money, too, but I've spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe.
Now I've come and found him, and I want my recipe back and I want everyone to stop making chop suey, or pay me for the right to do the same.
So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights.
So the thing is, this kind of idea of Chinese-American food doesn't exist only in America.
In fact, if you think about it, Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet, served on all seven continents, even Antarctica, because Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station, which is the main scientific station in Antarctica.
So, you see different varieties of Chinese food.
For example, there is French Chinese food, where they serve salt and pepper frog legs.
There is Italian Chinese food, where they don't have fortune cookies, so they serve fried gelato.
My downstairs neighbor, Alessandra, was completely shocked when I told her, "Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."
She's like, "It's not?
But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy."
And even the Brits have their own version.
This is a dish called crispy shredded beef, which has a lot of crisp, a lot of shred, and not a lot of beef.
There is West Indian Chinese food, there's Jamaican Chinese food, there is Middle Eastern Chinese food, there's Mauritian Chinese food.
This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered.
There's Indian Chinese food, Korean Chinese food, Japanese Chinese food, where they take the bao, the little buns, and they make them into pizza versions, and they take -- and they -- like, totally randomly they'll take Chinese noodle dishes, and they'll just Ramen-ize them.
This is, like, this is something that in the Chinese version has no soup.
So, there's Peruvian Chinese food, which should not be mixed with Mexican Chinese food, where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas.
And then -- one thing: they have things like risotto chop suey.
My personal favorite of all the restaurants I've encountered around the world was this one in Brazil, called "Kung Food."
So, let's take a step back, and kind of, understand what is to be appreciated in America.
McDonald's has, sort of, garnered a lot of attention, a lot of respect, for basically standardizing the menu, décor and dining experience in post-World War II America.
But you know what?
They actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois, right?
Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing, I would argue, with the menu and the décor -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters.
So, this actually became very clear to me with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing, where, you know, they expected, based on the number of ticket sales they had, to have three or four second-place winners -- those are the people who match five or six Powerball numbers.
Instead, they had 110, and they were completely shocked.
They looked all across the country, and discovered it couldn't necessarily be fraud, because it happened, you know, in different states, across different computer systems.
So whatever it was, it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way.
So, like, OK, maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know, like, it was a diamond, or, you know, diagonal.
It wasn't that.
It wasn't that, so they're like, OK, let's look at television, so they looked at an episode of "Lost."
Now, I don't have a TV, which makes me a freak, but very productive, and -- -- and this episode of "Lost," I understand, where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number, which was how long they'd been on the island, but they looked, and the numbers did not match.
So they looked at "The Young and The Restless," and it wasn't that, either.
So, it wasn't until the first guy shows up the next day, and they ask him, "Where did you get your number from?"
He's like, "Oh, I got it from a fortune cookie."
This actually is a slip that one of the winners had, because the Tennessee lottery security officials were like, oh, no -- like, this can't be true.
But it was true, and basically, of those 110 people, and 104 of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie.
Yeah. So, I went and started looking.
I went across the country, looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from.
You know, there are a bunch of them, including Lee's China in Omaha -- which is actually run by Koreans, but that's another point -- and a bunch of them named China Buffet.
So, what's interesting is that their stories were similar, but they were different.
It was lunch, it was take-out, it was sit-down, it was buffet, it was three weeks ago, it was three months ago.
But at some point, all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a Chinese restaurant, and all these Chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies, which, of course we know aren't even Chinese to begin with.
So it's kind of part of the phenomenon I called spontaneous self-organization, right, where, like in ant colonies, where little decisions made by -- on the micro-level actually have a big impact on the macro-level.
So, a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets.
McDonald's actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product.
They did chicken pot pie, they did fried chicken, and then they finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.
And the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggetfying them, because that's kind of an easy concept, but the trick behind Chicken McNuggets was, they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-effective manner, which is why it took so long for other people to copy them.
It took 10 years, and then within a couple of months, it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of McDonald's in the country.
In contrast, we have General Tso's Chicken, which actually started in New York City in the early 1970s, as I was also starting in the university in New York City in the early 1970s, so ...
And this logo!
So me, General Tso's Chicken and this logo are all karmacally related.
But that dish also took about 10 years to spread across America from a random restaurant in New York City.
Someone's like, oh, God -- it's sweet, it's fried, it's chicken: Americans will love this.
So, what I like to say, you know, this being sort of Bay Area, Silicon Valley -- is that we think of McDonald's as sort of the Microsoft of the dining experiences.
We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux: sort of an open source thing, right, where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system, that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food, you know, depending on the region.
For example, you know, in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food, where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish, right?
And in Philadelphia, you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll, which looks like an egg roll on the outside, but a cheesesteak on the inside.
I was really surprised to discover that, not only in Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta, because what had happened was that a Chinese family had moved from Atlanta to -- sorry, from Philadelphia to Atlanta, and brought that with them.
So, the thing is, our historical lore, because of the way we like narratives, are full of vast characters such as, you know, Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Ray Kroc with McDonald's and Asa Chandler with Coca-Cola.
But, you know, it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters -- oops -- for example, like Lem Sen, who introduced chop suey, Chef Peng, who introduced General Tso Chicken, and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies.
So, the point of my presentation is to make you think twice, that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much, if not more, impact on what we eat today.
So. Thank you very much.

Some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields.
So tonight I'd like to tell you about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment, which is entertainment and robotics.
So if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society, maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the dramatic arts.
I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts and to attract people to science and technology.
Some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology.
With my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot, I would like to use art to create tech.
So we're based in New York City.
And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate with an adorable robot, or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation, please contact me, the Bot-Agent.
The bot, our rising celebrity, also has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild.
I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data.
He's named after the Star Trek character.
I think he's going to be super popular.
We've got the robot -- in his head is a database of a lot of jokes.
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.
So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.
It knows how much it's moving.
And so it's going to try to watch your response.
I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.
It can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style, over longer-term to different communities or audiences, children versus adults, different cultures.
You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in.
And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions.
Some of you in this middle section -- you have red/green paddles.
If you like what's going on, show the green.
If you don't like the subject or the performance, you can hold the red.
Now don't be shy.
It's just a robot.
It doesn't have feelings ... yet.
And the rest of you, you still count, you still matter.
There's also a microphone that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause and booing -- I hope not -- to help make some of its next decisions.
Right, so, let the robot stand-up comedy begin.
Data: Hello TEDWomen.
It's an honor to be here.
You guys are looking good out there.
Ready for some jokes?
Data: Here's the first one.
Right, so, a doctor says to his patient, "I have bad news and worse news.
The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live."
"That's terrible," said the patient.
"How can the news possibly be worse?"
"I've been trying to contact you since yesterday."
The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war.
Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss.
Data: Pretty lucky for them.
Ever see that little Swiss Army knife they have to fight with?
"Come on buddy, I have the toe clippers right here.
You get past me, the guy behind me has a spoon."
HK: He's a French robot.
Data: A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods.
One of them falls to the ground.
He does not seem to be breathing.
The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911.
He gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead.
What can I do?"
The operator says, "Just take it easy.
I can help.
First, let's make sure he's dead."
There is a silence, and the operator hears a shot.
The guy's voice comes back on the line, "Okay, now what?"
Question: Why is television called a medium?
Anyone?
Because it's neither rare nor well done.
But to be completely honest with you, I kind of love television.
Any of you like television? Audience: Yes.
Data: I find it incredibly educational.
Actually, as soon as someone turns it on, I go into the other room and read.
That's all for now.
Was that okay for my first time?
You've been a great audience.
Thank you.
HK: Yay.
So this is actually the first time we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance.
So thank you all for being a part of it.
There's a lot more to come.
And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression.
Thank you very much.

"Don't talk to strangers."
You have heard that phrase uttered by your friends, family, schools and the media for decades.
It's a norm. It's a social norm.
But it's a special kind of social norm, because it's a social norm that wants to tell us who we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to.
"Don't talk to strangers" says, "Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you.
Stick with the people you know.
Stick with people like you."
How appealing is that?
It's not really what we do, is it, when we're at our best?
When we're at our best, we reach out to people who are not like us, because when we do that, we learn from people who are not like us.
My phrase for this value of being with "not like us" is "strangeness," and my point is that in today's digitally intensive world, strangers are quite frankly not the point.
The point that we should be worried about is, how much strangeness are we getting?
Why strangeness? Because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data, and data turns our social relations into digital relations, and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness, a sense of discovery, a sense of surprise and unpredictability.
Why not strangers?
Because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries.
They belong to a world of people I know versus people I don't know, and in the context of my digital relations, I'm already doing things with people I don't know.
The question isn't whether or not I know you.
The question is, what can I do with you?
What can I learn with you?
What can we do together that benefits us both?
I spend a lot of time thinking about how the social landscape is changing, how new technologies create new constraints and new opportunities for people.
The most important changes facing us today have to do with data and what data is doing to shape the kinds of digital relations that will be possible for us in the future.
The economies of the future depend on that.
Our social lives in the future depend on that.
The threat to worry about isn't strangers.
The threat to worry about is whether or not we're getting our fair share of strangeness.
Now, 20th-century psychologists and sociologists were thinking about strangers, but they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations, and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices.
Stanley Milgram from the '60s and '70s, the creator of the small-world experiments, which became later popularized as six degrees of separation, made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps.
His point was that strangers are out there.
We can reach them. There are paths that enable us to reach them.
Mark Granovetter, Stanford sociologist, in 1973 in his seminal essay "The Strength of Weak Ties," made the point that these weak ties that are a part of our networks, these strangers, are actually more effective at diffusing information to us than are our strong ties, the people closest to us.
He makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us, these strong ties in our lives, actually have a homogenizing effect on us.
They produce sameness.
My colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives, what kinds of new routines are possible.
We've been looking specifically at the kinds of digital platforms that have enabled us to take our possessions, those things that used to be very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses, and to make them available to people we don't know.
Whether it's our clothes, whether it's our cars, whether it's our bikes, whether it's our books or music, we are able to take our possessions now and make them available to people we've never met.
And we concluded a very important insight, which was that as people's relationships to the things in their lives change, so do their relations with other people.
And yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat.
It continues to try to predict what I need based on some past characterization of who I am, of what I've already done.
Security technology after security technology continues to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks, keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations.
Categories like "friends" and "family" and "contacts" and "colleagues" don't tell me anything about my actual relations.
A more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance, where at any given point in time, with any single person, I am both close and distant from that individual, all as a function of what I need to do right now.
People aren't close or distant.
People are always a combination of the two, and that combination is constantly changing.
What if technologies could intervene to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships?
What if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that I need right now?
Strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that I need right now, that enables me to find the sources of intimacy, of discovery, and of inspiration that I need right now.
Strangeness is not about meeting strangers.
It simply makes the point that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity.
So jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness, and it's a problem faced not just by individuals today, but also by organizations, organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities.
Whether you're a political party insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not, whether you're the government protecting social institutions like marriage and restricting access of those institutions to the few, whether you're a teenager in her bedroom who's trying to jostle her relations with her parents, strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way to new kinds of relations.
We have to change the norms.
We have to change the norms in order to enable new kinds of technologies as a basis for new kinds of businesses.
What interesting questions lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers?
How might we think differently about our relations with people?
How might we think differently about our relations with distributed groups of people?
How might we think differently about our relations with technologies, things that effectively become social participants in their own right?
The range of digital relations is extraordinary.
In the context of this broad range of digital relations, safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation.
Thank you.

<title>Maria Bezaitis: The surprising need for strangeness</title>
<description>In our digital world, social relations have become mediated by data. Without even realizing it, we're barricading ourselves against strangeness -- people and ideas that don't fit the patterns of who we already know, what we already like and where we've already been. A call for technology to deliver us to what and who we need, even if it's unfamiliar. </description>

I am the daughter of a forger, not just any forger ...
When you hear the word "forger," you often understand "mercenary."
You understand "forged currency," "forged pictures."
My father is no such man.
For 30 years of his life, he made false papers -- never for himself, always for other people, and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed.
Let me introduce him.
Here is my father at age 19.
It all began for him during World War II, when at age 17 he found himself thrust into a forged documents workshop.
He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance.
And it's not a banal story -- after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the '70s.
When I was a child I knew nothing about this, of course.
This is me in the middle making faces.
I grew up in the Paris suburbs and I was the youngest of three children.
I had a "normal" dad like everybody else, apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ...
well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather.
Anyway, he was a photographer and a street educator, and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly.
And, of course, he never talked about his past life when he was a forger.
There was, however, an incident I'm going to tell you about, that perhaps could have led me suspect something.
I was in high school and got a bad grade, a rare event for me, so I decided to hide it from my parents.
In order to do that, I set out to forge their signature.
I started working on my mother's signature, because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge.
So, I got working. I took some sheets of paper and started practicing, practicing, practicing, until I reached what I thought was a steady hand, and went into action.
Later, while checking my school bag, my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged.
She yelled at me like she never had before.
I went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets, and then I waited for my father to come back from work with, one could say, much apprehension.
I heard him come in.
I remained under the blankets. He entered my room, sat on the corner of the bed, and he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head, and when he saw me he started laughing.
He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.
Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?"
Indeed, it's rather small.
I was born in Algeria.
There I would hear people say my father was a "moudjahid" and that means "fighter."
Later on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations, and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life, especially that he had "done" World War II, that he had "done" the Algerian war.
And in my head I would be thinking that "doing" a war meant being a soldier.
But knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent, I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun.
And indeed, I was very far from the mark.
One day, while my father was working on a file for us to obtain French nationality, I happened to see some documents that caught my attention.
These are real!
These are mine, I was born an Argentinean.
But the document I happened to see that would help us build a case for the authorities was a document from the army that thanked my father for his work on behalf of the secret services.
And then, suddenly, I went "wow!"
My father, a secret agent?
It was very James Bond.
I wanted to ask him questions, which he didn't answer.
And later, I told myself that one day I would have to question him.
And then I became a mother and had a son, and finally decided it was time -- that he absolutely had to talk to us.
I had become a mother and he was celebrating his 77th birthday, and suddenly I was very, very afraid.
I feared he'd go and take his silences with him, and take his secrets with him.
I managed to convince him that it was important for us, but possibly also for other people that he shared his story.
He decided to tell it to me and I made a book, from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later.
So, his story. My father was born in Argentina.
His parents were of Russian descent.
The whole family came to settle in France in the '30s.
His parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor.
So at the age of 14 my father had to work.
And with his only diploma, his primary education certificate, he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner.
That's where he discovered something totally magical, and when he talks about it, it's fascinating -- it's the magic of dyeing chemistry.
During that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was 15.
This coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry because it was the only consolation for his sadness.
All day he would ask many questions to his boss to learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge, and at night, when no one was looking, he'd put his experience to practice.
He was mostly interested in ink bleaching.
All this to tell you that if my father became a forger, actually, it was almost by accident.
His family was Jewish, so they were hounded.
Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers.
Well, they were out, but they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers.
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents.
My father had been instilled with such respect for the law that although he was being persecuted, he'd never thought of false papers.
But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance.
In those times documents had hard covers, they were filled in by hand, and they stated your job.
In order to survive, he needed to be working. He asked the man to write "dyer."
Suddenly the man looked very, very interested.
As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks?
Of course he knew.
And suddenly the man started explaining that actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem: even the top experts could not manage to bleach an ink, called "indelible," the "Waterman" blue ink.
And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly how to bleach it.
Now, of course, the man was very impressed with this young man of 17 who could immediately give him the formula, so he recruited him.
And actually, without knowing it, my father had invented something we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case: the so-called "correction pen."
But it was only the beginning.
That's my father.
As soon as he got to the lab, even though he was the youngest, he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents.
All the movements stopped at falsifying.
But demand was ever-growing and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents.
He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch.
He started a press. He started photoengraving.
He started making rubber stamps.
He started inventing all kind of things -- with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel.
Anyway, he had to do all this because he was completely obsessed with output.
He had made a simple calculation: In one hour he could make 30 forged documents.
If he slept one hour, 30 people would die.
This sense of responsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 -- and also his guilt for being a survivor, since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not -- stayed with him all his life.
And this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years, he continued to make false papers at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices.
I'd like to talk about those sacrifices, because there were many.
There were obviously financial sacrifices because he always refused to be paid.
To him, being paid would have meant being a mercenary.
If he had accepted payment, he wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no" depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause.
So he was a photographer by day, and a forger by night for 30 years.
He was broke all of the time.
Then there were the emotional sacrifices: How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets?
How can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night?
Of course, there was another kind of sacrifice involving his family that I understood much later.
One day my father introduced me to my sister.
He also explained to me that I had a brother, too, and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four, and they were 30 years older than me.
They are both in their sixties now.
In order to write the book, I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was, who was the father she had known.
She explained that the father that she'd had would tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk.
They would get all dressed up and wait for him, but he would almost never come.
He'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call.
And then he would not come.
Then one day he totally disappeared.
Time passed, and they thought he had surely forgotten them, at first.
Then as time passed, at the end of almost two years, they thought, "Well, perhaps our father has died."
And then I understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful.
And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned, orphaned, my father was making false papers.
And if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them.
After the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine before the creation of Israel.
And then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist, he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war.
After the Algerian war, at the heart of the international resistance movements, his name circulated and the whole world came knocking at his door.
In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence: Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola.
And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid party.
He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans.
There was also Latin America.
My father helped those who resisted dictatorships in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico.
Then there was the Vietnam War.
My father made false papers for the American deserters who did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese.
Europe was not spared either.
My father made false papers for the dissidents against Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece, and even in France.
There, just once, it happened in May of 1968.
My father watched, benevolently, of course, the demonstrations of the month of May, but his heart was elsewhere, and so was his time because he had over 15 countries to serve.
Once, though, he agreed to make false papers for someone you might recognize.
He was much younger in those days, and my father agreed to make false papers to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting.
He told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant and the least useful he'd had to make in all his life.
But, he agreed to do it, even though Daniel Cohn-Bendit's life was not in danger, just because it was a good opportunity to mock the authorities, and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders -- and that ideas have no borders.
All my childhood, while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales, my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes with unshakeable utopias who managed to make miracles.
And those heroes did not need an army behind them.
Anyhow, nobody would have followed them, except for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage.
I understood much later that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep.
I asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make, he ever had any regrets.
He said no.
He told me that he would have been unable to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything.
He was persuaded, and he's still convinced that another world is possible -- a world where no one would ever need a forger.
He's still dreaming about it.
My father is here in the room today.
His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up.
Thank you.

The brilliant playwright, Adrienne Kennedy, wrote a volume called "People Who Led to My Plays."
And if I were to write a volume, it would be called, "Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions" because my work, in understanding art and in understanding culture, has come by following artists, by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are.
J.J. from "Good Times," significant to many people of course because of "Dy-no-mite," but perhaps more significant as the first, really, black artist on primetime TV.
Jean-Michel Basquiat, important to me because [he was] the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what I was about to enter into.
My overall project is about art -- specifically, about black artists -- very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves.
My interest is in artists who understand and rewrite history, who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger world of art, but who have created new places for us to see and understand.
I'm showing two artists here, Glenn Ligon and Carol Walker, two of many who really form for me the essential questions that I wanted to bring as a curator to the world.
I was interested in the idea of why and how I could create a new story, a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world.
And to do this, I knew that I had to see the way in which artists work, understand the artist's studio as a laboratory, imagine, then, reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper -- asking questions, providing the space to look and to think about answers.
In 1994, when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum, I made an exhibition called Black Male.
It looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art.
It sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for dialogue -- complicated dialogue, dialogue with many, many points of entry -- and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas.
This exhibition included over 20 artists of various ages and races, but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view.
What was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator, as a catalyst, for this dialogue.
One of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with idea of how powerful images can be and people's understanding of themselves and each other.
I'm showing you two works, one on the right by Leon Golub, one on the left by Robert Colescott.
And in the course of the exhibition -- which was contentious, controversial and ultimately, for me, life-changing in my sense of what art could be -- a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other.
And she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was, as it related, for her, to the idea of how black people had been represented.
And she pointed to the image on the right as an example, to me, of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media.
She then assigned these works racial identities, basically saying to me that the work on the right, clearly, was made by a black artist, the work on the left, clearly, by a white artist, when, in effect, that was the opposite case: Bob Colescott, African-American artist; Leon Golub, a white artist.
The point of that for me was to say -- in that space, in that moment -- that I really, more than anything, wanted to understand how images could work, how images did work, and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives to work through these images.
Fast-forward and I end up in Harlem; home for many of black America, very much the psychic heart of the black experience, really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed.
Harlem now, sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century, looking both backwards and forwards ...
I always say Harlem is an interesting community because, unlike many other places, it thinks of itself in the past, present and the future simultaneously; no one speaks of it just in the now.
It's always what it was and what it can be.
And, in thinking about that, then my second project, the second question I ask is: Can a museum be a catalyst in a community?
Can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves?
This is Harlem, actually, on January 20th, thinking about itself in a very wonderful way.
So I work now at The Studio Museum in Harlem, thinking about exhibitions there, thinking about what it means to discover art's possibility.
Now, what does this mean to some of you?
In some cases, I know that many of you are involved in cross-cultural dialogues, you're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation.
Think about the place that artists can play in that -- that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that I work towards, in working with young, black artists.
Think about artists, not as content providers, though they can be brilliant at that, but, again, as real catalysts.
The Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s.
And I bring this up because it's important to locate this practice in history.
To look at 1968, in the incredible historic moment that it is, and think of the arc that has happened since then, to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the legacy of important African-American artists to the history of art in this country like Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis, Romare Bearden.
And then, of course, to bring us to today.
In 1975, Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University.
After his lecture, a student got up and said to him, "Give us a poem."
And Mohammed Ali said, "Me, we."
A profound statement about the individual and the community.
The space in which now, in my project of discovery, of thinking about artists, of trying to define what might be black art cultural movement of the 21st century.
What that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment, the "me, we" seems incredibly prescient totally important.
To this end, the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions, all titled with an F -- Freestyle, Frequency and Flow -- which have set out to discover and define the young, black artists working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years.
This series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now, at this point in history, to see art as a catalyst; what it means now, at this point in history, as we define and redefine culture, black culture specifically in my case, but culture generally.
I named this group of artists around an idea, which I put out there called post-black, really meant to define them as artists who came and start their work now, looking back at history but start in this moment, historically.
It is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking.
What does it mean, right now, to be African-American in America?
What can artwork say about this?
Where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation?
Really, most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring.
Their works for me are about, not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that their minds imagine, that their visions create and put out there in the world, but more, perhaps, importantly, through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation, as well as in the future.
I am continually amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be.
I am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work.
It is why I look to art.
It's why I ask questions of art.
It is why I make exhibitions.
Now, this exhibition, as I said, 40 young artists done over the course of eight years, and for me it's about considering the implications.
It's considering the implications of what this generation has to say to the rest of us.
It's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as their work travels, but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us.
It's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it, and imagining, particularly in urban America, about the nurturing of the spirit.
Now, where, perhaps, does this end up right now?
For me, it is about re-imagining this cultural discourse in an international context.
So the last iteration of this project has been called Flow, with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world; really looking, not so much from Harlem and out, but looking across, and Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa.
And as many of us think about that continent and think about what if means to us all in the 21st century, I have begun that looking through artists, through artworks, and imagining what they can tell us about the future, what they tell us about our future, and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue.
So, what do I discover when I look at artworks?
What do I think about when I think about art?
I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works, the discovery of exciting works.
But, really, it has been what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition, to talk about beauty, to talk about power, to talk about ourselves, and to talk and speak to each other.
That's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world.
Thank you.

["Oedipus Rex"] ["The Lion King"] ["Titus"] ["Frida"] ["The Magic Flute"] ["Across The Universe"] Julie Taymor: Thank you. Thank you very much.
That's a few samples of the theater, opera and films that I have done over the last 20 years.
But what I'd like to begin with right now is to take you back to a moment that I went through in Indonesia, which is a seminal moment in my life and, like all myths, these stories need to be retold and told, lest we forget them.
And when I'm in the turbulent times, as we know, that I am right now, through the crucible and the fire of transformation, which is what all of you do, actually.
Anybody who creates knows there's that point where it hasn't quite become the phoenix or the burnt char.
And I am right there on the edge, which I'll tell you about, another story.
I want to go back to Indonesia where I was about 21, 22 years, a long time ago, on a fellowship.
And I found myself, after two years there and performing and learning, on the island of Bali, on the edge of a crater, Gunung Batur.
And I was in a village where there was an initiation ceremony for the young men, a rite of passage.
Little did I know that it was mine as well.
And as I sat in this temple square under this gigantic beringin banyan tree, in the dark, there was no electricity, just the full moon, down in this empty square, and I heard the most beautiful sounds, like a Charles Ives concert as I listened to the gamelan music from all the different villagers that came for this once-every-five-years ceremony.
And I thought I was alone in the dark under this tree.
And all of a sudden, out of the dark, from the other end of the square, I saw the glint of mirrors lit by the moon.
And these 20 old men who I'd seen before all of a sudden stood up in these full warrior costumes with the headdress and the spears, and no one was in the square, and I was hidden in the shadows.
No one was there, and they came out, and they did this incredible dance.
"Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha."
And they moved their bodies and they came forward, and the lights bounced off these costumes.
And I've been in theater since I was 11 years old, and performing, creating, and I went, "Who are they performing for with these elaborate costumes, these extraordinary headdresses?"
And I realized that they were performing for God, whatever that means.
But somehow, it didn't matter about the publicity.
There was no money involved.
It wasn't going to be written down. It was no news.
And there were these incredible artists that felt for me like an eternity as they performed.
The next moment, as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows, a young man with a propane lantern came on, hung it up on a tree, set up a curtain.
The village square was filled with hundreds of people.
And they put on an opera all night long.
Human beings needed the light.
They needed the light to see.
So what I gained and gathered from this incredible, seminal moment in my life as a young artist was that you must be true to what you believe as an artist all the way through, but you also have to be aware that the audience is out there in our lives at this time, and they also need the light.
And it's this incredible balance that I think that we walk when we are creating something that is breaking ground, that's trying to do something you've never seen before, that imaginary world where you actually don't know where you're going to end up, that's the fine line on the edge of a crater that I have walked my whole life.
What I would like to do now is to tell you a little bit about how I work. Let's take "The Lion King."
You saw many examples of my work up there, but it's one that people know.
I start with the notion of the ideograph.
An ideograph is like a brush painting, a Japanese brush painting.
Three strokes, you get the whole bamboo forest.
I go to the concept of "The Lion King" and I say, "What is the essence of it?
What is the abstraction?
If I were to reduce this entire story into one image, what would it be?"
The circle. The circle. It's so obvious.
The circle of life. The circle of Mufasa's mask.
The circle that, when we come to Act II and there's a drought, how do you express drought?
It's a circle of silk on the floor that disappears into the hole in the stage floor.
The circle of life comes in the wheels of the gazelles that leap.
And you see the mechanics.
And being a theater person, what I know and love about the theater is that when the audience comes in and they suspend their disbelief, when you see men walking or women walking with a platter of grass on their heads, you know it's the savanna.
You don't question that.
I love the apparent truth of theater.
I love that people are willing to fill in the blanks.
The audience is willing to say, "Oh, I know that's not a real sun.
You took pieces of sticks.
You added silk to the bottom.
You suspended these pieces. You let it fall flat on the floor.
And as it rises with the strings, I see that it's a sun.
But the beauty of it is that it's just silk and sticks.
And in a way, that is what makes it spiritual.
That's what moves you.
It's not the actual literal sunrise that's coming.
It's the art of it.
So in the theater, as much as the story is critical and the book and the language, the telling of the story, how it's told, the mechanics, the methods that you use, is equal to the story itself.
And I'm one who loves high tech and low tech.
So I could go from -- For instance, I'll show you some "Spider-Man" later, these incredible machines that move people along.
But the fact is, without the dancer who knows how to use his body and swing on those wires, it's nothing.
So now I'm going to show you some clips from the other big project of my life this year, "The Tempest."
It's a movie. I did "The Tempest" on a stage three times in the theater since 1984, '86, and I love the play.
I did it always with a male Prospero.
And all of a sudden, I thought, "Well, who am I gonna get to play Prospero?
Why not Helen Mirren? She's a great actor. Why not?"
And this material really did work for a woman equally as well.
from "The Tempest."
Prospera: Hast thou, spirit, performed to the point the tempest that I bade thee?
Ariel: I boarded the king's ship. In every cabin, I flamed amazement.
Prospera: At first sight, they have changed eyes.
Miranda: Do you love me?
Ferdinand: Beyond all limit.
HM: They are both in either's powers.
Trinculo: Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.
Looking for business, governor?
Caliban: Hast thou not dropped from heaven?
Stephano: Out of the moon, I do assure thee.
Prospera: Caliban!
Caliban: This island is mine.
Prospera: For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps.
Antonio: Here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon.
Sebastian: Draw thy sword.
And I, the king, shall love thee.
Prospera: I will plague them all, even to roaring.
Ariel: I have made you mad.
Prospera: We are such stuff as dreams are made on.
and our little life is rounded with a sleep.
JT: Okay.
So I went from theater, doing "The Tempest" on the stage in a very low-budget production many years ago, and I love the play, and I also think it's Shakespeare's last play, and it really lends itself, as you can see, to cinema.
But I'm just going to give you a little example about how one stages it in theater and then how one takes that same idea or story and moves it into cinema.
The ideograph that I talked to you about before, what is it for "The Tempest"?
What, if I were to boil it down, would be the one image that I could And it was the sand castle, the idea of nurture versus nature, that we build these civilizations -- she speaks about it at the end, Helen Mirren's Prospera -- we build them, but under nature, under the grand tempest, these cloud-capped towers, these gorgeous palaces will fade and there will -- leave not a rack behind.
So in the theater, I started the play, it was a black sand rake, white cyc, and there was a little girl, Miranda, on the horizon, building a drip castle, a sand castle.
And as she was there on the edge of that stage, two stagehands all in black with watering cans ran along the top and started to pour water on the sand castle, and the sand castle started to drip and sink, but before it did, the audience saw the black-clad stagehands.
The medium was apparent. It was banal. We saw it.
But as they started to pour the water, the light changed from showing you the black-clad stagehands to focusing, this rough magic that we do in theater, it focused right on the water itself.
And all of a sudden, the audience's perspective changes.
It becomes something magically large.
It becomes the rainstorm.
The masked actors, the puppeteers, they disappear, and the audience makes that leap into this world, into this imaginary world of "The Tempest" actually happening.
Now the difference when I went and did it in the cinema, I started the actual movie with a close-up of a sand castle, a black sand castle, and what cinema can do is, by using camera, perspective, and also long shots and close-ups, it started on a close-up of the sand castle, and as it pulled away, you saw that it was a miniature sitting in the palm of the girl's hands.
And so I could play with the medium, and why I move from one medium to another is to be able to do this.
Now I'm going to take you to "Spider-Man."
Peter Parker: Standing on the precipice, I can soar away from this. JT: We're trying to do everything in live theater that you can't do in two dimensions in film and television.
PP: Rise above yourself and take control. George Tsypin: We're looking at New York from a Spider-Man point of view.
Spider Man is not bound by gravity.
Manhattan in the show is not bound by gravity either.
PP: Be yourself and rise above it all. Ensemble: Sock! Pow! Slam! Scratch! Danny Ezralow: I don't want you to even think there's a choreographer.
It's real, what's happening.
I prefer you to see people moving, and you're going, "Whoa, what was that?"
JT: If I give enough movement in the sculpture, and the actor moves their head, you feel like it's alive.
It's really comic book live. It's a comic book coming alive.
Bono: They're mythologies.
They're modern myths, these comic book heroes.
PP: They believe. JT: Ohhhh. What was that?
Circus, rock 'n' roll, drama.
What the hell are we doing up there on that stage?
Well, one last story, very quickly.
After I was in that village, I crossed the lake, and I saw that the volcano was erupting on the other side, Gunung Batur, and there was a dead volcano next to the live volcano.
I didn't think I'd be swallowed by the volcano, and I am here.
But it's very easy to climb up, is it not?
You hold on to the roots, you put your foot in the little rocks and climb up there, and you get to the top, and I was with a good friend who was an actor, and we said, "Let's go up there.
Let's see if we can come close to the edge of that live volcano."
And we climbed up and we got to the very top, and we're on the edge, on this precipice, Roland disappears into the sulfur smoke at the volcano at the other end, and I'm up there alone on this incredible precipice.
Did you hear the lyrics?
I'm on the precipice looking down into a dead volcano to my left.
To my right is sheer shale. It's coming off.
I'm in thongs and sarongs. It was many years ago.
And no hiking boots.
And he's disappeared, this mad French gypsy actor, off in the smoke, and I realize, I can't go back the way that I've come. I can't.
So I throw away my camera. I throw away my thongs, and I looked at the line straight in front of me, and I got down on all fours like a cat, and I held with my knees to either side of this line in front of me, for 30 yards or 30 feet, I don't know.
The wind was massively blowing, and the only way I could get to the other side was to look at the line straight in front of me.
I know you've all been there.
I'm in the crucible right now.
It's my trial by fire.
It's my company's trials by fire.
We survive because our theme song is "Rise Above."
Boy falls from the sky, rise above.
It's right there in the palm of both of our hands, of all of my company's hands.
I have beautiful collaborators, and we as creators only get there all together.
I know you understand that.
And you just stay going forward, and then you see this extraordinary thing in front of your eyes.
Thank you.

<title>Julie Taymor: Spider-Man, The Lion King and life on the creative edge</title>
<description>Showing spectacular clips from productions such as Frida, The Tempest and The Lion King, director Julie Taymor describes a life spent immersed in theater and the movies. Filmed right as controversy over her Broadway production of Spider- Turn Off the Dark was at its peak, she candidly describes the tensions inherent within her creative process, as she strives both to capture the essence of a story--and produce images and experiences unlike anything else.</description>
<keywords>creativity,entertainment,film,theater</keywords>

I really am honored to be here, and as Chris said, it's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa.
My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning.
I had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead, given away most everything that I owned, and arrived with all the essentials -- some poetry, a few clothes, and, of course, a guitar -- because I was going to save the world, and I thought I would just start with the African continent.
But literally within days of arriving I was told, in no uncertain terms, by a number of West African women, that Africans didn't want saving, thank you very much, least of all not by me.
I was too young, unmarried, I had no children, didn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful.
And so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life, and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening.
I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well, so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda, and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986, to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.
And I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere, meaning "to go forward with enthusiasm." And while we were doing it, I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too.
And so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakery that was run by 20 prostitutes.
And, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group, and what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive.
And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language, and how what we call people so often distances us from them, and makes them little.
I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business, that, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person, who essentially spent 600 dollars a month to keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods, and living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty.
So, I made a deal with the women. I said, "Look, we get rid of the charity side, and we run this as a business and I'll help you."
They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course, things are always harder than you think they're going to be.
First of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team, and we clearly aren't the A-Team here, so let's -- I did all this training.
And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets of Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket, and I sold all these little doughnuts to people, and I came back, and I was like, "You see?"
And the women said, "You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?" And like -- -- it's a good point.
So then I went the whole American way, with competitions, team and individual. Completely failed, but over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way.
And they started listening to the marketplace, and they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips, and sorghum bread, and before you knew it, we had cornered the Kigali market, and the women were earning three to four times the national average.
And with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery, so let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea."
And I said, "Well, what color do you want to paint it?" And they said, "Well, you choose." And I said, "No, no, I'm learning to listen.
You choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country -- not mine."
But they wouldn't give me an answer.
So, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by, and finally I said, "Well, how about blue?"
And they said, "Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue."
So, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all, and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains, and on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo, and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim, like a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky.
So, blue, blue, everything became blue.
The walls were blue, the windows were blue, the sidewalk out front was painted blue.
And Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T," the women's hips were swaying and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.
And at the end of it, we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done, and I said, "It is so beautiful."
And the women said, "It really is."
And I said, "And I think the color is perfect," and they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence, and I said, "What?"
And she said, "Nothing." And I said, "What?"
And she said, "Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green." And -- -- I learned then that listening isn't just about patience, but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long, it's really hard to say what you mean.
And, mostly because people never really ask you, and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.
And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting, but it's also learning how better to ask questions.
And so, I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years, doing these two things, and it was an extraordinary time in my life.
And it taught me three lessons that I think are so important for us today, and certainly in the work that I do.
The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
As Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice, and that is fundamental to dignity.
But as human beings, we also want to see each other, and we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.
The second is that traditional charity and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty.
I think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point, which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty.
Yes, we ran this as a business, but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support that came into the training, and the management support, the strategic advice and, maybe most important of all, the access to new contacts, networks and new markets.
And so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy.
And on a macro level -- some of the speakers have inferred that even health should be privatized.
But, having had a father with heart disease, and realizing that what our family could afford was not what he should have gotten, and having a good friend step in to help, I really believe that all people deserve access to health at prices they can afford.
I think the market can help us figure that out, but there's got to be a charitable component, or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.
And so, it was really those lessons that made me decide to build Acumen Fund about six years ago.
It's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor, a few oxymorons in one sentence.
It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations, and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans in both for-profit and nonprofit entities that deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water to low income people in South Asia and Africa, so that they can make their own choices.
We've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises, and have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs, and delivered tens of millions of services to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them.
I want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa.
Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs who are committed to service, and who really know the markets.
Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise, and both of them, because they're manufacturers, create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly, because they're in the malaria sector, and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria.
And so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.
The first one is called Advanced Bio-Extracts Limited.
It's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues.
These are old-hand farmers who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs in Kenya over the last 30 years.
Now, this plant is an Artemisia plant; it's the basic component for artemisinin, which is the best-known treatment for malaria.
It's indigenous to China and the Far East, but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa, Patrick and his colleagues said, "Let's bring it here, because it's a high value-add product."
The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize.
And so, using patient capital -- money that they could raise early on, that actually got below market returns and was willing to go the long haul and be combined with management assistance, strategic assistance -- they've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers.
So that's about 50,000 people affected.
And I think some of you may have visited -- these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe, who help them become more self-sufficient.
They buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory, which was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis, who has a real interest in getting the powder so that they can make Coartem.
Acumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half, both on looking at a new business plan, and what does expansion look like, helping with management support and helping to do term sheets and raise capital.
And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so. Because the company was literally 10 days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem, when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.
And we called all of the social investors we know.
Now, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa and understand the importance of agriculture, and they even helped the farmers.
And even when we explained that if ABE goes away, all those 7,500 jobs go away too, we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.
And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.
So Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans, and the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are now in the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level, and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa.
This is Samuel. He's a farmer.
He was actually living in the Kibera slums when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential.
So he moved back to the farm, and, long story short, they now have seven acres under cultivation.
Samuel's kids are in private school, and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production -- dignity being more important than wealth.
The next one, many of you know.
I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago, and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing, which is one of the great, real companies in East Africa.
It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.
And this is really a story about a public-private solution that has really worked.
It started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology essentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide, so you could create a bed net, a malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped.
It could alter the vector, but like Artemisia, it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility, Sumitomo said, "Why don't we experiment with whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?"
UNICEF came forward and said, "We'll buy most of the nets, and then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's and the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free."
Acumen came in with the patient capital, and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur that we would all partner with here in Africa, and Exxon provided the initial resin.
Well, in looking around for entrepreneurs, there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah, in A to Z manufacturing company.
It's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing.
It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania, and continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.
And so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment to work with malaria.
And, long story short, again, they've been so successful.
In our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003.
We thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.
This year, they are now producing eight million nets a year, and they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled.
They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo.
And so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa, and from a public health perspective, these are real successes.
But it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty, because it's not long-term sustainable.
It's a company with one big customer.
And if avian flu hits, or for any other reason the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses.
And so, Anuj and Acumen have been talking about testing the private sector, because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that, look, in a country like Tanzania, 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day.
It costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these, and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it, so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.
Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.
And we said, "Well, there's another option.
Let's use the market as the best listening device we have, and understand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.
We can start building local distribution, and actually, it can cost the public sector much less."
And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z, a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.
One, that people will pay different prices, but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it.
And when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say about what they like and what they don't like.
And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work.
But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed because of the patient capital, we've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector to distribute, and a dollar to buy the net.
So then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market, we have a choice.
We can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero, or we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net, costing the public sector another six dollars a net, give the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system that might, over time, start sustaining itself.
We've got to start having conversations like this, and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market, but also to bring other people to the table around it.
Whenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella.
She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines.
She grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor, didn't have very much education.
She moved to the United States, where she met my grandfather, who was a cement hauler, and they had nine children. Three of them died as babies.
My grandmother had tuberculosis, and she worked in a sewing machine shop, making shirts for about 10 cents an hour.
She, like so many of the women I see at A to Z, worked hard every day, understood what suffering was, had a deep faith in God, loved her children and would never have accepted a handout.
But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace, and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education, her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams.
I look around at my siblings and my cousins -- and as I said, there are a lot of us -- and I see teachers and musicians, hedge fund managers, designers.
One sister who makes other people's wishes come true.
And my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers, and I think about all the people across this continent who are working hard every day, is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility, and that they also can believe and get access to services, so that their children, too, can live those lives of great purpose.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions, get out of our ideological boxes.
It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to success.
It takes opening your arms, both, wide, and expecting very little love in return, but demanding accountability, and bringing the accountability to the table as well.
And most of all, most of all, it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience, whether we are rich or poor, African or non-African, local or diaspora, left or right, to really start listening to each other.
Thank you.

Hi there.
I'm going to be talking a little bit about music, machines and life.
Or, more specifically, what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video.
Some of you may recognize this image.
This is the opening frame of the video that we created.
We'll be showing the video at the end, but before we do, I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted.
Now, when we first started talking to OK Go -- the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" -- we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.
And we were very excited about this because, of course, they have a history of dancing with machines.
They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again."
50-million-plus views on YouTube.
Four guys dancing on treadmills, no cuts, just a static camera.
A fantastically viral and wonderful video.
So we were really excited about working with them.
And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.
And they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine.
Now, for those of you who don't know, a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption, an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task.
So we were excited by this idea, and we started talking about exactly what it would look like.
And we came up with some parameters, because, you know, building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations, but it also is pretty wide open.
And we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video.
So we came up with a list of requirements, the "10 commandments," and they were, in order of ascending difficulty: The first is "No magic."
Everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer.
The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it, then we couldn't use it in the video.
They wanted band integration, that is, the machine acting upon the band members, specifically not the other way around.
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.
So as the song picks up emotion, so should the machine get grander in its process.
They wanted us to make use of the space.
So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using, divided between two floors.
It included an exterior loading dock.
We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.
They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.
The machine itself would start the music.
So the machine would get started, it would travel some distance, reacting along the way, hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback.
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.
And speaking of synchronization, they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way.
Okay.
They wanted it to end precisely on time.
Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.
And they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song.
And as if that wasn't enough, all of these incredibly complicating things, right, they wanted it in one shot.
Okay.
So, just some statistics about what we went through in the process.
The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions.
It took us 85 takes to get it on film to our satisfaction.
Of those 85 takes, only three actually successfully completed their run.
We destroyed two pianos and 10 televisions in the process.
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.
And we lost one high-heeled shoe when one of our engineers, Heather Knight, left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner, and returned back to the build -- and left it in a pile of stuff.
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use" and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.
And it's actually in the machine.
So what did we learn from all of this?
Well, having completed this, we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things.
And we learned that small stuff stinks.
Little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust, and they fall out of the tracks, the exact angles makes it hard to get right.
And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.
It doesn't matter what temperature it is, doesn't matter what's in its way; it will pretty much get where it needs to go.
But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start, so that we would have somewhere to go.
And so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it.
Small stuff stinks, but, of course, it's essential, right?
What else? Planning is incredibly important.
You know, we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things.
It's been said that, "No battle plan survives contact with the enemy."
I think our enemy was physics -- and she's a cruel mistress.
Often, we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever.
And so while planning is important, so is flexibility.
These are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine.
So also, put reliable stuff last, the stuff that's going to run every time.
Again, small to large is relevant here.
The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big, real car near the end of the video.
The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.
The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that's a problem.
But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.
So you put that up front so that, if it fails, at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing.
Life can be messy.
There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.
Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.
And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it.
So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad, "This Too Shall Pass."
Thank you very much.
And now to introduce their music video, we have OK Go.
OK Go: An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC.
We are OK Go.
What are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what!
It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC.
We are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?"
I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me.
Let me start again.
We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities."
Tim's sundial hat.
Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?
Sorry, start again.
Dogs.
Hello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go, and this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass."
[unclear] Kay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.
That one's pretty good. It's getting better.
You know you can't keep letting it get you down And you can't keep dragging that dead weight around If there ain't all that much to lug around Better run like hell when you hit the ground When the morning comes When the morning comes You can't stop these kids from dancing Why would you want to? Especially when you're already getting yours Cuz if your mind don't move and your knees don't bend Well don't go blaming the kids again When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes Let it go This too shall pass Let it go This too shall pass You know you can't keep letting it get you down No, you can't keep letting it get you down Let it go This too shall pass When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes

I'd like to show you a video of some of the models I work with.
They're all the perfect size, and they don't have an ounce of fat.
Did I mention they're gorgeous?
And they're scientific models?
As you might have guessed, I'm a tissue engineer, and this is a video of some of the beating heart that I've engineered in the lab.
And one day we hope that these tissues can serve as replacement parts for the human body.
But what I'm going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models.
Well, let's think about the drug screening process for a moment.
You go from drug formulation, lab testing, animal testing, and then clinical trials, which you might call human testing, before the drugs get to market.
It costs a lot of money, a lot of time, and sometimes, even when a drug hits the market, it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people.
And the later it fails, the worse the consequences.
It all boils down to two issues. One, humans are not rats, and two, despite our incredible similarities to one another, actually those tiny differences between you and I have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs and how those drugs affect us.
So what if we had better models in the lab that could not only mimic us better than rats but also reflect our diversity?
Let's see how we can do it with tissue engineering.
One of the key technologies that's really important is what's called induced pluripotent stem cells.
They were developed in Japan pretty recently.
Okay, induced pluripotent stem cells.
They're a lot like embryonic stem cells except without the controversy.
We induce cells, okay, say, skin cells, by adding a few genes to them, culturing them, and then harvesting them.
So they're skin cells that can be tricked, kind of like cellular amnesia, into an embryonic state.
So without the controversy, that's cool thing number one.
Cool thing number two, you can grow any type of tissue out of them: brain, heart, liver, you get the picture, but out of your cells.
So we can make a model of your heart, your brain on a chip.
Generating tissues of predictable density and behavior is the second piece, and will be really key towards getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery.
And this is a schematic of a bioreactor we're developing in our lab to help engineer tissues in a more modular, scalable way.
Going forward, imagine a massively parallel version of this with thousands of pieces of human tissue.
It would be like having a clinical trial on a chip.
But another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells is that if we take some skin cells, let's say, from people with a genetic disease and we engineer tissues out of them, we can actually use tissue-engineering techniques to generate models of those diseases in the lab.
Here's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard.
He generated neurons from these induced pluripotent stem cells from patients who have Lou Gehrig's Disease, and he differentiated them into neurons, and what's amazing is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease.
So with disease models like these, we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before, and maybe discover drugs even faster.
This is another example of patient-specific stem cells that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa.
This is a degeneration of the retina.
It's a disease that runs in my family, and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure.
So some people think that these models sound well and good, but ask, "Well, are these really as good as the rat?"
The rat is an entire organism, after all, with interacting networks of organs.
A drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver, and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat.
Don't you miss all that with these tissue-engineered models?
Well, this is another trend in the field.
By combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics, the field is actually evolving towards just that, a model of the entire ecosystem of the body, complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart.
These systems are really hard to build, but we're just starting to be able to get there, and so, watch out.
But that's not even all of it, because once a drug is approved, tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments.
This is an example that you might care about someday, and I hope you never do, because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer.
Wouldn't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs This is an example from Karen Burg's lab, where they're using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells and study its progressions and treatments.
And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next, and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies.
And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed, you can see, going forward, that tissue engineering is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening at every single step of the path: disease models making for better drug formulations, massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing, reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials, and individualized therapies that disrupt what we even consider to be a market at all.
Essentially, we're dramatically speeding up that feedback between developing a molecule and learning about how it acts in the human body.
Our process for doing this is essentially transforming biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology, helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster, more cheaply and more effectively.
It gives new meaning to models against animal testing, doesn't it?
Thank you.

<title>Nina Tandon: Could tissue engineering mean personalized medicine?</title>
<description>Each of our bodies is utterly unique, which is a lovely thought until it comes to treating an illness -- when every body reacts differently, often unpredictably, to standard treatment. Tissue engineer Nina Tandon talks about a possible solution: Using pluripotent stem cells to make personalized models of organs on which to test new drugs and treatments, and storing them on computer chips. </description>

Everyone's familiar with cancer, but we don't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease.
The Tasmanian devil has shown us that, not only can cancer be a contagious disease, but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction.
So first of all, what is a Tasmanian devil?
Many of you might be familiar with Taz, the cartoon character, the one that spins around and around and around.
But not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil, and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial.
A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo.
The Tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes.
The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger, and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.
[The] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania, which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of Australia.
And despite their ferocious appearance, Tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals.
In fact, growing up in Tasmania, it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a Tasmanian devil in the wild.
But the Tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline.
And in fact, there's concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within 20 to 30 years.
And the reason for that is the emergence of a new disease, a contagious cancer.
The story begins in 1996 when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a Tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face.
At the time, this was thought to be a one-off.
Animals, just like humans, sometimes get strange tumors.
However, we now believe that this is the first sighting of a new disease, which is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania.
The disease was first sighted in the northeast of Tasmania in 1996 and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave.
Now there's only a small part of the population, which remains unaffected.
This disease appears first as tumors, usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected Tasmanian devils.
These tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors, such as these ones here.
And the next image I'm going to show is quite gruesome.
But inevitably, these tumors progress towards being enormous, ulcerating tumors like this one here.
This one in particular sticks in my mind, because this is the first case of this disease that I saw myself.
And I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil with this huge ulcerating, foul-smelling tumor inside her mouth that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw.
She hadn't eaten for days.
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms.
Her body was riddled with secondary tumors.
And yet, she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils in her pouch.
Of course, they died along with the mother.
They were too young to survive without their mother.
In fact, in the area where she comes from, more than 90 percent of the Tasmanian devil population has already died of this disease.
Scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer, this infectious cancer, that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population.
And our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women, which is spread by a virus, and to the AIDS epidemic, which is associated with a number of different types of cancer.
All the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus.
However, we now know -- and I'll tell you right now -- that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus.
In fact, the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister, and something that we hadn't really thought of before.
But in order for me to explain what that is, I need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself.
Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year.
One in three people in this room will develop cancer at some stage in their lives.
I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when I was only 14.
Cancer occurs when a single cell in your body acquires a set of random mutations in important genes that cause that cell to start to produce more and more and more copies of itself.
Paradoxically, once established, natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer.
Natural selection is survival of the fittest.
And when you have a population of fast-dividing cancer cells, if one of them acquires new mutations, which allow them to grow more quickly, acquire nutrients more successfully, invade the body, they'll be selected for by evolution.
That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat.
It evolves.
Throw a drug at it, and resistant cells will grow back.
An amazing fact is that, given the right environment and the right nutrients, a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever.
However cancer is constrained by living inside our bodies, and its continued growth, its spreading through our bodies and eating away at our tissues, leads to the death of the cancer patient and also to the death of the cancer itself.
So cancer could be thought of as a strange, short-lived, self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end.
But that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation.
And the answer came from studying the Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA.
This was work from many people, but I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that I did a few years ago.
The next slide is going to be gruesome.
This is Jonas.
He's a Tasmanian devil that we found with a large tumor on his face.
And being a geneticist, I'm always interested to look at DNA and mutations.
So I took this opportunity to collect some samples from Jonas' tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body.
I took these back to the lab.
I extracted DNA from them.
And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA, and compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor to that of the rest of his body, I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile.
In fact, Jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you.
What this told us was that Jonas' tumor did not arise from cells of his own body.
In fact, more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in Jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil -- and Jonas was clearly a male.
So how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on Jonas' face?
Well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers from all around Tasmania.
We found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA.
Think about that for a minute.
That means that all of these cancers actually are the same cancer that arose once from one individual devil, that have broken free of that first devil's body and spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population.
But how can a cancer spread in a population?
Well the final piece of the puzzle came when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild.
They tend to bite each other, often quite ferociously and usually on the face.
We think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor, get into the saliva.
When the devil bites another devil, it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil, so the tumor continues to grow.
So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer.
It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.
It spreads through the population, has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system, and it's the only cancer that we know of that's threatening an entire species with extinction.
But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils, why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans?
Well the answer is, it has.
This is Kimbo.
He's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya.
Last year, his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region.
She took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting.
And if you're squeamish, please look away now.
He discovered this, a huge bleeding tumor at the base of Kimbo's penis.
The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor, a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs.
And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells, so is this dog cancer.
But this dog cancer is quite remarkable, because it spread all around the world.
And in fact, these same cells that are affecting Kimbo here are also found affecting dogs in New York City, in mountain villages in the Himalayas and in Outback Australia.
We also believe this cancer might be very old.
In fact, genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old, which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the Neanderthals.
This cancer is remarkable.
It's the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of.
It's a living relic of the distant past.
So we've seen that this can happen in animals.
Could cancers be contagious between people?
Well this is a question which fascinated Chester Southam, a cancer doctor in the 1950s.
Ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else.
And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in 1957 injecting cancer into a volunteer, who in this case was an inmate in Ohio State Penitentiary.
Most of the people that Dr. Southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells.
But a small number of them did, and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill -- whose immune systems were probably compromised.
What this tells us, ethical issues aside, is that ...
it's probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred between people.
However, under some circumstances, it can happen.
And I think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future.
So just finally, cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments.
But that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer.
In fact, I believe, given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth, we can defeat cancer.
My personal aim is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer.
Let's prevent the Tasmanian devil from being the first animal to go extinct from cancer.
Thank you.

<title>Elizabeth Murchison: Fighting a contagious cancer</title>

I'm going to talk to you about optimism -- or more precisely, the optimism bias.
It's a cognitive illusion that we've been studying in my lab for the past few years, and 80 percent of us have it.
It's our tendency to overestimate our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events.
So we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer, being in a car accident.
We overestimate our longevity, our career prospects.
In short, we're more optimistic than realistic, but we are oblivious to the fact.
Take marriage for example.
In the Western world, divorce rates are about 40 percent.
That means that out of five married couples, two will end up splitting their assets.
But when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce, they estimate it at zero percent.
And even divorce lawyers, who should really know better, hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce.
So it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce, but they are more likely to remarry.
In the words of Samuel Johnson, "Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience."
So if we're married, we're more likely to have kids.
And we all think our kids will be especially talented.
This, by the way, is my two-year-old nephew, Guy.
And I just want to make it absolutely clear that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias, because he is in fact uniquely talented.
And I'm not alone.
Out of four British people, three said that they were optimistic about the future of their own families.
That's 75 percent.
But only 30 percent said that they thought families in general are doing better than a few generations ago.
And this is a really important point, because we're optimistic about ourselves, we're optimistic about our kids, we're optimistic about our families, but we're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us, and we're somewhat pessimistic about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country.
But private optimism about our own personal future remains persistent.
And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay, but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so.
Now I'm a scientist, I do experiments.
So to show you what I mean, I'm going to do an experiment here with you.
So I'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics, and I want you to think for each of these abilities where you stand relative to the rest of the population.
The first one is getting along well with others.
Who here believes they're at the bottom 25 percent?
Okay, that's about 10 people out of 1,500.
Who believes they're at the top 25 percent?
That's most of us here.
Okay, now do the same for your driving ability.
How interesting are you?
How attractive are you?
How honest are you?
And finally, how modest are you?
So most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities.
Now this is statistically impossible.
We can't all be better than everyone else.
But if we believe we're better than the other guy, well that means that we're more likely to get that promotion, to remain married, because we're more social, more interesting.
And it's a global phenomenon.
The optimism bias has been observed in many different countries -- in Western cultures, in non-Western cultures, in females and males, in kids, in the elderly.
It's quite widespread.
But the question is, is it good for us?
So some people say no.
Some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations.
I think the logic goes something like this: If we don't expect greatness, if we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful, well we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen.
And if we're not disappointed when good things don't happen, and we're pleasantly surprised when they do, we will be happy.
So it's a very good theory, but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons.
Number one: Whatever happens, whether you succeed or you fail, people with high expectations always feel better.
Because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month depends on how we interpret that event.
The psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown studied students with high and low expectations.
And they found that when people with high expectations succeed, they attribute that success to their own traits.
"I'm a genius, therefore I got an A, therefore I'll get an A again and again in the future."
When they failed, it wasn't because they were dumb, but because the exam just happened to be unfair.
Next time they will do better.
People with low expectations do the opposite.
So when they failed it was because they were dumb, and when they succeeded it was because the exam just happened to be really easy.
Next time reality would catch up with them.
So they felt worse.
Number two: Regardless of the outcome, the pure act of anticipation makes us happy.
The behavioral economist George Lowenstein asked students in his university to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity, any celebrity.
Then he said, "How much are you willing to pay to get a kiss from a celebrity if the kiss was delivered immediately, in three hours, in 24 hours, in three days, in one year, in 10 years?
He found that the students were willing to pay the most not to get a kiss immediately, but to get a kiss in three days.
They were willing to pay extra in order to wait.
Now they weren't willing to wait a year or 10 years; no one wants an aging celebrity.
But three days seemed to be the optimum amount.
So why is that?
Well if you get the kiss now, it's over and done with.
But if you get the kiss in three days, well that's three days of jittery anticipation, the thrill of the wait.
The students wanted that time to imagine where is it going to happen, how is it going to happen.
Anticipation made them happy.
This is, by the way, why people prefer Friday to Sunday.
It's a really curious fact, because Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure, so you'd assume that people will prefer Sunday, but they don't.
It's not because they really, really like being in the office and they can't stand strolling in the park or having a lazy brunch.
We know that, because when you ask people about their ultimate favorite day of the week, surprise, surprise, Saturday comes in at first, then Friday, then Sunday.
People prefer Friday because Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead, all the plans that you have.
On Sunday, the only thing you can look forward to is the work week.
So optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future, more strolls in the park.
And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing.
In fact, without the optimism bias, we would all be slightly depressed.
People with mild depression, they don't have a bias when they look into the future.
They're actually more realistic than healthy individuals.
But individuals with severe depression, they have a pessimistic bias.
So they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being.
So optimism changes subjective reality.
The way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it.
But it also changes objective reality.
It acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
And that is the third reason why lowering your expectations will not make you happy.
Controlled experiments have shown that optimism is not only related to success, it leads to success.
Optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics.
And maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health.
If we expect the future to be bright, stress and anxiety are reduced.
So all in all, optimism has lots of benefits.
But the question that was really confusing to me was, how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality?
As an neuroscientist, this was especially confusing, because according to all the theories out there, when your expectations are not met, you should alter them.
But this is not what we find.
We asked people to come into our lab in order to try and figure out what was going on.
We asked them to estimate their likelihood of experiencing different terrible events in their lives.
So, for example, what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer?
And then we told them the average likelihood of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes.
So cancer, for example, is about 30 percent.
And then we asked them again, "How likely are you to suffer from cancer?"
What we wanted to know was whether people will take the information that we gave them to change their beliefs.
And indeed they did -- but mostly when the information we gave them was better than what they expected.
So for example, if someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 50 percent," and we said, "Hey, good news.
The average likelihood is only 30 percent," the next time around they would say, "Well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent."
So they learned quickly and efficiently.
But if someone started off saying, "My average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent," and we said, "Hey, bad news.
The average likelihood is about 30 percent," the next time around they would say, "Yep. Still think it's about 11 percent."
So it's not that they didn't learn at all -- they did -- but much, much less than when we gave them positive information about the future.
And it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them; everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer is about 30 percent and the average likelihood of divorce is about 40 percent.
But they didn't think that those numbers were related to them.
What this means is that warning signs such as these may only have limited impact.
Yes, smoking kills, but mostly it kills the other guy.
What I wanted to know was what was going on inside the human brain that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally.
But at the same time, when we hear that the housing market is hopeful, we think, "Oh, my house is definitely going to double in price."
To try and figure that out, I asked the participants in the experiment to lie in a brain imaging scanner.
It looks like this.
And using a method called functional MRI, we were able to identify regions in the brain that were responding to positive information.
One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus.
So if someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer is 50 percent," and we said, "Hey, good news.
Average likelihood is 30 percent," the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely.
And it didn't matter if you're an extreme optimist, a mild optimist or slightly pessimistic, everyone's left inferior frontal gyrus was functioning perfectly well, whether you're Barack Obama or Woody Allen.
On the other side of the brain, the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news.
And here's the thing: it wasn't doing a very good job.
The more optimistic you were, the less likely this region was to respond to unexpected negative information.
And if your brain is failing at integrating bad news about the future, you will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on.
So we wanted to know, could we change this?
Could we alter people's optimism bias by interfering with the brain activity in these regions?
And there's a way for us to do that.
This is my collaborator Ryota Kanai.
And what he's doing is he's passing a small magnetic pulse through the skull of the participant in our study into their inferior frontal gyrus.
And by doing that, he's interfering with the activity of this brain region for about half an hour.
After that everything goes back to normal, I assure you.
So let's see what happens.
First of all, I'm going to show you the average amount of bias that we see.
So if I was to test all of you now, this is the amount that you would learn more from good news relative to bad news.
Now we interfere with the region that we found to integrate negative information in this task, and the optimism bias grew even larger.
We made people more biased in the way that they process information.
Then we interfered with the brain region that we found to integrate good news in this task, and the optimism bias disappeared.
We were quite amazed by these results because we were able to eliminate a deep-rooted bias in humans.
And at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves, would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits?
If we could do that, would we want to take people's optimism bias away?
Well I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias, which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life.
But there are, of course, pitfalls, and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them.
Take for example this email I recieved from a firefighter here in California.
He says, "Fatality investigations for firefighters often include 'We didn't think the fire was going to do that,' even when all of the available information was there to make safe decisions."
This captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias to try to explain to the firefighters why they think the way they do, to make them acutely aware of this very optimistic bias in humans.
So unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior, to financial collapse, to faulty planning.
The British government, for example, has acknowledged that the optimism bias can make individuals more likely to underestimate the costs and durations of projects.
So they have adjusted the 2012 Olympic budget for the optimism bias.
My friend who's getting married in a few weeks has done the same for his wedding budget.
And by the way, when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce, he said he was quite sure it was zero percent.
So what we would really like to do, is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism, but at the same time remain hopeful, benefiting from the many fruits of optimism.
And I believe there's a way for us to do that.
The key here really is knowledge.
We're not born with an innate understanding of our biases.
These have to be identified by scientific investigation.
But the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias does not shatter the illusion.
It's like visual illusions, in which understanding them does not make them go away.
And this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance, to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism, but at the same time remain hopeful.
I think this cartoon portrays it nicely.
Because if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly, you certainly never will.
Because to make any kind of progress, we need to be able to imagine a different reality, and then we need to believe that that reality is possible.
But if you are an extreme optimistic penguin who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best, you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground.
But if you're an optimistic penguin who believes they can fly, but then adjusts a parachute to your back just in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned, you will soar like an eagle, even if you're just a penguin.
Thank you.

<keywords>brain,culture,neuroscience,psychology,science</keywords>

This is the skyline of my hometown, New Orleans.
It was a great place to grow up, but it's one of the most vulnerable spots in the world.
Half the city is already below sea level.
In 2005, the world watched as New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
One thousand, eight hundred and thirty-six people died. Nearly 300,000 homes were lost.
These are my mother's, at the top -- although that's not her car, it was carried there by floodwaters up to the roof -- and that's my sister's, below.
Fortunately, they and other family members got out in time, but they lost their homes, and as you can see, just about everything in them.
Other parts of the world have been hit by storms in even more devastating ways.
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath killed 138,000 in Myanmar.
Climate change is affecting our homes, our communities, our way of life. We should be preparing at every scale and at every opportunity.
This talk is about being prepared for, and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home, the Earth.
The changes in these times won't affect us all equally.
There are important distributional consequences, and they're not what you always might think.
In New Orleans, the elderly and female-headed households were among the most vulnerable.
For those in vulnerable, low-lying nations, how do you put a dollar value on losing your country where you ancestors are buried? And where will your people go?
And how will they cope in a foreign land?
Will there be tensions over immigration, or conflicts over competition for limited resources?
It's already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur.
Like it or not, ready or not, this is our future.
Sure, some are looking for opportunities in this new world.
That's the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice.
But while there might be some short-term individual winners, our collective losses will far outweigh them.
Look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events.
The military gets it. They call climate change a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security, while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond.
So what can we do? How can we prepare and adapt?
I'd like to share three sets of examples, starting with adapting to violent storms and floods.
In New Orleans, the I-10 Twin Spans, with sections knocked out in Katrina, have been rebuilt 21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge.
And these raised and energy-efficient homes were developed by Brad Pitt and Make It Right for the hard-hit Ninth Ward.
The devastated church my mom attends has been not only rebuilt higher, it's poised to become the first Energy Star church in the country.
They're selling electricity back to the grid thanks to solar panels, reflective paint and more.
Their March electricity bill was only 48 dollars.
Now these are examples of New Orleans rebuilding in this way, but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind.
For example, in Galveston, here's a resilient home that survived Hurricane Ike, when others on neighboring lots clearly did not.
And around the world, satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood-prone areas such as Bangladesh.
But as important as technology and infrastructure are, perhaps the human element is even more critical.
We need better planning and systems for evacuation.
We need to better understand how people make decisions in times of crisis, and why.
While it's true that many who died in Katrina did not have access to transportation, others who did refused to leave as the storm approached, often because available transportation and shelters refused to allow them to take their pets.
Imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue.
Fortunately in 2006, Congress passed the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act — it spells "PETS" — to change that.
Second, preparing for heat and drought.
Farmers are facing challenges of drought from Asia to Africa, from Australia to Oklahoma, while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in Western Europe in 2003, and again in Russia in 2010.
In Ethiopia, 70 percent, that's 7-0 percent of the population, depends on rainfall for its livelihood.
Oxfam and Swiss Re, together with Rockefeller Foundation, are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces and find other ways to conserve water, but they're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come.
The stability this provides is giving the farmers the confidence to invest.
It's giving them access to affordable credit.
It's allowing them to become more productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time, without assistance.
It's a virtuous cycle, and one that could be replicated throughout the developing world.
After a lethal 1995 heat wave turned refrigerator trucks from the popular Taste of Chicago festival into makeshift morgues, Chicago became a recognized leader, tamping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cooling centers, outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods, planting trees, creating cool white or vegetated green roofs.
This is City Hall's green roof, next to Cook County's [portion of the] roof, which is 77 degrees Fahrenheit hotter at the surface.
Washington, D.C., last year, actually led the nation in new green roofs installed, and they're funding this in part thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags.
They're splitting the cost of installing these green roofs with home and building owners.
The roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy, and therefore money, the emissions that cause climate change, and they also reduce stormwater runoff.
So some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins.
Third, adapting to rising seas.
Sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems, agriculture, even major cities. This is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the Mekong Delta.
That's where half of Vietnam's rice is grown.
Infrastructure is going to be affected.
Airports around the world are located on the coast.
It makes sense, right? There's open space, the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings.
Here's just one example, San Francisco Airport, with 16 inches or more of flooding.
Imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees.
But there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine. For example, planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated, less dense air, provides for less lift.
San Francisco is also spending 40 million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment, as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater, causing backups at the plant, harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste.
So these outfall pipes have been retrofitted to shut seawater off from entering the system.
Beyond these technical solutions, our work at the Georgetown Climate Center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change.
For example, in land use, which areas do you want to protect, through adding a seawall, for example, alter, by raising buildings, or retreat from, to allow the migration of important natural systems, such as wetlands or beaches?
Other examples to consider. In the U.K., the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surge.
The Asian Cities Climate [Change] Resilience Network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves.
These are not only important ecosystems in their own right, but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities.
New York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms, as you can see from this clever sign, and to sea level rise, and to storm surge, as you can see from the subway flooding.
But back above ground, these raised ventilation grates for the subway system show that solutions can be both functional and attractive. In fact, in New York, San Francisco and London, designers have envisioned ways to better integrate the natural and built environments with climate change in mind.
I think these are inspiring examples of what's possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different.
But now, a word of caution.
Adaptation's too important to be left to the experts.
Why? Well, there are no experts.
We're entering uncharted territory, and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past.
"Stationarity" is the notion that we can anticipate the future based on the past, and plan accordingly, and this principle governs much of our engineering, our design of critical infrastructure, city water systems, building codes, even water rights and other legal precedents.
But we can simply no longer rely on established norms.
We're operating outside the bounds of CO2 concentrations that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years.
The larger point I'm trying to make is this.
It's up to us to look at our homes and our communities, our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk, and to find ways to not just survive, but to thrive, and it's up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same, even while they address the underlying causes of climate change.
There are no quick fixes.
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions.
We're all learning by doing.
But the operative word is doing.
Thank you.

<keywords>cities,climate change,global issues</keywords>

So my name is Amy Webb, and a few years ago I found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion.
And I thought, you know, what's wrong with me?
I don't understand why this keeps happening.
So I asked everybody in my life what they thought.
I turned to my grandmother, who always had plenty of advice, and she said, "Stop being so picky.
You've got to date around.
And most importantly, true love will find you when you least expect it."
Now as it turns out, I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data, as you'll soon find.
I am constantly swimming in numbers and formulas and charts.
I also have a very tight-knit family, and I'm very, very close with my sister, and as a result, I wanted to have the same type of family when I grew up.
So I'm at the end of this bad breakup, I'm 30 years old, I figure I'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months before I'm ready to get monogamous and before we can sort of cohabitate, and we have to have that happen for a while before we can get engaged.
And if I want to start having children by the time I'm 35, that meant that I would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago.
So that wasn't going to work.
If my strategy was to least-expect my way into true love, then the variable that I had to deal with was serendipity.
In short, I was trying to figure out, well, what's the probability of my finding Mr. Right?
Well, at the time I was living in the city of Philadelphia, in this entire place, there are lots of possibilities.
So again, I started doing some math.
Population of Philadelphia: It has 1.5 million people.
I figure about half of that are men, so that takes the number down to 750,000.
I'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36, which was only four percent of the population, so now I'm dealing with the possibility of 30,000 men.
I was looking for somebody who was Jewish, because that's what I am and that was important to me.
That's only 2.3 percent of the population.
I figure I'm attracted to maybe one out of 10 of those men, and there was no way I was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer.
So that basically meant there were 35 men for me that I could possibly date in the entire city of Philadelphia.
In the meantime, my very large Jewish family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children, and I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already.
So if I have two possible strategies at this point I'm sort of figuring out.
One, I can take my grandmother's advice and sort of least-expect my way into maybe bumping into the one out of 35 possible men in the entire 1.5 million-person city of Philadelphia, or I could try online dating.
Now, I like the idea of online dating, because it's predicated on an algorithm, and that's really just a simple way of saying I've got a problem, I'm going to use some data, run it through a system and get to a solution.
So online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other, but as it turns out, algorithms have been around for thousands of years in almost every culture.
In fact, in Judaism, there were matchmakers a long time ago, and though they didn't have an explicit algorithm per se, they definitely were running through formulas in their heads, like, is the girl going to like the boy?
Are the families going to get along?
What's the rabbi going to say?
Are they going to start having children right away?
And the matchmaker would sort of think through all of this, put two people together, and that would be the end of it.
So in my case, I thought, well, will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming?
So I decided to sign on.
Now, there was one small catch.
As I'm signing on to the various dating websites, as it happens, I was really, really busy.
But that actually wasn't the biggest problem.
The biggest problem is that I hate filling out questionnaires of any kind, and I certainly don't like questionnaires that are like Cosmo quizzes.
So I just copied and pasted from my résumé.
So in the descriptive part up top, I said that I was an award-winning journalist and a future thinker.
When I was asked about fun activities and my ideal date, I said monetization and fluency in Japanese.
I talked a lot about JavaScript.
So obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward.
But the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date.
These algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates -- what turned out to be truly awful dates.
There was this guy Steve, the I.T. guy.
The algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets, we share a love of math and data and '80s music, and so I agreed to go out with him.
So Steve the I.T. guy invited me out to one of Philadelphia's white-table-cloth, extremely expensive restaurants.
And we went in, and right off the bat, our conversation really wasn't taking flight, but he was ordering a lot of food.
In fact, he didn't even bother looking at the menu.
He was ordering multiple appetizers, multiple entrées, for me as well, and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table, also lots and lots of bottles of wine.
So we're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner, and I've decided Steve the I.T. guy and I are really just not meant for each other, but we'll part ways as friends, when he gets up to go to the bathroom, and in the meantime the bill comes to our table.
And listen, I'm a modern woman.
I am totally down with splitting the bill.
But then Steve the I.T. guy didn't come back.
And that was my entire month's rent.
So needless to say, I was not having a good night.
So I run home, I call my mother, I call my sister, and as I do, at the end of each one of these terrible, terrible dates, I regale them with the details.
And they say to me, "Stop complaining."
"You're just being too picky."
So I said, fine, from here on out I'm only going on dates where I know that there's wi-fi, and I'm bringing my laptop.
I'm going to shove it into my bag, and I'm going to have this email template, and I'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically, these dates really are terrible.
So I started tracking things like really stupid, awkward, sexual remarks; bad vocabulary; the number of times a man forced me to high-five him.
So I started to crunch some numbers, and that allowed me to make some correlations.
So as it turns out, for some reason, men who drink Scotch reference kinky sex immediately.
Well, it turns out that these probably weren't bad guys.
There were just bad for me.
And as it happens, the algorithms that were setting us up, they weren't bad either.
These algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do, which was to take our user-generated information, in my case, my résumé, and match it up with other people's information.
See, the real problem here is that, while the algorithms work just fine, you and I don't, when confronted with blank windows where we're supposed to input our information online.
Very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves.
The other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like, are you a dog person or a cat person?
Do you like horror films or romance films?
I'm not looking for a pen pal.
I'm looking for a husband. Right?
So there's a certain amount of superficiality in that data.
So I said fine, I've got a new plan.
I'm going to keep using these online dating sites, but I'm going to treat them as databases, and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up, I think I'm going to try reverse-engineering this entire system.
So knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people, I decided instead to ask my own questions.
What was every single possible thing that I could think of that I was looking for in a mate?
So I started writing and writing and writing, and at the end, I had amassed 72 different data points.
I wanted somebody was Jew...ish, so I was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture, but wasn't going to force me to go to shul every Friday and Saturday.
I wanted somebody who worked hard, because work for me is extremely important, but not too hard.
For me, the hobbies that I have are really just new work projects that I've launched.
I also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children, but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that I do, so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three, and also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it.
So things like that, but I also wanted somebody who would go to far-flung, exotic places, like Petra, Jordan.
I also wanted somebody who would weigh 20 pounds more than me at all times, regardless of what I weighed.
So I now have these 72 different data points, which, to be fair, is a lot.
So what I did was, I went through and I prioritized that list.
I broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points, and I ranked everything starting at 100 and going all the way down to 91, and listing things like I was looking for somebody who was really smart, who would challenge and stimulate me, and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points.
These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers.
So once I had all this done, I then built a scoring system, because what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not I thought the guy that I found online I figured there would be a minimum of 700 points before I would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message.
For 900 points, I'd agree to go out on a date, and I wouldn't even consider any kind of relationship before somebody had crossed the 1,500 point threshold.
Well, as it turns out, this worked pretty well.
So I go back online now.
I found Jewishdoc57 who's incredibly good-looking, incredibly well-spoken, he had hiked Mt. Fuji, he had walked along the Great Wall.
He likes to travel as long as it doesn't involve a cruise ship.
And I thought, I've done it!
I've cracked the code.
I have just found the Jewish Prince Charming of my family's dreams.
There was only one problem: He didn't like me back.
And I guess the one variable that I haven't considered is the competition.
Who are all of the other women on these dating sites?
I found SmileyGirl1978.
She said she was a "fun girl who is Happy and Outgoing."
She listed her job as teacher.
She said she is "silly, nice and friendly."
She likes to make people laugh "alot."
At this moment I knew, clicking after profile after profile after profile that looked like this, that I needed to do some market research.
So I created 10 fake male profiles.
Now, before I lose all of you -- -- understand that I did this strictly to gather data about everybody else in the system.
I didn't carry on crazy Catfish-style relationships with anybody.
I really was just scraping their data.
But I didn't want everybody's data.
I only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that I really, really wanted to marry.
When I released these men into the wild, I did follow some rules.
So I didn't reach out to any woman first.
I just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract, and mainly what I was looking at was two different data sets.
So I was looking at qualitative data, so what was the humor, the tone, the voice, the communication style that these women shared in common?
And also quantitative data, so what was the average length of their profile, how much time was spent between messages?
that I figured in person, as a SmileyGirl1978.
I wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online.
Well, one month later, I had a lot of data, and I was able to do another analysis.
And as it turns out, content matters a lot.
So smart people tend to write a lot -- 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 words about themselves, which may all be very, very interesting.
The challenge here, though, is that the popular men and women are sticking to 97 words on average that are written very, very well, even though it may not seem like it all the time.
The other sort of hallmark of the people who do this well is that they're using non-specific language.
So in my case, you know, "The English Patient" is my most favorite movie ever, but it doesn't work to use that in a profile, because that's a superficial data point, and somebody may disagree with me and decide they don't want to go out with me because they didn't like sitting through the three-hour movie.
Also, optimistic language matters a lot.
So this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women, words like "fun" and "girl" and "love."
And what I realized was not that I had to dumb down my own profile.
Remember, I'm somebody who said that I speak fluent Japanese and I know JavaScript and I was okay with that.
The difference is that it's about being more approachable and helping people understand the best way to reach out to you.
And as it turns out, timing is also really, really important.
Just because you have access to somebody's mobile phone number or their instant message account and it's 2 o'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake, doesn't mean that that's a good time to communicate with those people.
The popular women on these online sites spend an average of 23 hours in between each communication.
And that's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship.
And finally, there were the photos.
All of the women who were popular showed some skin.
They all looked really great, which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what I had uploaded.
Once I had all of this information, I was able to create a super profile, so it was still me, but it was me optimized now for this ecosystem.
And as it turns out, I did a really good job.
I was the most popular person online.
And as it turns out, lots and lots of men wanted to date me.
So I call my mom, I call my sister, I call my grandmother.
I'm telling them about this fabulous news, and they say, "This is wonderful!
How soon are you going out?"
And I said, "Well, actually, I'm not going to go out with anybody."
Because remember, in my scoring system, they have to reach a minimum threshold of 700 points, and none of them have done that.
They said, "What? You're still being too damn picky."
Well, not too long after that, I found this guy, Thevenin, and he said that he was culturally Jewish, he said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter, which I thought was very clever.
He talked in detail about travel.
He made a lot of really interesting cultural references.
He looked and talked exactly like what I wanted, and immediately, he scored 850 points.
It was enough for a date.
Three weeks later, we met up in person for what turned out to be a 14-hour-long conversation that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant, and when he dropped me back off at my house that night I re-scored him -- [1,050 points!] -- thought, you know what, this entire time I haven't been picky enough.
Well, a year and a half after that, we were non-cruise ship traveling through Petra, Jordan, when he got down on his knee and proposed.
A year after that, we were married, and about a year and a half after that, our daughter, Petra, was born.
Obviously, I'm having a fabulous life, so -- -- the question is, what does all of this mean for you?
Well, as it turns out, there is an algorithm for love.
It's just not the ones that we're being presented with online.
In fact, it's something that you write yourself.
So whether you're looking for a husband or a wife or you're trying to find your passion or you're trying to start a business, all you have to really do is figure out your own framework and play by your own rules, and feel free to be as picky as you want.
Well, on my wedding day, I had a conversation again with my grandmother, and she said, "All right, maybe I was wrong.
It looks like you did come up with a really, really great system.
Now, your matzoh balls.
They should be fluffy, not hard."
And I'll take her advice on that.

I'm a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist, I'm actually interested in how the brain learns, and I'm especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter, better and faster.
This is in this context I'm going to tell you about video games. When we say video games, most of you think about children.
It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.
But let's be frank.
When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?
Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old, not eight years old, and in fact, if we look at the projected demographics of video game play, the video game players of tomorrow are older adults.
So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.
It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact on our everyday life. Consider these statistics released by Activision. After one month of release of the game "Call Of Duty: Black Ops," it had been played for 68,000 years worldwide, right?
Would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra?
So what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power?
Now I want to step back a bit.
I know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games.
The name of the game is to get after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you, right?
And I'm almost sure most of you have thought, "Oh, come on, can't you do something more intelligent than shooting at zombies?"
I'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right?
Most parents would find that great.
Well, I'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health.
It's not, and binging is never good.
But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses, actually the very game I showed you at the beginning, those action-packed shooter games have quite powerful effects and positive effects on many different aspects of our behavior.
There's not one week that goes without some major headlines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you, right? You're all bombarded with that.
I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab.
What we do in the lab is actually measure directly, in a quantitative fashion, what is the impact of video games on the brain.
And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work.
One first saying that I'm sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse.
That's a statement about vision.
There may be vision scientists among you.
We actually know how to test that statement.
We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.
Well, guess what? People that don't play a lot of action games, that don't actually spend a lot of time in front of screens, have normal, or what we call corrective-to-normal vision. That's okay.
The issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week, 10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.
By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?
Guess what? Their vision is really, really good.
It's better than those that don't play.
And it's better in two different ways.
The first way is that they're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter, and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it with just your eyesight.
The other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray.
Imagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident.
So we're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision, and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better.
Clearly, when it comes to action video games, screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse.
Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around: Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.
Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.
I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so.
I'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink.
Right? So this is the first example.
["Chair"] Orange, good. ["Table"] Green.
["Board"] Audience: Red.Daphne Bavelier: Red.
["Horse"] DB: Yellow. Audience: Yellow.
["Yellow"] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow.
["Blue"] DB: Yellow.
Okay, you get my point, right?
You're getting better, but it's hard. Why is it hard?
Because I introduced a conflict between the word itself and its color.
How good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict, so the young guys here at the top of their game probably, like, did a little better than some of us that are older.
What we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games, they actually resolve the conflict faster.
So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead to attention problems.
Actually, those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention, and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world.
This is something we use all the time. When you're driving, you're tracking, keeping track of the cars around you.
You're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog, and that's how you can actually be safe driving, right?
In the lab, we get people to come to the lab, sit in front of a computer screen, and we give them little tasks that I'm going to get you to do again.
You're going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces. These are children in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess during the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess.
But a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat.
Everybody begins to move around, and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes. You can track, you can track, and then when it stops, and there is a question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not?
Was it yellow initially or blue?
I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain.
I'm now going to ask you to do the task, but now with a little more challenging task. There are going to be three of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes.
Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated and expand, pull your attention. That's the only way you can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you're doomed.
Yellow or blue?
Audience: Yellow.DB: Good.
So your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention.
That's what we just did. Your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention, which is what is shown in this video here.
That's for you guys, action video game players.
A bit more challenging, right?
Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some people that are serious out there. Yeah.
Good. So in the same way that we actually see the effects of video games on people's behavior, we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain, and we do find many changes, but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention.
The other one is the frontal lobe, which controls how we sustain attention, and another one is the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict.
Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games.
This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain.
You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty of multitasking when you're driving and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea.
Why? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone, you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you, and so you're much more likely to get engaged into a car accident.
Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.
We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have. That would be a little costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy, how good they are at switching from one task to another.
When we do that, we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really, really good.
They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.
Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it in the context of another group of technology users, a group which is actually much revered by society, which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.
What is multimedia-tasking? It's the fact that most of us, most of our children, are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they're doing search on the web at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends.
That's a multimedia-tasker.
There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford and that we replicated that showed that those people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers are absolutely abysmal at multitasking.
When we measure them in the lab, they're really bad.
Right? So these kinds of results really makes two main points.
The first one is that not all media are created equal.
You can't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking and the effect of playing action games. They have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition, perception and attention.
Even within video games, I'm telling you right now about these action-packed video games.
Different video games have a different effect on your brains.
So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game.
The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.
I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers have a lot of very good vision, etc.
Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high multimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.
So you show them their data, you show them they are bad and they're like, "Not possible." You know, they have this sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.
That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain.
Now in a sense, when we think about the effect of video games on the brain, it's very similar to the effect of wine on the health.
There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some very poor uses of video games. But when consumed in reasonable doses, and at the right age, wine can be very good for health. There are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.
So it's the same way, like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention, vision, etc., and so we need and we're working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games, either for education or for rehabilitation of patients.
Now because we are interested in having an impact for education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform.
I'm much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game, I can actually change your vision for the better, whether you want to play that action game or not, right?
That's the point of rehabilitation or education.
Most of the kids don't go to school saying, "Great, two hours of math!"
So that's really the crux of the research, and to do that, we need to go one more step.
And one more step is to do training studies.
So let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation.
Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you, and again you're going to do the task, to look at this shape. Study it, it's a target shape, and I'm going to present to you four different shapes.
One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape. I want you to tell me which one: the first one, second one, third one or fourth one?
Okay, I'll help you. Fourth one.
One more. Get those brains working. Come on.
That's our target shape.
Third. Good! This is hard, right?
Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing, right?
It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games.
Well, what we do in these training studies is, people come to the lab, they do tasks like this one, we then force them to play 10 hours of action games.
They don't play 10 hours of action games in a row.
They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks.
Then, once they are done with the training, they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague in Toronto. What they showed is that, initially, you know, subjects perform where they are expected to perform given their age. After two weeks of training on action video games, they actually perform better, and the improvement is still there five months after having done the training. That's really, really important.
Why? Because I told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects that are going to be long-lasting.
Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy, or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?
Well, we're working on it, but here is a challenge.
There are brain scientists like me that are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to promote positive effects, and that's what I'm going to call the broccoli side of the equation.
There is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can't resist.
That's the chocolate side of the equation.
The issue is we need to put the two together, and it's a little bit like with food.
Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?
None of you. And you probably have had that feeling, right, picking up an education game and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun, it's not really engaging. So what we need is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate that is irresistible, that you really want to play, but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize but are still working on your brains. And we're working on it, but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together, people that work in the entertainment software industry, and publishers, so these are not people that usually meet every day, but it's actually doable, and we are on the right track.
I'd like to leave you with that thought, and thank you for your attention.

There's a group of people in Kenya.
People cross oceans to go see them.
These people are tall.
They jump high. They wear red.
And they kill lions.
You might be wondering, who are these people?
These are the Maasais.
And you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them.
The Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors.
The girls are brought up to be mothers.
When I was five years old, I found out that I was engaged to be married as soon as I reached puberty.
My mother, my grandmother, my aunties, they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by.
Cool, yeah?
And everything I had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12.
My day started at 5 in the morning, milking the cows, sweeping the house, cooking for my siblings, collecting water, firewood.
I did everything that I needed to do to become a perfect wife.
I went to school not because the Maasais' women or girls were going to school.
It's because my mother was denied an education, and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living.
Why did she say that?
My father worked as a policeman in the city.
He came home once a year.
We didn't see him for sometimes even two years.
And whenever he came home, it was a different case.
My mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat.
She reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us.
But when my father came, he would sell the cows, he would sell the products we had, and he went and drank with his friends in the bars.
Because my mother was a woman, she was not allowed to own any property, and by default, everything in my family anyway belongs to my father, so he had the right.
And if my mother ever questioned him, he beat her, abused her, and really it was difficult.
When I went to school, I had a dream.
I wanted to become a teacher.
Teachers looked nice.
They wear nice dresses, high-heeled shoes.
I found out later that they are uncomfortable, but I admired it.
But most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board -- not hard work, that's what I thought, compared to what I was doing in the farm.
So I wanted to become a teacher.
I worked hard in school, but when I was in eighth grade, it was a determining factor.
In our tradition, there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women, and it's a rite of passage to womanhood.
And then I was just finishing my eighth grade, and that was a transition for me to go to high school.
This was the crossroad.
Once I go through this tradition, I was going to become a wife.
Well, my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass.
So I talked -- I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out.
I talked to my father. I did something that most girls have never done.
I told my father, "I will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school."
The reason why, if I ran away, my father will have a stigma, people will be calling him the father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony.
It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life.
So he figured out. "Well," he said, "okay, you'll go to school after the ceremony."
I did. The ceremony happened.
It's a whole week long of excitement.
It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it.
And the day before the actual ceremony happens, we were dancing, having excitement, and through all the night we did not sleep.
The actual day came, and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in. Yes, we danced and danced.
We walked out to the courtyard, and there were a bunch of people waiting.
They were all in a circle.
And as we danced and danced, and we approached this circle of women, men, women, children, everybody was there.
There was a woman sitting in the middle of it, and this woman was waiting to hold us.
I was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls, and as I approached her, she looked at me, and I sat down.
And I sat down, and I opened my legs.
As I opened my leg, another woman came, and this woman was carrying a knife.
And as she carried the knife, she walked toward me and she held the clitoris, and she cut it off.
As you can imagine, I bled. I bled.
After bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.
It's something that so many girls -- I'm lucky, I never died -- but many die.
It's practiced, it's no anesthesia, it's a rusty old knife, and it was difficult.
I was lucky because one, also, my mom did something that most women don't do.
Three days later, after everybody has left the home, my mom went and brought a nurse.
We were taken care of.
Three weeks later, I was healed, and I was back in high school.
I was so determined to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family.
Well, while I was in high school, something happened.
I met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the University of Oregon.
This man was wearing a white t-shirt, jeans, camera, white sneakers -- and I'm talking about white sneakers.
There is something about clothes, I think, and shoes.
They were sneakers, and this is in a village that doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive.
I told him, "Well, I want to go to where you are," because this man looked very happy, and I admired that.
And he told me, "Well, what do you mean, you want to go?
Don't you have a husband waiting for you?"
And I told him, "Don't worry about that part.
Just tell me how to get there."
This gentleman, he helped me.
While I was in high school also, my dad was sick.
He got a stroke, and he was really, really sick, so he really couldn't tell me what to do next.
But the problem is, my father is not the only father I have.
Everybody who is my dad's age, male in the community, is my father by default -- my uncles, all of them -- and they dictate what my future is.
So the news came, I applied to school and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, and I couldn't come without the support of the village, because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket.
I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here.
But I needed the support of the village, and here again, when the men heard, and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school, they said, "What a lost opportunity.
This should have been given to a boy. We can't do this."
So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition.
There's a belief among our people that morning brings good news.
So I had to come up with something to do with the morning, because there's good news in the morning.
And in the village also, there is one chief, an elder, who if he says yes, everybody will follow him.
So I went to him very early in the morning, as the sun rose.
The first thing he sees when he opens his door is, it's me.
"My child, what are you doing here?"
"Well, Dad, I need help. Can you support me to go to America?"
I promised him that I would be the best girl, I will come back, anything they wanted after that, I will do it for them.
He said, "Well, but I can't do it alone."
He gave me a list of another 15 men that I went -- 16 more men -- every single morning I went and visited them.
They all came together.
The village, the women, the men, everybody came together to support me to come to get an education.
I arrived in America. As you can imagine, what did I find?
I found snow!
I found Wal-Marts, vacuum cleaners, and lots of food in the cafeteria.
I was in a land of plenty.
I enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here, I discovered a lot of things.
I learned that that ceremony that I went through when I was 13 years old, it was called female genital mutilation.
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya.
I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education. I had a right.
And as we speak right now, three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation.
I learned that my mom had a right to own property.
I learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman.
Those things made me angry.
I wanted to do something.
As I went back, every time I went, I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married.
They were getting mutilated, and here, after I graduated from here, I worked at the U.N., I went back to school to get my graduate work, the constant cry of these girls was in my face.
I had to do something.
As I went back, I started talking to the men, to the village, and mothers, and I said, "I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you. What do you need?"
As I spoke to the women, they told me, "You know what we need? We really need a school for girls."
Because there had not been any school for girls.
And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school, the mother is blamed for that.
If she got pregnant before she got married, the mother is blamed for that, and she's punished.
She's beaten.
They said, "We wanted to put our girls in a safe place."
As we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers, the fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said: "We want a school for boys."
And I said, "Well, there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education.
Why can't they build a school for boys, and I'll build a school for girls?"
That made sense. And they agreed.
And I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.
And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school.
We have.
I want you to meet one of the girls in that school.
Angeline came to apply for the school, and she did not meet any criteria that we had.
She's an orphan. Yes, we could have taken her for that.
But she was older. She was 12 years old, and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade.
Angeline had been moving from one place -- because she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father -- moving from one grandmother's house to another one, from aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life.
And I looked at her, I remember that day, and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline.
And yes, she was older to be in fourth grade.
We gave her the opportunity to come to the class.
Five months later, that is Angeline.
A transformation had begun in her life.
Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world and make a difference.
She was not the top student when we took her.
Now she's the best student, not just in our school, but in the entire division that we are in.
That's Sharon. That's five years later.
That's Evelyn. Five months later, that is the difference that we are making.
As a new dawn is happening in my school, a new beginning is happening.
As we speak right now, 125 girls will never be mutilated.
One hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they're 12 years old.
One hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams.
This is the thing that we are doing, giving them opportunities where they can rise.
As we speak right now, women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we've started in our community.
I want to challenge you today.
You are listening to me because you are here, very optimistic.
You are somebody who is so passionate.
You are somebody who wants to see a better world.
You are somebody who wants to see that war ends, no poverty.
You are somebody who wants to make a difference.
You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better.
I want to challenge you today that to be the first, because people will follow you.
Be the first. People will follow you.
Be bold. Stand up. Be fearless. Be confident.
Move out, because as you change your world, as you change your community, as we believe that we are impacting one girl, one family, one village, one country at a time.
We are making a difference, so if you change your world, you are going to change your community, you are going to change your country, and think about that. If you do that, and I do that, aren't we going to create a better future for our children, for your children, for our grandchildren?
And we will live in a very peaceful world. Thank you very much.

Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration and thank you, and having it be specific and genuine.
And the way I got interested in this was, I noticed in myself, when I was growing up, and until about a few years ago, that I would want to say thank you to someone, I would want to praise them, I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it.
And I asked myself, why?
I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.
And then my question became, am I the only one who does this?
So, I decided to investigate.
I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility, so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as, their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.
But then, they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him, but he never told the son.
It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it.
So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need?
I know a gentleman, married for 25 years, who's longing to hear his wife say, "Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids," but won't ask.
I know a woman who's good at this.
She, once a week, meets with her husband and says, "I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids."
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."
And praise really does have to be genuine, but she takes responsibility for that.
And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten, she thanks her children for doing their chores.
And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"
So, the question is, why was I blocking it?
Why were other people blocking it?
Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare, I need size six shoes," but I won't say, "Would you praise me this way?"
And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.
I'm telling you where I'm insecure.
I'm telling you where I need your help.
And I'm treating you, my inner circle, like you're the enemy.
Because what can you do with that data?
You could neglect me.
You could abuse it.
Or you could actually meet my need.
And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this -- same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.
The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much better."
I get the same bike back, and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new.
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.
I want you to true your wheels: be honest about the praise that you need to hear.
What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife -- go ask her, what does she need?
Go home to your husband -- what does he need?
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.
And it's simple.
And why should we care about this?
We talk about world peace.
How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?
I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.
So, let's make it right in our own backyard.
And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands, great mothers, friends, daughters, sons.
And maybe somebody's never said that to you, but you've done a really, really good job.
And thank you for being here, just showing up and changing the world with your ideas.
Thank you.

I'm a storyteller.
That's what I do in life -- telling stories, writing novels -- and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni.
But before I go there, please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story.
I will do so with the help of words, of course, but also a geometrical shape, the circle, so throughout my talk, you will come across several circles.
I was born in Strasbourg, France to Turkish parents.
Shortly after, my parents got separated, and I came to Turkey with my mom.
From then on, I was raised as a single child by a single mother.
Now in the early 1970s, in Ankara, that was a bit unusual.
Our neighborhood was full of large families, where fathers were the heads of households, so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment.
In fact, I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood.
On the one hand was my mother, a well-educated, secular, modern, westernized, Turkish woman.
On the other hand was my grandmother, who also took care of me and was more spiritual, less educated and definitely less rational.
This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye.
Many people visited my grandmother, people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands.
Each time, my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic, take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove.
Then one by one, she would encircle these thorns with dark ink.
A week later, the patient would come back for a follow-up examination.
Now, I'm aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists, but the truth is, of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions, I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed.
I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying?
In response she said, "Yes, praying is effective, but also beware of the power of circles."
From her, I learned, amongst many other things, one very precious lesson -- that if you want to destroy something in this life, be it an acne, a blemish or the human soul, all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls.
It will dry up inside.
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle.
We all do.
We're born into a certain family, nation, class.
But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted, then we too run the risk of drying up inside.
Our imagination might shrink; our hearts might dwindle, and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons.
Our friends, neighbors, colleagues, family -- if all the people in our inner circle resemble us, it means we are surrounded with our mirror image.
Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out.
It's an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection.
Ironically, [living in] communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today's globalized world.
And it's happening everywhere, among liberals and conservatives, agnostics and believers, the rich and the poor, East and West alike.
We tend to form clusters based on similarity, and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people.
In my opinion, one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling.
Stories cannot demolish frontiers, but they can punch holes in our mental walls.
And through those holes, we can get a glimpse of the other, and sometimes even like what we see.
I started writing fiction at the age of eight.
My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal.
In retrospect, I think she was slightly worried about my sanity.
I was constantly telling stories at home, which was good, except I told this to imaginary friends around me, which was not so good.
I was an introverted child, to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them, so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions.
What she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring, and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself.
Instead, I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened.
And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction.
So from the very beginning, fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives, other possibilities.
And please bear with me: I'll draw a circle and come back to this point.
Now one other thing happened around this same time.
My mother became a diplomat.
So from this small, superstitious, middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother, I was zoomed into this posh, international school [in Madrid], where I was the only Turk.
It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the "representative foreigner."
In our classroom, there were children from all nationalities, yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan, egalitarian classroom democracy.
Instead, it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen -- not as an individual on his own, but as the representative of something larger.
We were like a miniature United Nations, which was fun, except whenever something negative, with regards to a nation or a religion, took place.
The child who represented it was mocked, ridiculed and bullied endlessly.
And I should know, because during the time I attended that school, a military takeover happened in my country, a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope, and Turkey got zero points in [the] Eurovision Song Contest.
I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days.
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there.
The other children asked me about the movie "Midnight Express," which I had not seen; they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked, because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers, and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair.
I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country: politics, cigarettes and the veil.
After Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany and Ankara again.
Everywhere I went, I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me.
Stories gave me a sense of center, continuity and coherence, the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked.
In my mid-twenties, I moved to Istanbul, the city I adore.
I lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels.
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999.
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning, I saw something that stopped me in my tracks.
There was the local grocer there -- a grumpy, old man who didn't sell alcohol and didn't speak to marginals.
He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks.
I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her, and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today -- a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk.
In the face of death and destruction, our mundane differences evaporated, and we all became one even if for a few hours.
But I've always believed that stories, too, have a similar effect on us.
I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake, but when we are reading a good novel, we leave our small, cozy apartments behind, go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against.
Shortly after, I went to a women's college in Boston, then Michigan.
I experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift, as a linguistic one.
I started writing fiction in English.
I'm not an immigrant, refugee or exile -- they ask me why I do this -- but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself.
I love writing in Turkish, which to me is very poetic and very emotional, and I love writing in English, which to me is very mathematical and cerebral.
So I feel connected to each language in a different way.
For me, like millions of other people around the world today, English is an acquired language.
When you're a latecomer to a language, what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration.
As latecomers, we always want to say more, you know, crack better jokes, say better things, but we end up saying less because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue.
And that gap is very intimidating.
But if we manage not to be frightened by it, it's also stimulating.
And this is what I discovered in Boston -- that frustration was very stimulating.
At this stage, my grandmother, who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety, started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all.
And because God loves her, I did get married.
But instead of settling down, I went to Arizona.
And since my husband is in Istanbul, I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul -- the two places on the surface of earth that couldn't be more different.
I guess one part of me has always been a nomad, physically and spiritually.
Stories accompany me, keeping my pieces and memories together, like an existential glue.
Yet as much as I love stories, recently, I've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story.
And this is a subject that I would love to think about together.
When my first novel written in English came out in America, I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.
"I liked your book," he said, "but I wish you had written it differently."
I asked him what he meant by that.
He said, "Well, look at it. There's so many Spanish, American, Hispanic characters in it, but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man."
Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston, so to me, it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters, but I understood what my critic was looking for.
And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him.
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity.
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one.
We often talk about how stories change the world, but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated, read and reviewed.
Many authors feel this pressure, but non-Western authors feel it more heavily.
If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world, like me, then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and, preferably, the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women.
You're expected to write informative, poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your Western colleagues.
What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today.
Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own, but as the representatives of their respective cultures: a few authors from China, a few from Turkey, a few from Nigeria.
We're all thought to have something very distinctive, if not peculiar.
The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality.
When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer, Baldwin stopped and said, "But don't you see? There's nothing in me that is not in everybody else, and nothing in everybody else that is not in me."
When identity politics tries to put labels on us, it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger.
There's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together.
I never forget my first multicultural reading, in Harvard Square about 10 years ago.
We were three writers, one from the Philippines, one Turkish and one Indonesian -- like a joke, you know.
And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste.
It was only because of our passports.
Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories, not so much the imaginary.
A function is attributed to fiction.
In this way, not only the writers themselves, but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger.
But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West.
It comes from everywhere.
And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel.
I had intended to write a constructive, multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women.
My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted.
Some people criticized, others praised me for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict.
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction.
It was just a story.
And when I say, "just a story," I'm not trying to belittle my work.
I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is, not as a means to an end.
Writers are entitled to their political opinions, and there are good political novels out there, but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics.
Chekhov said, "The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things.
And only the latter is an artist's responsibility."
Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects.
One is interested in sweeping generalizations.
The other, in nuances.
One draws boundaries.
The other recognizes no frontiers.
Identity politics is made of solid bricks.
Fiction is flowing water.
In the Ottoman times, there were itinerant storytellers called "meddah."
They would go to coffee houses, where they would tell a story in front of an audience, often improvising.
With each new person in the story, the meddah would change his voice, impersonating that character.
Everybody could go and listen, you know -- ordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims and non-Muslims.
Stories cut across all boundaries, like "The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja," which were very popular throughout the Middle East, North Africa, the Balkans and Asia.
Today, stories continue to transcend borders.
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk, they usually don't listen to each other, but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author, and vice versa, connecting and empathizing with the narrator.
Literature has to take us beyond.
If it cannot take us there, it is not good literature.
Books have saved the introverted, timid child that I was -- that I once was.
But I'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them.
When the poet and mystic, Rumi, met his spiritual companion, Shams of Tabriz, one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi's books into water and watch the letters dissolve.
The Sufis say, "Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance."
The problem with today's cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge -- we know a lot about each other, or so we think -- but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves: it makes us elitist, distant and disconnected.
There's a metaphor which I love: living like a drawing compass.
As you know, one leg of the compass is static, rooted in a place.
Meanwhile, the other leg draws a wide circle, constantly moving.
Like that, my fiction as well.
One part of it is rooted in Istanbul, with strong Turkish roots, but the other part travels the world, connecting to different cultures.
In that sense, I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal, both from here and everywhere.
Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace, which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than 400 years.
In the palace, just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines, there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn.
It's between buildings.
I'm intrigued by this concept.
We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things.
We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn, who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness.
But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most.
When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability.
I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later.
I like it when my characters surprise me.
I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel, and perhaps it will be a very happy story, and in my next book, I might write about a handsome, gay professor in Norway.
As long as it comes from our hearts, we can write about anything and everything.
Audre Lorde once said, "The white fathers taught us to say, 'I think, therefore I am.'" She suggested, "I feel, therefore I am free."
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift.
And yet, why is it that, in creative writing courses today, the very first thing we teach students is "write what you know"?
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all.
Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about.
We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel.
We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next.
In the end, stories move like whirling dervishes, drawing circles beyond circles.
They connect all humanity, regardless of identity politics, and that is the good news.
And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem: "Come, let us be friends for once; let us make life easy on us; let us be lovers and loved ones; the earth shall be left to no one."
Thank you.

<title>Elif Shafak: The politics of fiction</title>
<description>Listening to stories widens the imagination; telling them lets us leap over cultural walls, embrace different experiences, feel what others feel. Elif Shafak builds on this simple idea to argue that fiction can overcome identity politics.</description>

We're going to begin in 1964.
Bob Dylan is 23 years old, and his career is just reaching its pinnacle.
He's been christened the voice of a generation, and he's churning out classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate, but there's a small minority of dissenters, and they claim that Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs.
2004. Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, takes the Beatles' "White Album," combines it with Jay-Z's "The Black Album" to create "The Grey Album."
"The Grey Album" becomes an immediate sensation online, and the Beatles' record company sends out countless cease-and-desist letters for "unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property."
Now, "The Grey Album" is a remix.
It is new media created from old media.
It was made using these three techniques: copy, transform and combine.
It's how you remix. You take existing songs, you chop them up, you transform the pieces, you combine them back together again, and you've got a new song, but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs.
But I think these aren't just the components of remixing.
I think these are the basic elements of all creativity.
I think everything is a remix, and I think this is a better way to conceive of creativity.
All right, let's head back to 1964, and let's hear where some of Dylan's early songs came from.
We'll do some side-by-side comparisons here.
All right, this first song you're going to hear is "Nottamun Town." It's a traditional folk tune.
After that, you'll hear Dylan's "Masters of War."
Jean Ritchie: In Nottamun Town, not a soul would look out, not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down. Bob Dylan: Come you masters of war, you that build the big guns, you that build the death planes, You that build all the bombs. Kirby Ferguson: Okay, so that's the same basic melody and overall structure. This next one is "The Patriot Game," by Dominic Behan. Alongside that, you're going to hear "With God on Our Side," by Dylan.
Dominic Behan: Come all ye young rebels, and list while I sing, for the love of one's land is a terrible thing. BD: Oh my name it is nothin', my age it means less, the country I come from is called the Midwest. Okay, so in this case, Dylan admits he must have heard "The Patriot Game," he forgot about it, then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain, he just thought it was his song.
Last one, this is "Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons," another traditional folk tune.
Alongside that is "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right."
This one's more about the lyric.
Paul Clayton: It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, darlin', and it ain't no use to sit and cry now. BD: It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe, if you don't know by now, and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe, it'll never do somehow. Okay, now, there's a lot of these.
It's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed.
This is pretty typical among folk singers.
Here's the advice of Dylan's idol, Woody Guthrie.
"The worlds are the important thing.
Don't worry about tunes. Take a tune, sing high when they sing low, sing fast when they sing slow, and you've got a new tune."
And that's, that's what Guthrie did right here, and I'm sure you all recognize the results.
We know this tune, right? We know it?
Actually you don't.
That is "When the World's on Fire," a very old melody, in this case performed by the Carter Family.
Guthrie adapted it into "This Land Is Your Land."
So, Bob Dylan, like all folk singers, he copied melodies, he transformed them, he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff.
Now, American copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others.
Instead, these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property.
Now, creative works may indeed be kind of like property, but it's property that we're all building on, and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared.
Henry Ford once said, "I invented nothing new.
I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work.
Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable."
2007. The iPhone makes it debut.
Apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early, but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades.
That's multi-touch, controlling a device by touching its display.
Here is Steve Jobs introducing multi-touch and making a rather foreboding joke.
Steve Jobs: And we have invented a new technology called multi-touch.
You can do multi-fingered gestures on it, and boy have we patented it.
Yes. And yet, here is multi-touch in action.
This is at TED, actually, about a year earlier.
This is Jeff Han, and, I mean, that's multi-touch.
It's the same animal, at least.
Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this newfangled technology.
Jeff Han: Multi-touch sensing isn't anything -- isn't completely new. I mean, people like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s.
The technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility.
So he's pretty frank about it not being new.
So it's not multi-touch as a whole that's patented.
It's the small parts of it that are, and it's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent: to promote the progress of useful arts.
Here is the first ever slide-to-unlock.
That is all there is to it. Apple has patented this.
It's a 28-page software patent, but I will summarize what it covers. Spoiler alert: Unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger.
I'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent.
Now, can someone own this idea?
Now, back in the '80s, there were no software patents, and it was Xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface.
What if they had patented pop-up menus, scrollbars, the desktop with icons that look like folders and sheets of paper?
Would a young and inexperienced Apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like Xerox?
Now, this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you're the one getting remixed.
For example ...
SJ: I mean, Picasso had a saying.
He said, "Good artists copy. Great artists steal."
And we have, you know, always been shameless about stealing great ideas.
Okay, so that's in '96. Here's in 2010.
"I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product."
"I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this."
Okay, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.
Now, behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion We have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours.
We have no such aversion towards copying what other people have, because we do that nonstop.
So here's the sort of equation we're looking at.
We've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property, plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases, plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court, plus cognitive biases against perceived loss.
And the sum looks like this.
That is the last four years of lawsuits in the realm of smartphones.
Is this promoting the progress of useful arts?
1983. Bob Dylan is 42 years old, and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past.
He records a song called "Blind Willie McTell," named after the blues singer, and the song is a voyage through the past, through a much darker time, but a simpler one, a time when musicians like Willie McTell had few illusions about what they did.
"I jump 'em from other writers but I arrange 'em my own way."
I think this is mostly what we do.
Our creativity comes from without, not from within.
We are not self-made. We are dependent on one another, and admitting this to ourselves isn't an embrace of mediocrity and derivativeness.
It's a liberation from our misconceptions, and it's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin.
Thank you so much. It was an honor to be here.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

My subject today is learning.
And in that spirit, I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.
Ready?
When does learning begin?
Now as you ponder that question, maybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten, the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher.
Or maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork.
Maybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement, which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones.
And so your answer to my question would be: Learning begins at birth.
Well today I want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible, but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology.
And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we're born, while we're still in the womb.
Now I'm a science reporter.
I write books and magazine articles.
And I'm also a mother.
And those two roles came together for me in a book that I wrote called "Origins."
"Origins" is a report from the front lines of an exciting new field called fetal origins.
Fetal origins is a scientific discipline that emerged just about two decades ago, and it's based on the theory that our health and well-being throughout our lives is crucially affected by the nine months we spend in the womb.
Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me.
I was myself pregnant while I was doing the research for the book.
And one of the most fascinating insights I took from this work is that we're all learning about the world even before we enter it.
When we hold our babies for the first time, we might imagine that they're clean slates, unmarked by life, when in fact, they've already been shaped by us and by the particular world we live in.
Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things that scientists are discovering about what fetuses learn while they're still in their mothers' bellies.
First of all, they learn the sound of their mothers' voices.
Because sounds from the outside world have to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus, the voices fetuses hear, starting around the fourth month of gestation, are muted and muffled.
One researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher in the old "Peanuts" cartoon.
But the pregnant woman's own voice reverberates through her body, reaching the fetus much more readily.
And because the fetus is with her all the time, it hears her voice a lot.
Once the baby's born, it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else's.
How can we know this?
Newborn babies can't do much, but one thing they're really good at is sucking.
Researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples, so that if a baby sucks on one, it hears a recording of its mother's voice on a pair of headphones, and if it sucks on the other nipple, it hears a recording of a female stranger's voice.
Babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one.
Scientists also take advantage of the fact that babies will slow down their sucking when something interests them and resume their fast sucking when they get bored.
This is how researchers discovered that, after women repeatedly read aloud a section of Dr. Seuss' "The Cat in the Hat" while they were pregnant, their newborn babies recognized that passage when they hear it outside the womb.
My favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that show once they were born.
So fetuses are even learning about the particular language that's spoken in the world that they'll be born into.
A study published last year found that from birth, from the moment of birth, babies cry in the accent of their mother's native language.
French babies cry on a rising note while German babies end on a falling note, imitating the melodic contours of those languages.
Now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful?
It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.
From the moment of birth, the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it -- its mother.
It even makes its cries sound like the mother's language, which may further endear the baby to the mother, and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its native language.
But it's not just sounds that fetuses are learning about in utero.
It's also tastes and smells.
By seven months of gestation, the fetus' taste buds are fully developed, and its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell, are functioning.
The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid, which is continuously swallowed by the fetus.
Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they're out in the world.
In one experiment, a group of pregnant women was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice during their third trimester of pregnancy, while another group of pregnant women drank only water.
Six months later, the women's infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice, and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it.
The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot-flavored cereal, they seemed to enjoy it more.
A sort of French version of this experiment was carried out in Dijon, France where researchers found that mothers who consumed food and drink flavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy showed a preference for anise on their first day of life, and again, when they were tested later, on their fourth day of life.
Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy showed a reaction that translated roughly as "yuck."
What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat.
Fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they'll be joining through one of culture's most powerful expressions, which is food.
They're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture's cuisine even before birth.
Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons.
But before I get to that, I want to address something that you may be wondering about.
The notion of fetal learning may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus -- like playing Mozart through headphones placed on a pregnant belly.
But actually, the nine-month-long process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral and consequential than that.
Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life -- the air she breathes, the food and drink she consumes, the chemicals she's exposed to, even the emotions she feels -- are shared in some fashion with her fetus.
They make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself.
The fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body, makes them part of its flesh and blood.
And often it does something more.
It treats these maternal contributions as information, as what I like to call biological postcards from the world outside.
So what a fetus is learning about in utero is not Mozart's "Magic Flute" but answers to questions much more critical to its survival.
Will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity?
Will it be safe and protected, or will it face constant dangers and threats?
Will it live a long, fruitful life or a short, harried one?
The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind.
The resulting tuning and tweaking of a fetus' brain and other organs are part of what give us humans our enormous flexibility, our ability to thrive in a huge variety of environments, from the country to the city, from the tundra to the desert.
To conclude, I want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world even before they're born.
In the autumn of 1944, the darkest days of World War II, German troops blockaded Western Holland, turning away all shipments of food.
The opening of the Nazi's siege was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades -- so cold the water in the canals froze solid.
Soon food became scarce, with many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day -- a quarter of what they consumed before the war.
As weeks of deprivation stretched into months, some resorted to eating tulip bulbs.
By the beginning of May, the nation's carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted.
The specter of mass starvation loomed.
And then on May 5th, 1945, the siege came to a sudden end when Holland was liberated by the Allies.
The "Hunger Winter," as it came to be known, killed some 10,000 people and weakened thousands more.
But there was another population that was affected -- the 40,000 fetuses in utero during the siege.
Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy were immediately apparent in higher rates of stillbirths, birth defects, low birth weights and infant mortality.
But others wouldn't be discovered for many years.
Decades after the "Hunger Winter," researchers documented that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege have more obesity, more diabetes and more heart disease in later life than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.
These individuals' prenatal experience of starvation seems to have changed their bodies in myriad ways.
They have higher blood pressure, poorer cholesterol profiles and reduced glucose tolerance -- a precursor of diabetes.
Why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later?
One explanation is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.
When food is scarce, they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain, and away from other organs like the heart and liver.
This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term, but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs, deprived early on, become more susceptible to disease.
But that may not be all that's going on.
It seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly.
They're preparing themselves for the kind of world they will encounter on the other side of the womb.
The fetus adjusts its metabolism and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it.
And the basis of the fetus' prediction is what its mother eats.
The meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story, a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation.
This story imparts information that the fetus uses to organize its body and its systems -- an adaptation to prevailing circumstances that facilitates its future survival.
Faced with severely limited resources, a smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirements will, in fact, have a better chance of living to adulthood.
The real trouble comes when pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators, when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty.
This is what happened to the children of the Dutch "Hunger Winter."
And their higher rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease are the result.
Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post-war Western diet.
The world they had learned about while in utero was not the same as the world into which they were born.
Here's another story.
At 8:46 a.m. on September 11th, 2001, there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the World Trade Center in New York -- commuters spilling off trains, waitresses setting tables for the morning rush, brokers already working the phones on Wall Street.
1,700 of these people were pregnant women.
When the planes struck and the towers collapsed, many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster -- the overwhelming chaos and confusion, the rolling clouds the heart-pounding fear for their lives.
About a year after 9/11, researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.
In the babies of those women who developed post-traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD, following their ordeal, researchers discovered a biological marker of susceptibility to PTSD -- an effect that was most pronounced in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe in their third trimester.
In other words, the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their children while they were still in utero.
Now consider this: post-traumatic stress syndrome appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong, causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering.
But there's another way of thinking about PTSD.
What looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances.
In a particularly dangerous environment, the characteristic manifestations of PTSD -- a hyper-awareness of one's surroundings, a quick-trigger response to danger -- could save someone's life.
The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive is still speculative, but I find it rather poignant.
It would mean that, even before birth, mothers are warning their children that it's a wild world out there, telling them, "Be careful."
Let me be clear.
Fetal origins research is not about blaming women for what happens during pregnancy.
It's about discovering how best to promote the health and well-being of the next generation.
That important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they spend in the womb.
Learning is one of life's most essential activities, and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined.
Thank you.

<title>Annie Murphy Paul: What we learn before we're born</title>
<description>Pop quiz: When does learning begin? Answer: Before we are born. Science writer Annie Murphy Paul talks through new research that shows how much we learn in the womb -- from the lilt of our native language to our soon-to-be-favorite foods.</description>
<keywords>children,education,food,science,writing</keywords>

The stories we tell about each other matter very much.
The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.
And most of all, I think the way that we participate in each other's stories is of deep importance.
I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor.
Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves, I heard them from my Sunday school teacher and Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.
I remember learning that people who were poor needed something material -- food, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have.
And I also was taught, coupled with that, that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job, apparently, to help.
This is what Jesus asked of us.
And then he said, "What you do for the least of these, you do for me."
Now I was pretty psyched.
I was very eager to be useful in the world -- I think we all have that feeling.
And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.
That was news to me, and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.
But I also learned very soon thereafter that Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing, the poor would always be with us.
This frustrated and confused me; I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment that I had to do, and I was excited to do, but no matter what I would do, I would fail.
So I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry, like maybe I'd misunderstood something here.
And I felt overwhelmed.
And for the first time, I began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.
I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away, that would always be with us.
They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things, which I was excited to do, but I didn't know how it was going to work.
And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give, especially if the problem was never going away.
In the years following, the other stories I heard about the poor growing up were no more positive.
For example, I saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering.
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.
I heard about disease, I heard about war -- they always seemed to be kind of related.
And in general, I got this sort of idea that the poor in the world lived lives that were wrought with suffering and sadness, devastation, hopelessness.
And after a while, I developed what I think many of us do, is this predictable response, where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth, because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.
And so naturally, I started to distance myself.
I stopped listening to their stories And I stopped expecting things to really change.
Now I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.
I gave of my time and my money, I gave when solutions were on sale.
The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.
I mean who can argue with that?
I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid and I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough that I gave to relieve my own suffering, not someone else's.
The truth be told, I was giving out of that place, not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity.
It became a transaction for me, became sort of a trade.
I was purchasing something -- I was buying my right to go on with my day and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.
And I think the way that we go through that sometimes disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.
And it can also turn into a commodity, which is a very scary thing.
So as I did this, and as I think many of us do this, we kind of buy our distance, we kind of buy our right to go on with our day.
I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.
It can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life and, in short to love.
Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.
I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is, but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak, Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance.
When I heard him speak, it was three years before that.
But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well -- think of that as financial services for the poor.
Think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.
Dr. Yunus shared his story, explaining what that was, and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.
He also talked about, in particular, microlending, which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business.
Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.
First and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world that, for once, showed me, maybe, a way to interact with someone and to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird and didn't make me feel bad -- that was exciting.
But more importantly, he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories I had heard before.
In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.
He was talking about strong, smart, hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.
All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital.
It was an amazing sort of insight for me.
And I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this -- it's hard to express now how much that affected me -- but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later, and I moved to East Africa to try to see for myself what this was about.
For the first time, actually, in a long time I wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs, and see for myself what their lives were actually about.
So I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business.
And in fact, through those interactions, for the first time, I was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away.
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.
And over and over again, as I interviewed them and spent my days with them, I did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change.
So I would hear from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.
Their business trajectory would change.
They would make a little bit more money; their standard of living would shift and would get better.
And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives, like they would start to send their children to school.
They might be able to buy mosquito nets.
Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when I came as their guest and that made them feel proud.
But there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row, and some days that's what happened -- these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them.
That was another thing that really touched me.
It was really humbling to see for the first time, to really understand that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything, I probably would have gotten a lot wrong.
Because the best way for people to change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.
So I saw that and it was very humbling.
Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.
I never once was asked for a donation, which had kind of been my mode, right.
There's poverty, you give money to help -- no one asked me for a donation.
In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.
If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities.
So what I did hear, once in a while, was that people wanted a loan -- I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.
And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school, so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.
I just got this impression that the money would work.
And my introduction to business was in these $100 little infuses of capital.
And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things, from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.
So this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family, and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans, that's this little idea that turned into Kiva.
A few months later, I went back to Uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built, and took pictures of seven of my new friends, posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website, spammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal.
Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details, but do you say, do you want to help participate in this, provide the money that they need?"
The money came in basically overnight.
We sent it over to Uganda.
And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened; the entrepreneurs received the money, they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew, and they were able to support themselves and change the trajectory of their lives.
In October of '05, after those first seven loans were paid, Matt and I took the word beta off of the site.
We said, "Our little experiment has been a success.
Let's start for real." That was our official launch.
And then that first year, October '05 through '06, Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.
The second year, it was a total of 15 million.
The third year, the total was up to around 40.
The fourth year, we were just short of 100.
And today, less than five years in, Kiva's facilitated more than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits, from lenders and entrepreneurs -- more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.
So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.
And while those numbers and those statistics to me, Kiva's really about stories.
It's about retelling the story of the poor, and it's about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity, validates a partnership relationship, not a relationship that's based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen.
But instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this optimism that together we can move forward.
So what I hope is that, not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva -- that's a very positive and meaningful thing -- but I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said, between the traditional rich and poor categories that we're taught to see in the world, this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines.
Because as that happens, I think we can feel free to interact in a way that's more open, more just and more creative, to engage with each other and to help each other.
Imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you're about to approach them.
Imagine how you feel; and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work who wants to tell you about their business.
Maybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.
Imagine if you're speaking with somebody who's growing things and making them flourish, somebody who's using their talents to do something productive, somebody who's built their own business from scratch, someone who is surrounded by abundance, not scarcity, who's in fact creating abundance, somebody with full hands with something to offer, not empty hands asking for you to give them something.
Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect of somebody who wakes up every day and works very, very hard to make their life better.
These stories can really change the way that we think about each other.
And if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money, I think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other's potential.
Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning.
And as I look forward to what is next, it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.
The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.
Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years, have taught me what entrepreneurship is.
And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.
You see an opportunity and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.
In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today and going after that.
Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.
So they're not a donation.
Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.
But in fact, when you give something to someone and they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go, that's one thing.
When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time, you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.
This continued attention -- this ongoing attention -- is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us.
And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know, when all else is equal, given the option to have just money to do what you need to do, or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community, people choose the community plus the money.
That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.
So with that in mind, this particular incident has led to the things that I'm working on now.
I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.
And one thing that I've seen is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.
With social networks, it's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us in our own supportive communities, rapidly.
I've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas and to catalyze all of us to make tomorrow better than today?
As I've researched what's going on in the United States, a few interesting little insights have come up.
So one is that, of course, as we all might expect, many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month.
But there's always a need for resources close by.
Another thing is, it turns out, those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect -- banks, venture capitalists, other organizations and support structures -- they come from friends and family.
Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family.
That's around 130 billion dollars a year -- it's a lot.
And third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process, it's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for, how to ask, what to promise in return, even though they have the best of intentions and want to thank those people that are supporting them.
So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves exactly what that financial exchange should look like, exactly what fits them and the people around them, this week actually, we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder, which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need through investments from their friends and family.
And it's investments, not donations, not loans, but investments that have a dynamic return.
So the mapping of participating in the story, it actually flows with the up and down.
So in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds.
And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile, create investment terms in a really easy way.
We make it really, really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site.
And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.
They can raise up to a million dollars from an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors -- everyday people, heaven forbid -- and they can share those returns over time -- again, whatever terms they set.
As investors choose to become involved based on those terms, they can either take their rewards back as cash, or they can decide in advance to give those returns away to a non-profit.
So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.
It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people around them that they already have, the people that know them best and that love them and want to support them, to gather them to make this happen.
So that's what I'm working on now.
And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.
Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning, and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.
What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it, just like they've cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections.
But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care -- I'm not even going to try.
I don't think, even though we often hear, you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons, the religious reasons, "Here's why caring and giving will make you happier."
I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know; in fact, I think we know so much, and it's such a reality that we care so deeply, that in fact, what usually stops us is that we're afraid to try and to mess up, because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other's lives.
So what I think I can do today, that best thing I can give you -- And I think I can remind us that we do care.
I think we all already know that.
And I think we know that love is resilient enough Just a sec.
Thanks.
Thanks.
For me, the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen to someone else's story.
And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED.
And I'm grateful that whenever I do that, guaranteed, I am inspired -- I am inspired by the person I am listening to.
And I believe more and more every time I listen in that that person's potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help.
And that -- forget the tools, forget the moving around of resources -- that stuff's easy.
Believing in each other, really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world, that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us.
So that, this belief in each other, knowing that without a doubt and practicing that every day in whatever you do, that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today.
Thank you.

<description>What do you think of people in poverty? Maybe what Jessica Jackley once did: "they" need "our" help, in the form of a few coins in a jar. The co-founder of Kiva.org talks about how her attitude changed -- and how her work with microloans has brought new power to people who live on a few dollars a day.</description>

Today I'm going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep, so dark, so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.
It's a place of myth and legend.
It's a place marked on ancient maps as "here be monsters."
It is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.
Instead, they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.
We are talking about the high seas.
The "high seas" is a legal term, but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.
With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth.
It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all.
But in reality, it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it.
So today I'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark.
We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care.
And then finally, we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation, but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect.
So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue.
To me, as an international lawyer, this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen, for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean, the global ocean, that provides us all with carbon storage, with heat storage, with oxygen, if you can only protect 36 percent.
This is indeed the true heart of the planet.
Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws -- for example, shipping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to shore.
For example, garbage discharge, something you would think just simply goes away, but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore.
As a result, we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas.
It's unbelievable.
We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution, but that has proved to be no longer the case.
So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all.
And these include a sense of shared responsibility, common norms that bind people together as a community.
Conditional access: You can invite people in, but they have to be able to play by the rules.
And of course, if you want people to play by the rules, you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement, for as we've discovered, you can trust, but you also need to verify.
What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas.
For a group of very dedicated individuals -- scientists, conservationists, photographers and states -- were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you.
That is, we're able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling.
And how did we do that?
Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process.
But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations, trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed.
So within three years, from 2003 to 2006, we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep-sea bottom trawling.
Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want," we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm.
In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress, they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected.
This does not mean that it's the final solution, or that this even provides permanent protection.
But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed, to create a new regime.
So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true, blue perspective for this beautiful planet.
Sylvia's wish provides us with that leverage, that access to the heart of human beings, you might say, who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes, but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles, who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.
Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas, just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain.
The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there.
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm, and five showed up in the U.K. just recently.
But the Sargasso Sea, the same way it aggregates sargassum weed, actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region.
This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself.
But there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are 200,000 pieces of plastic per square-kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea, and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sargasso Sea for its protection and its food.
The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.
It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs.
But what I'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection.
Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction -- but the vast majority is beyond -- to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area.
Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now: the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.
It's actually a bay.
It's considered high seas, because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims.
So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.
But what makes the Ross Sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what, till recently, has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem.
But unfortunately, CCAMLR, the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources, is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region.
The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales, who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food.
So what we need to do is to stand up boldly, singly and together, to push governments, to push regional fisheries management organizations, to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing, so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.
Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales.
There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long.
But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is, in fact, it's not a permanent place.
It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.
So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.
It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries, but it moves with the season.
As such, it does create a challenge to protect, but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.
We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are, in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable, which may, in some cases, be year-round.
Getting closer to shore, where we are, this was in fact taken in the Galapagos.
Many species are headed through this region, which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area.
That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative.
It's protecting five World Heritage sites.
Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction, at present.
So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas.
So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention, so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites, or we need to change the name and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.
But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre, where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this, or as bycatch.
So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.
We need to work locally, but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.
We have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean-basin-wide initiative.
We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project, one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.
It's provided us data like this, of tiny, little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home.
They fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year.
So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.
And its culminating year that's going to be launched in October.
So stay tuned for further information.
What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators; it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column, where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found.
And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN, to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers.
We have the support of governments now behind us.
We've been revealing this information through technical workshops.
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots, hotspots.
At the same time we're saying, "Yes, we need more. We need to move forward."
But many of you have said, if you get these marine protected areas, or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place, how are you going to enforce it?
Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science, which is outer space technology.
I wanted to be an astronaut, so I've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space -- and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about, in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life-cycles in the open ocean.
We can also tag and track fishing vessels.
Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.
But not all the vessels have those to date.
It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate, if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources, we need to know -- someone needs to know -- where you are and what you're doing.
So it brings me to my main take-home message, which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.
We can stop the collision course of 50 percent of the planet with the high seas.
But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.
We need to change how we actually go about managing these resources.
We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect.
At the same time, we need to think locally, which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish, is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas, and to bring people to the table, if you will, to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management.
And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.
Our species are ocean-basin-wide.
Many of the deep-sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean-basin-wide.
We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect.
And in order to do that, you also need ocean-basin management regimes.
That is, we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone, but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity, so they're like the Southern Ocean, where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization.
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.
It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote.
So on this tour, I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas: one, that it is our home too, and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.
Thank you.

My journey to coming here today started in 1974.
That's me with the funny gloves.
I was 17 and going on a peace walk.
What I didn't know though, was most of those people, standing there with me, were Moonies.
And within a week I had come to believe that the second coming of Christ had occurred, that it was Sun Myung Moon, and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God to be his disciple.
Now as cool as that sounds, my family was not that thrilled with this.
And they tried everything they could to get me out of there.
There was an underground railroad of sorts that was going on during those years. Maybe some of you remember it.
They were called deprogrammers.
And after about five long years my family had me deprogrammed.
And I then became a deprogrammer.
I started going out on cases.
And after about five years of doing this, I was arrested for kidnapping.
Most of the cases I went out on were called involuntary.
What happened was that the family had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow.
And so they took them to some safe place.
And we would come in and talk to them, usually for about a week.
And so after this happened, I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work.
And about 20 years went by.
There was a burning question though that would not leave me.
And that was, "How did this happen to me?"
And in fact, what did happen to my brain?
Because something did.
And so I decided to write a book, a memoir, about this decade of my life.
And toward the end of writing that book there was a documentary that came out.
It was on Jonestown.
And it had a chilling effect on me.
These are the dead in Jonestown.
About 900 people died that day, most of them taking their own lives.
Women gave poison to their babies, and watched foam come from their mouths as they died.
The top picture is a group of Moonies that have been blessed by their messiah.
Their mates were chosen for them.
The bottom picture is Hitler youth.
This is the leg of a suicide bomber.
The thing I had to admit to myself, with great repulsion, was that I get it.
I understand how this could happen.
I understand how someone's brain, how someone's mind can come to the place where it makes sense -- in fact it would be wrong, when your brain is working like that -- not to try to save the world through genocide.
And so what is this? How does this work?
And how I've come to view what happened to me is a viral, memetic infection.
For those of you who aren't familiar with memetics, a meme has been defined as an idea that replicates in the human brain and moves from brain to brain like a virus, much like a virus. The way a virus works is -- it can infect and do the most damage to someone who has a compromised immune system.
In 1974, I was young, I was naive, and I was pretty lost in my world.
I was really idealistic.
These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable.
What happens is that circular logic takes over.
"Moon is one with God.
God is going to fix all the problems in the world.
All I have to do is humbly follow.
Because God is going to stop war and hunger -- all these things I wanted to do -- all I have to do is humbly follow.
Because after all, God is [working through] the messiah. He's going to fix all this."
It becomes impenetrable.
And the most dangerous part of this is that is creates "us" and "them," "right" and "wrong," "good" and "evil."
And it makes anything possible, makes anything rationalizable.
And the thing is, though, if you looked at my brain during those years in the Moonies -- neuroscience is expanding exponentially, as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding.
We're beginning to look inside the brain.
And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this, and compared it to anyone in this room, or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis, I am convinced it would look very, very different.
And that, strange as it may sound, gives me hope.
And the reason that gives me hope is that the first thing is to admit that we have a problem.
But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will.
It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us.
And so this is something that, through research and education, I believe that we can solve.
And so the first step is to realize that we can do this together, and that there is no "us" and "them."
Thank you very much.

This is poo, and what I want to do today is share my passion for poo with you, which might be quite difficult, but I think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo.
So this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do things that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing.
And basically it's all evolved to handle its food source, which is dung.
So the question is, where do we start this story?
And it seems appropriate to start at the end, because this is a waste product that comes out of other animals, but it still contains nutrients and there are sufficient nutrients in there for dung beetles basically to make a living, and so dung beetles eat dung, and their larvae are also dung-feeders.
They are grown completely in a ball of dung.
Within South Africa, we've got about 800 species of dung beetles, in Africa we've got 2,000 species of dung beetles, and in the world we have about 6,000 species of dung beetles.
So, according to dung beetles, dung is pretty good.
Unless you're prepared to get dung under your fingernails and root through the dung itself, you'll never see 90 percent of the dung beetle species, because they go directly into the dung, straight down below it, and then they shuttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make underground.
So the question is, how do they deal with this material?
And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort.
Ten percent of the species actually make a ball, and this ball they roll away from the dung source, usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source, and they have a very particular behavior by which they are able to roll their balls.
So this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball.
You can see it's a male because he's got a little hair on the back of his legs there, and he's clearly very pleased about what he's sitting on there.
And then he's about to become a victim of a vicious smash-and-grab.
And this is a clear indication that this is a valuable resource.
And so valuable resources have to be looked after and guarded in a particular way, and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because of this, because of the competition that is involved in getting hold of that dung.
So this dung pat was actually -- well, it was a dung pat 15 minutes before this photograph was taken, and we think it's the intense competition that makes the beetles so well-adapted to rolling balls of dung.
So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the African veld.
Its head is down. It's walking backwards.
It's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction, and at the same time it's got to deal with the heat.
This is Africa. It's hot.
So what I want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investigate how dung beetles deal with these problems.
So watch this beetle, and there's two things that I would like you to be aware of.
The first is how it deals with this obstacle that we've put in its way. See, look, it does a little dance, and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place.
A little dance, and then heads off in a particular direction.
So clearly this animal knows where it's going and it knows where it wants to go, and that's a very, very important thing, because if you think about it, you're at the dung pile, you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else, and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line.
So we gave them some more tasks to deal with, and what we did here is we turned the world under their feet. And watch its response.
So this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet. It's turned by 90 degrees.
But it doesn't flinch. It knows exactly where it wants to go, and it heads off in that particular direction.
So our next question then was, how are they doing this?
What are they doing? And there was a cue that was available to us.
It was that every now and then they'd climb on top of the ball and they'd take a look at the world around them.
And what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball?
What are the obvious cues that this animal could use to direct its movement? And the most obvious one is to look at the sky, and so we thought, now what could they be looking at in the sky?
And the obvious thing to look at is the sun.
So a classic experiment here, in that what we did was we moved the sun.
What we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position.
And look at what the beetle does.
It does a little double dance, and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went in the first place.
What happens now? So clearly they're looking at the sun.
The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them.
The thing is the sun is not always available to you, because at sunset it disappears below the horizon.
What is happening in the sky here is that there's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky that you and I can't see. It's the way our eyes are built.
But the sun is at the horizon over here and we know that when the sun is at the horizon, say it's over on this side, there is a north-south, a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we can't see that the beetles can see.
So how do we test that? Well, that's easy.
What we do is we get a great big polarization filter, pop the beetle underneath it, and the filter is at right angles to the polarization pattern of the sky.
The beetle comes out from underneath the filter and it does a right-hand turn, because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in.
So obviously beetles can see polarized light.
Okay, so what we've got so far is, what are beetles doing? They're rolling balls.
How are they doing it? Well, they're rolling them in a straight line.
How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line?
Well, they're looking at celestial cues in the sky, some of which you and I can't see.
But how do they pick up those celestial cues?
That was what was of interest to us next.
And it was this particular little behavior, the dance, that we thought was important, because look, it takes a pause every now and then, and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in.
So what are they doing when they do this dance?
How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves?
And in this experiment here, what we did was we forced them into a channel, and you can see he wasn't particularly forced into this particular channel, and we gradually displaced the beetle by 180 degrees until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction that it wanted to go in, in the first place.
And let's see what his reaction is as he's headed through 90 degrees here, and now he's going to -- when he ends up down here, he's going to be 180 degrees in the wrong direction.
And see what his response is.
He does a little dance, he turns around, and heads back in this. He knows exactly where he's going.
He knows exactly what the problem is, and he knows exactly how to deal with it, and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to reorientate themselves.
So that's the dance, but after spending many years sitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days, we noticed that there was another behavior associated with the dance behavior.
Every now and then, when they climb on top of the ball, they wipe their face.
And you see him do it again.
Now we thought, now what could be going on here?
Clearly the ground is very hot, and when the ground is hot, they dance more often, and when they do this particular dance, they wipe the bottom of their face.
And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior.
We thought that maybe what they're doing is trying to get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face to cool their head down.
So what we did was design a couple of arenas.
one was hot, one was cold.
We shaded this one. We left that one hot.
And then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera.
So what you're looking at here is a heat image of the system, and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball.
So the truth is, if you look at the temperature over here, dung is cool.
So all we're interested in here is comparing the temperature of the beetle against the background.
So the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade.
The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about 30 to 35 degrees centigrade, so this is a great big ball of ice cream that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld.
It isn't climbing. It isn't dancing, because its body temperature is actually relatively low.
It's about the same as yours and mine.
And what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool.
But if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment, look at the temperature of the soil.
It's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade.
Watch how often the beetle dances.
And look at its front legs. They're roaringly hot.
So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow, and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face, and all the time it's trying to cool itself down, we think, and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across.
And what we did then was put little boots on these legs, because this was a way to test if the legs were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil.
And if you look over here, with boots they climb onto the ball far less often when they had no boots on.
So we described these as cool boots.
It was a dental compound that we used to make these boots.
And we also cooled down the dung ball, so we were able to put the ball in the fridge, gave them a nice cool dung ball, and they climbed onto that ball far less often than when they had a hot ball.
So this is called stilting. It's a thermal behavior that you and I do if we cross the beach, we jump onto a towel, somebody has this towel -- "Sorry, I've jumped onto your towel." -- and then you scuttle across onto somebody else's towel, and that way you don't burn your feet.
And that's exactly what the beetles are doing here.
However, there's one more story I'd like to share with you, and that's this particular species.
It's from a genus called Pachysoma.
There are 13 species in the genus, and they have a particular behavior that I think you will find interesting.
This is a dung beetle. Watch what he's doing.
Can you spot the difference?
They don't normally go this slowly. It's in slow motion.
but it's walking forwards, and it's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it.
This is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior.
There's one more interesting aspect of this dung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating, and that's that it forages and provisions a nest.
So watch this individual here, and what he's trying to do is set up a nest.
And he doesn't like this first position, but he comes up with a second position, and about 50 minutes later, that nest is finished, and he heads off to forage and provision at a pile of dry dung pellets.
And what I want you to notice is the outward path compared to the homeward path, and compare the two.
And by and large, you'll see that the homeward path is far more direct than the outward path.
On the outward path, he's always on the lookout for a new blob of dung.
On the way home, he knows where home is, and he wants to go straight to it.
The important thing here is that this is not a one-way trip, as in most dung beetles. The trip here is repeated back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site.
And watch, you're going to see another South African crime taking place right now.
And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets.
So what we're looking at here is a behavior called path integration.
And what's taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food, and then when it finds food, it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is.
Now there's two ways it could be doing that, and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it's at the foraging site.
If it's using landmarks, it will find its home.
If it is using something called path integration, it will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot, and what it's doing here if it's using path integration is it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction.
It knows the bearing home, and it knows it should be in that direction.
If you displace it, it ends up in the wrong place.
So let's see what happens when we put this beetle to the test with a similar experiment.
So here's our cunning experimenter.
He displaces the beetle, and now we have to see what is going to take place.
What we've got is a burrow. That's where the forage was.
The forage has been displaced to a new position.
If he's using landmark orientation, he should be able to find the burrow, because he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it.
If he's using path integration, then it should end up in the wrong spot over here.
So let's watch what happens when we put the beetle through the whole test.
So there he is there.
He's about to head home, and look what happens.
Shame.
It hasn't a clue.
It starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food, but it is clearly completely lost.
So we know now that this animal uses path integration to find its way around, and the callous experimenter leads it top left and leaves it.
So what we're looking at here are a group of animals that use a compass, and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around, and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance, and we know that these species here actually count the steps. That's what they use as an odometer, a step-counting system, to find their way back home.
We don't know yet what dung beetles use.
So what have we learned from these animals with a brain that's the size of a grain of rice?
Well, we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues.
We know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior and it's also a thermoregulation behavior, and we also know that they use a path integration system for finding their way home.
So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance we can actually learn an awful lot from these things doing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do.
Thank you.

<title>Marcus Byrne: The dance of the dung beetle</title>
<description>A dung beetle has a brain the size of a grain of rice, and yet shows a tremendous amount of intelligence when it comes to rolling its food source -- animal excrement -- home. How? It all comes down to a dance. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

So I understand that this meeting was planned, and the slogan was From Was to Still.
And I am illustrating Still.
Which, of course, I am not agreeing with because, although I am 94, I am not still working.
And anybody who asks me, "Are you still doing this or that?"
I don't answer because I'm not doing things still, I'm doing it like I always did.
I still have -- or did I use the word still? I didn't mean that.
I have my file which is called To Do. I have my plans.
I have my clients. I am doing my work like I always did.
So this takes care of my age.
I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here.
This was about 1925.
All of these things were made during the last 75 years.
But, of course, I'm working since 25, doing more or less what you see here. This is Castleton China.
This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.
This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum.
This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale.
This is a portrait of my daughter and myself.
These were just some of the things I've made.
I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years.
I call myself a maker of things.
I don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things.
Industrial designers want to make novel things.
Novelty is a concept of commerce, not an aesthetic concept.
The industrial design magazine, I believe, is called "Innovation."
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work.
Well, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant, more comfortable than just the craftsmen do.
I have so much to say. I have to think what I am going to say.
Well, to describe our profession otherwise, we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty.
That means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of Man.
Sarah Smith, who was a mathematics professor at MIT, wrote, "The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity -- that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from the playful search for beauty."
These are tiles. The word, "playful" is a necessary aspect of our work because, actually, one of our problems is that we have to make, produce, lovely things throughout all of life, and this for me is now 75 years.
So how can you, without drying up, make things with the same pleasure, as a gift to others, for so long?
The playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer.
Let me tell you some about my life.
As I said, I started to do these things 75 years ago.
My first exhibition in the United States was at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 -- that the Hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn pieces as part of the exhibit.
My work actually took me through many countries, and showed me a great part of the world.
This is not that they took me -- the work didn't take me -- I made the things particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world.
I was incredibly curious to see the world, and I made all these things, which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures.
I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman, and this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages.
The guild system: that means when I was an apprentice, I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master.
In my shop where I studied, or learned, there was a traditional hierarchy of master, journeyman and learned worker, and apprentice, and I worked as the apprentice.
The work as an apprentice was very primitive.
That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand.
We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.
After that, it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in, kind of, a mangle.
And then finally it was prepared for the throwing.
And there I really worked as an apprentice.
My master took me to set ovens because this was part of oven-making, oven-setting, in the time.
And finally, I had received a document that I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully, that I had behaved morally, and this document was given to me by the Guild of Roof-Coverers, Rail-Diggers, Oven-Setters, Chimney Sweeps and Potters.
I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions, and I still have that workbook.
First I set up a shop in my own garden, and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest.
And there I was sitting, and my then-boyfriend -- I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today -- but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots.
My mother thought that this was not very proper, so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity.
However, after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest, a pottery factory, a large one.
And I visited it with several ladies, and asked all sorts of questions of the director.
Then the director asked me, why do you ask all these questions?
I said, I also have a pottery.
So he asked me, could he please visit me, and then finally he did, and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism, that the industrial revolution had broken out, and that I rather should join the factory.
There he made an art department for me where I worked for several months.
However, everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department.
The director there said there were several women casting and producing my designs now in molds, and this was sold also to America.
I remember that it was quite successful.
However, the director, the chemist, model maker -- everybody -- concerned himself much more with the art department -- that means, with my work -- than making toilets, so finally they got a letter from the center, from the bank who owned the factory, saying, make toilet-setting behind the art department, and that was my end.
So this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman, and journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world.
So as a journeyman, I put an ad into the paper that I had studied, that I was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman and I was looking for a job as a journeyman.
And I got several answers, and I accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically, I thought, halfway to America.
And that was in Hamburg.
Then I first took this job in Hamburg, at an art pottery where everything was done on the wheel, and so I worked in a shop where there were several potters.
And the first day, I was coming to take my place at the turntable -- there were three or four turntables -- and one of them, behind where I was sitting, was a hunchback, a deaf-mute hunchback, who smelled very bad.
So I doused him in cologne every day, which he thought was very nice, and therefore he brought bread and butter every day, which I had to eat out of courtesy.
The first day I came to work in this shop there was on my wheel a surprise for me.
My colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work a very nicely modeled natural man's organs.
After I brushed them off with a hand motion, they were very -- I finally was now accepted, and worked there for some six months.
This was my first job.
If I go on like this, you will be here till midnight.
So I will try speed it up a little Moderator: Eva, we have about five minutes.
Eva Zeisel: Are you sure?
Moderator: Yes, I am sure.
EZ: Well, if you are sure, I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast.
And actually, my work took me to many countries because I used my work to fill my curiosity.
And among other things, other countries I worked, was in the Soviet Union, where I worked from '32 to '37 -- actually, to '36.
I was finally there, although I had nothing to do -- I was a foreign expert.
I became art director of the china and glass industry, and eventually under Stalin's purges -- at the beginning of Stalin's purges, I didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested.
So I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges, and spent 16 months in a Russian prison.
The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life.
This was a very dangerous accusation.
And if this is the end of my five minutes, I want to tell you that I actually did survive, which was a surprise.
But since I survived and I'm here, and since this is the end of the five minutes, I will -- Moderator: Tell me when your last trip to Russia was.
Weren't you there recently?
EZ: Oh, this summer, in fact, the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company, invited me.
They found out that I had worked in '33 at this factory, and they came to my studio in Rockland County, and brought the 15 of their artists to visit me here.
And they invited myself to come to the Russian factory last summer, in July, to make some dishes, design some dishes.
And since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter, so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today, which is not a very pleasant and happy view.
Here I am now, if this is the end? Thank you.

I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy, and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me.
Half the city was dark because of a power cut, and I was living on the dark side.
Now, Maui was terrified of the dark, so I had to carry him up the stairs, actually down the stairs first, for his walk, and then bring him back up.
I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day.
And through all of this, I had to hold a torch between my teeth.
The stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread.
For a shower, I walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym.
But these were not the major preoccupations of my day.
It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices.
I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.
I wasn't the only one.
Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street.
Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology, and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.
I think there's nothing like a crisis to tell you what's really important and what's not, and Sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter.
The self as we once knew it no longer exists, and I think that an abstract, digital universe has become a part of our identity, and I want to talk to you about what I think that means.
I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common.
They're both stories, interpretations.
You and I can experience things without a story.
We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless.
But the larger sense that we have of our lives, the slightly more abstract one, is indirect.
Our story of our life is based on direct experience, but it's embellished.
A novel needs scene after scene to build, and the story of our life needs an arc as well.
It needs months and years.
Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters.
But the story is not about these chapters.
It's the whole book.
It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness, the victories and the disappointments, but it's because how because of these, and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these, we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves.
Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time: a long arc of time that is our lifespan, and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment.
Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment, but the one that narrates needs several moments, a whole sequence of them, and that's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time.
Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything, in the erosion of a grain of sand, in the budding of a little bud into a rose.
Without it, we would have no music.
Our own emotions and state of mind often encode time, regret or nostalgia about the past, hope or dread about the future.
I think that technology has altered that flow of time.
The overall time that we have for our narrative, our lifespan, has been increasing, but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk.
It has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time, and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world, and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers.
All of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen.
Science can do things with and in a picosecond, but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second.
You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow, to the sun, the moon and the seasons, and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past, the present and the future to see things for what they are, to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations.
We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect, not just in the material world, but in our own intentions and our motivations.
What happens when that arrow goes awry?
What happens when time warps?
So many of us today have the sensation that time's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once.
This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one.
We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time.
Far away over there is now here.
News from India is a stream on my smartphone app whether I'm in New York or New Delhi.
And that's not all.
Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year, your former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends, because the Internet also archives, and it warps the past.
With no distinction left between the past, the present and the future, and the here or there, we are left with this moment everywhere, this moment that I'll call the digital now.
Just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now?
This digital now is not the present, because it's always a few seconds ahead, with Twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones.
This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book.
This now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state.
Its focus, instead, is to distract us at every turn on the road.
Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else.
Are you reading an interview by an author?
Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.
Like it. Find other books exactly like his.
Find other people reading those books.
Travel can be liberating, but when it is incessant, we become permanent exiles without repose.
Choice is freedom, but not when it's constantly for its own sake.
Not just is the digital now far from the present, but it's in direct competition with it, and this is because not just am I absent from it, but so are you.
Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else.
And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror.
I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night, shop for Parisian macarons, and leave video messages that get picked up later.
At all times, I can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you, while I sustain the illusion that I'm tapped into you in real time.
Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter.
There were those with power and water, and those without.
There are those who went back to their lives, and those who are still displaced after so many months.
For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does, and then, like an ironic slap in the face, it makes it true.
For example, it's said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets.
Now if this rift, which is already so great in many parts of the world, between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology, isn't somehow bridged, there will be ruptures between the digital and the real.
For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it, the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous.
How does one live inside distraction?
We might think that those younger than us, those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.
Possibly, but I remember my childhood.
I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me.
Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube, and Vienna had a Spanish riding school.
If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks, but it really wouldn't be the same, because much later, I went to Vienna, and I went to the Spanish riding school, and I could feel my grandfather right beside me.
Night after night, he took me up on the terrace, on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me.
And even here, when I look at the Great Bear, I get back that feeling of being a child, hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder, and I can get back that feeling of being a child again.
What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact, but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact.
Time-warping technology challenges our deepest core, because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget, even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable.
We want to clutch, and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments.
They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.
By archiving everything, we think that we can store it, but time is not data.
It cannot be stored.
You and I know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment.
It might have happened while we were playing an instrument, or looking into the eyes of someone we've known for a very long time.
At such moments, our selves are complete.
The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one.
The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future.
The present joins a flow of time from before and after.
I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.
I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it.
I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen, cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.
My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take, that time can't be fought, and because it will pass and it will move, we owe the present moment our full attention.
Attention is time.
One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention, and definitely from my grandmother, love and attention were one and the same thing.
The digital world cannibalizes time, and in doing so, I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves.
It threatens the flow of love.
But we don't need to let it.
We can choose otherwise.
We've seen again and again just how creative technology can be, and in our lives and in our actions, we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it.
We can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time.
We can choose to take time back.
Thank you.

I'm not at all a cook.
So don't fear, this is not going to be a cooking demonstration.
But I do want to talk to you about something that I think is dear to all of us.
And that is bread -- something which is as simple as our basic, most fundamental human staple.
And I think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form.
Unless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets, bread is standard.
Bread is not only standard in the Western diet.
As I will show to you, it is actually the mainstay of modern life.
So I'm going to bake bread for you.
In the meantime I'm also talking to you, so my life is going to complicated. Bear with me.
First of all, a little bit of audience participation.
I have two loaves of bread here.
One is a supermarket standard: white bread, pre-packaged, which I'm told is called a Wonderbread.
I didn't know this word until I arrived.
And this is more or less, a whole-meal, handmade, small-bakery loaf of bread.
Here we go. I want to see a show of hands.
Who prefers the whole-meal bread?
Okay let me do this differently. Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all?
I have two tentative male hands.
Okay, now the question is really, why is this so?
And I think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity.
It's about a traditional way of living.
A way that is perhaps more real, more honest.
This is an image from Tuscany, where we feel agriculture is still about beauty.
And life is really, too.
And this is about good taste, good traditions.
Why do we have this image?
Why do we feel that this is more true than this?
Well I think it has a lot to do with our history.
In the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved, most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they were closely related to food production.
And we have this mythical image of how life was in rural areas in the past.
Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image.
It was a mythical past.
Of course, the reality is quite different.
These poor farmers working the land by hand or with their animals, had yield levels that are comparable to the poorest farmers today in West Africa.
But we have, somehow, in the course of the last few centuries, or even decades, started to cultivate an image of a mythical, rural agricultural past.
It was only 200 years ago that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution.
And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here, it's very important to understand what that revolution did to us.
It brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers.
And it actually drove up our yields.
And even sort of horrible things, like picking beans by hand, can now be done automatically.
All that is a real, great improvement, as we shall see.
Of course we also, particularly in the last decade, managed to envelop the world in a dense chain of supermarkets, in a chain of global trade.
And it means that you now eat products, which can come from all around the world.
That is the reality of our modern life.
Now you may prefer this loaf of bread.
Excuse my hands but this is how it is.
But actually the real relevant bread, historically, is this white Wonder loaf.
And don't despise the white bread because it really, I think, symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all.
And that is a feat that we are not really conscious of that much.
But it has changed the world.
This tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world.
So what is happening?
Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics.
With the advent of the Industrial Revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last few decades, since the 1960s, food availability, per head, in this world, has increased by 25 percent.
And the world population in the meantime has doubled.
That means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history.
And that is the result, directly, of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production.
And this is true, as you can see, for all countries, including the so-called developing countries.
What happened to our bread in the meantime?
As food became plentiful here, it also meant that we were able to decrease the number of people working in agriculture to something like, on average, in the high income countries, five percent or less of the population.
In the U.S. only one percent of the people are actually farmers.
And it frees us all up to do other things -- to sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food.
That is, historically, a really unique situation.
Never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people.
And never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact.
So as food became more plentiful, bread became cheaper.
And as it became cheaper, bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things.
We added in more sugar.
We add in raisins and oil and milk and all kinds of things to make bread, from a simple food into kind of a support for calories.
And today, bread now is associated with obesity, which is very strange.
It is the basic, most fundamental food that we've had in the last ten thousand years.
Wheat is the most important crop -- the first crop we domesticated and the most important crop we still grow today.
But this is now this strange concoction of high calories.
And that's not only true in this country, it is true all over the world.
Bread has migrated to tropical countries, where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava.
So bread has become from a main staple, a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity, of modern life.
And the whiter the bread, in many countries, the better it is.
So this is the story of bread as we know it now.
But of course the price of mass production has been that we moved large-scale.
And large-scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes, destruction of biodiversity -- still a lonely emu here in the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields.
The costs have been tremendous -- water pollution, all the things you know about, destruction of our habitats.
What we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about.
And this is where I have to query all of you.
How many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals?
How many of you actually can make a bread in this way, without starting with a bread machine or just some kind of packaged flavor?
Can you actually bake bread? Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs?
We have become very removed from what our bread really is, which, again, evolutionarily speaking, is very strange.
In fact not many of you know that our bread, of course, was not a European invention.
It was invented by farmers in Iraq and Syria in particular.
The tiny spike on the left to the center is actually the forefather of wheat.
This is where it all comes from, and where these farmers who actually, ten thousand years ago, put us on the road of bread.
Now it is not surprising that with this massification and large-scale production, there is a counter-movement that emerged -- very much also here in California.
The counter-movement says, "Let's go back to this.
Let's go back to traditional farming.
Let's go back to small-scale, to farmers' markets, small bakeries and all that." Wonderful.
Don't we all agree? I certainly agree.
I would love to go back to Tuscany to this kind of traditional setting, gastronomy, good food.
But this is a fallacy.
And the fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about.
If we do this, if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farming we are going, actually, to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands -- among whom I have lived for many years, working without electricity and water, to try to improve their food production -- we relegate them to poverty.
What they want are implements to increase their production: something to fertilize the soil, something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market.
We cannot just think that small-scale is the solution to the world food problem.
It's a luxury solution for us who can afford it, if you want to afford it.
In fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this.
If we say just small-scale production, as is the tendency here, to go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Rosling cannot even eat oranges anymore because in Scandinavia we don't have oranges.
So local food production is out.
But also we do not want to relegate to poverty in the rural areas.
And we do not want to relegate the urban poor to starvation.
So we must find other solutions.
One of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly -- doubling by about 2030.
The main driver of that is actually meat.
And meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particular is what drives the prices of cereals.
That need for animal protein is going to continue.
We can discuss alternatives in another talk, perhaps one day, but this is our driving force.
So what can we do?
Can we find a solution to produce more?
Yes. But we need mechanization.
And I'm making a real plea here.
I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice, 150,000 times, just to plant a crop and weed it.
You cannot ask people to work under these conditions.
We need clever low-key mechanization that avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we've had.
So what can we do?
We must feed three billion people in cities.
We will not do that through small farmers' markets because these people have no small farmers' markets at their disposal.
They have low incomes. And they benefit from cheap, affordable, safe and diverse food.
That's what we must aim for in the next 20 to 30 years.
But yes there are some solutions.
And let me just do one simple conceptual thing: if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale.
What you see is that we've started in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture, which was sort of small-scale and low-control.
We've moved towards large-scale and very high control.
What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields, but in terms of the entire food network.
That's where we should move.
And the ultimate may be, but it doesn't apply to cereals, that we have entirely closed ecosystems -- the horticultural systems right at the top left-hand corner.
So we need to think differently about agriculture science.
Agriculture science for most people -- and there are not many farmers among you here -- has this name of being bad, of being about pollution, about large-scale, about the destruction of the environment.
That is not necessary.
We need more science and not less. And we need good science.
So what kind of science can we have?
Well first of all I think we can do much better on the existing technologies.
Use biotechnology where useful, particularly in pest and disease resistance.
There are also robots, for example, who can recognize weeds with a resolution of half an inch.
We have much cleverer irrigation.
We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to.
And we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small-scale and large-scale.
We need to think that land is multi-functional.
It has different functions.
There are different ways in which we must use it -- for residential, for nature, for agriculture purposes.
And we also need to re-examine livestock.
Go regional and go to urban food systems.
I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements.
I want to have horticulture and greenhouses on top of residential areas.
And I want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses and from the fermentation of crops to heat our residential areas.
There are all kinds of ways we can do it.
We cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture.
But we can do a lot more.
And the main thing that I would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries, or as you stay here: ask your government for an integrated food policy.
Food is as important as energy, as security, as the environment.
Everything is linked together.
So we can do that. In fact in a densely populated country like the River Delta, where I live in the Netherlands, we have combined these functions.
So this is not science fiction. We can combine things even in a social sense of making the rural areas more accessible to people -- to house, for example, the chronically sick.
There is all kinds of things we can do.
But there is something you must do. It's not enough for me to say, "Let's get more bold science into agriculture."
You must go back and think about your own food chain.
Talk to farmers. When was the last time you went to a farm and talked to a farmer?
Talk to people in restaurants.
Understand where you are in the food chain, where your food comes from.
Understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events.
And that frees you up to do other things.
And above all, to me, food is about respect.
It's about understanding, when you eat, that there are also many people who are still in this situation, who are still struggling for their daily food.
And the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have, to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution, is really not morally justified.
We need to help to lift them out of poverty.
We need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive.
Never before, as I said, has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few.
And never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap.
And I think there is nobody else who has expressed better, to me, the idea that food, in the end, in our own tradition, is something holy.
It's not about nutrients and calories.
It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity.
Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi, 75 years ago, when he spoke about bread.
He did not speak about rice, in India. He said, "To those who have to go without two meals a day, God can only appear as bread."
And so as I'm finishing my bread here -- and I've been baking it, and I'll try not to burn my hands.
Let me share with those of you here in the first row.
Let me share some of the food with you.
Take some of my bread.
And as you eat it, and as you try it -- please come and stand up.
Have some of it.
I want you to think that every bite connects you to the past and the future: to these anonymous farmers, that first bred the first wheat varieties; and to the farmers of today, who've been making this. And you don't even know who they are.
Every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world.
Everything makes us so privileged, that we can eat this food, that we don't struggle every day.
And that, I think, evolutionarily-speaking is unique.
We've never had that before.
So enjoy your bread.
Eat it, and feel privileged.
Thank you very much.

<title>Louise Fresco: We need to feed the whole world</title>

I'm a neuroscientist, and I study decision-making.
I do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make.
I'm here to tell you the secret to successful decision-making: a cheese sandwich.
That's right. According to scientists, a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions.
How do I know? I'm the scientist who did the study.
A few years ago, my colleagues and I were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people's decisions in social situations.
Specifically, we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react when they're treated unfairly.
So we did an experiment.
We manipulated people's serotonin levels by giving them this really disgusting-tasting artificial lemon-flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain.
This is the amino acid tryptophan.
So what we found was, when tryptophan was low, people were more likely to take revenge when they're treated unfairly.
That's the study we did, and here are some of the headlines that came out afterwards.
At this point, you might be wondering, did I miss something?
Cheese? Chocolate? Where did that come from?
And I thought the same thing myself when these came out, because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate.
We gave people this horrible-tasting drink that affected their tryptophan levels.
But it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate.
And of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you make better decisions, well, that's sure to grab people's attention.
So there you have it: the evolution of a headline.
When this happened, a part of me thought, well, what's the big deal?
So the media oversimplified a few things, but in the end, it's just a news story.
And I think a lot of scientists have this attitude.
But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time, and it affects not just the stories you read in the news but also the products you see on the shelves.
When the headlines rolled, what happened was, the marketers came calling.
Would I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement of a mood-boosting bottled water?
Or would I go on television to demonstrate, in front of a live audience, that comfort foods really do make you feel better?
I think these folks meant well, but had I taken them up on their offers, I would have been going beyond the science, and good scientists are careful not to do this.
But nevertheless, neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing.
Here's one example: Neuro drinks, a line of products, including Nuero Bliss here, which according to its label helps reduce stress, enhances mood, provides focused concentration, and promotes a positive outlook.
I have to say, this sounds awesome.
I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago.
So when this came up in my local shop, naturally I was curious about some of the research backing these claims.
So I went to the company's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products.
But I didn't find any.
Trial or no trial, these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain.
And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties.
A couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article.
For half the people, the article included a brain image, and for the other half, it was the same article but it didn't have a brain image.
At the end — you see where this is going — people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article.
So this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image.
And this is how much they agree with the same article So the take-home message here is, do you want to sell it? Put a brain on it.
Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades, and we're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain.
Like, just a couple of weeks ago, neuroscientists at MIT figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain.
Really cool stuff.
But the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations and some overblown, unproven claims.
So what I'm going to do is show you how to spot a couple of classic moves, dead giveaways, really, for what's variously been called neuro-bunk, neuro-bollocks, or, my personal favorite, neuro-flapdoodle.
So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people's thoughts and emotions.
Here's a study published by a team of researchers as an op-ed in The New York Times.
The headline? "You Love Your iPhone. Literally."
It quickly became the most emailed article on the site.
So how'd they figure this out?
They put 16 people inside a brain scanner and showed them videos of ringing iPhones.
The brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula, a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion.
So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula, this meant the subjects loved their iPhones.
Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning, and that's that the insula does a lot.
Sure, it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion, but it's also involved in tons of other processes, like memory, language, attention, even anger, disgust and pain.
So based on the same logic, I could equally conclude you hate your iPhone.
The point here is, when you see activation in the insula, you can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation from off this list, and it's a really long list.
My colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published.
So chances are really, really good that your insula is going off right now, but I won't kid myself to think this means you love me.
So speaking of love and the brain, there's a researcher, known to some as Dr. Love, who claims that scientists have found the glue that holds society together, the source of love and prosperity.
This time it's not a cheese sandwich.
No, it's a hormone called oxytocin.
You've probably heard of it.
So, Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people's oxytocin, this increases their trust, empathy and cooperation.
So he's calling oxytocin "the moral molecule."
Now these studies are scientifically valid, and they've been replicated, but they're not the whole story.
Other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy. It increases gloating.
Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group at the expense of other groups.
And in some cases, oxytocin can even decrease cooperation.
So based on these studies, I could say oxytocin is an immoral molecule, and call myself Dr. Strangelove.
So we've seen neuro-flapdoodle all over the headlines.
We see it in supermarkets, on book covers.
What about the clinic?
SPECT imaging is a brain-scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain.
For the bargain price of a few thousand dollars, there are clinics in the U.S. that will give you one of these SPECT scans and use the image to help diagnose your problems.
These scans, the clinics say, can help prevent Alzheimer's disease, solve weight and addiction issues, overcome marital conflicts, and treat, of course, a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD.
This sounds great. A lot of people agree.
Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business.
There's just one problem.
The broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can't yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan.
But these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date, many of them children, and SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection, so exposing people to radiation, potentially harmful.
I am more excited than most people, as a neuroscientist, about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness and even maybe to make us better and smarter.
And if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate help us make better decisions, count me in.
But we're not there yet.
We haven't found a "buy" button inside the brain, we can't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans, and we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones.
Maybe someday we will, but until then, we have to be careful that we don't let overblown claims detract resources and attention away from the real science that's playing a much longer game.
So here's where you come in.
If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it, don't just take them at their word.
Ask the tough questions. Ask to see the evidence.
Ask for the part of the story that's not being told.
The answers shouldn't be simple, because the brain isn't simple.
But that's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway.
Thank you.

Space, we all know what it looks like.
We've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives, from the speculative images of science fiction to the inspirational visions of artists to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies.
But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space, we have no sense of what space sounds like.
And indeed, most people associate space with silence.
But the story of how we came to understand the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking.
And yet despite this, hardly any of us have ever heard space.
How many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star?
Well in case you've ever wondered, this is what the Sun sounds like.
This is the planet Jupiter.
And this is the space probe Cassini pirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn.
This is a a highly condensed clump of neutral matter, spinning in the distant universe.
So my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe.
And you may wonder, how do we know what these sounds are?
How can we tell the difference between the sound of the Sun and the sound of a pulsar?
Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy.
Radio astronomers study radio waves from space using sensitive antennas and receivers, which give them precise information about what an astronomical object is and where it is in our night sky.
And just like the signals that we send and receive here on Earth, we can convert these transmissions into sound using simple analog techniques.
And therefore, it's through listening that we've come to uncover some of the universe's most important secrets -- its scale, what it's made of and even how old it is.
So today, I'm going to tell you a short story of the history of the universe through listening.
It's punctuated by three quick anecdotes, which show how accidental encounters with strange noises gave us some of the most important information we have about space.
Now this story doesn't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft, but a rather more humble technology -- and in fact, the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution that we're all part of today: the telephone.
It's 1876, it's in Boston, and this is Alexander Graham Bell who was working with Thomas Watson on the invention of the telephone.
A key part of their technical set up was a half-mile long length of wire, which was thrown across the rooftops of several houses in Boston.
The line carried the telephone signals that would later make Bell a household name.
But like any long length of charged wire, it also inadvertently became an antenna.
Thomas Watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected.
Now you have to remember, this is 10 years before Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves -- 15 years before Nikola Tesla's four-tuned circuit -- nearly 20 years before Marconi's first broadcast.
So Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us.
We didn't have the technology to transmit.
So what were these strange noises?
Watson was in fact listening to very low-frequency radio emissions caused by nature.
Some of the crackles and pops were lightning, but the eerie whistles and curiously melodious chirps had a rather more exotic origin.
Using the very first telephone, Watson was in fact dialed into the heavens.
As he correctly guessed, some of these sounds were caused by activity on the surface of the Sun.
It was a solar wind interacting with our ionosphere that he was listening to -- a phenomena which we can see at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet as the aurora.
So whilst inventing the technology that would usher in the telecommunications revolution, Watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system emitted powerful radio waves.
He had accidentally been the first person to tune in to them.
Fast-forward 50 years, and Bell and Watson's technology has completely transformed global communications.
But going from slinging some wire across rooftops in Boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the Atlantic Ocean seabed is no easy matter.
And so before long, Bell were looking to new technologies to optimize their revolution.
Radio could carry sound without wires.
But the medium is lossy -- it's subject to a lot of noise and interference.
So Bell employed an engineer to study those noises, to try and find out where they came from, with a view towards building the perfect hardware codec, which would get rid of them so they could think about using radio for the purposes of telephony.
Most of the noises that the engineer, Karl Jansky, investigated were fairly prosaic in origin.
They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power.
But there was one persistent noise that Jansky couldn't identify, and it seemed to appear in his radio headset four minutes earlier each day.
Now any astronomer will tell you, this is the telltale sign of something that doesn't originate from Earth.
Jansky had made a historic discovery, that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves.
Fifty years on from Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun, Jansky's careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration: the radio astronomy age.
Over the next few years, astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers and learned about our radio sky, about Jupiter and the Sun, by listening.
Let's jump ahead again.
It's 1964, and we're back at Bell Labs.
And once again, two scientists have got a problem with noise.
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were using the horn antenna at Bell's Holmdel laboratory to study the Milky Way with extraordinary precision.
They were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity.
There was a glitch in their soundtrack.
A mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research.
It was in the microwave range, and it appeared to be coming from all directions simultaneously.
Now this didn't make any sense, and like any reasonable engineer or scientist, they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself, it must be the dish.
There were pigeons roosting in the dish.
And so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings, get the disk kind of operational again, normal operations would resume.
But the noise didn't disappear.
The mysterious noise that Penzias and Wilson were listening to turned out to be the oldest and most significant sound that anyone had ever heard.
It was cosmic radiation left over from the very birth of the universe.
This was the first experimental evidence that the Big Bang existed and the universe was born at a precise moment some 14.7 billion years ago.
So our story ends at the beginning -- the beginning of all things, the Big Bang.
This is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard -- the oldest sound that you're ever going to hear, the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the Big Bang.
Thanks.

So I didn't always make my living from music.
For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university, this was my day job.
I was a self-employed living statue called the 8-Foot Bride, and I love telling people l did this for a job, because everybody always wants to know, who are these freaks in real life?
Hello.
I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, put a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower and some intense eye contact.
And if they didn't take the flower, I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away.
So I had the most profound encounters with people, especially lonely people who looked like they hadn't talked to anyone in weeks, and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street, and we would sort of fall in love a little bit.
And my eyes would say, "Thank you. I see you."
And their eyes would say, "Nobody ever sees me. Thank you."
And I would get harassed sometimes.
People would yell at me from their passing cars.
"Get a job!"
And I'd be, like, "This is my job."
But it hurt, because it made me fear that I was somehow doing something un-joblike and unfair, shameful.
I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting for the music business on this box.
And for the economists out there, you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income, which was shocking to me given I had no regular customers, but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday, 90 bucks on a Friday.
It was consistent.
And meanwhile, I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band, the Dresden Dolls.
This was me on piano, a genius drummer.
I wrote the songs, and eventually we started making enough money that I could quit being a statue, and as we started touring, I really didn't want to lose this sense of direct connection with people, because I loved it.
So after all of our shows, we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people, and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us, and I would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows, and they would pass the hat, and then they would come in and join us onstage, so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird, random circus guests.
And then Twitter came along, and made things even more magic, because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere.
So I would need a piano to practice on, and an hour later I would be at a fan's house. This is in London.
People would bring home-cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us. This is in Seattle.
Fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig.
This is a library in Auckland.
On Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat, because I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast, and they showed up care of this dude, Chris from Newport Beach, who says hello.
I once tweeted, where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot?
And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in, and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death.
And I love this kind of random closeness, which is lucky, because I do a lot of couchsurfing.
In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there's no wireless, and in punk squats, everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless, clearly making it the better option.
My crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an 18-year-old girl, still living at home, and her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras.
And that night, her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds.
And I lay there thinking, these people have so little.
Is this fair?
And in the morning, her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible, and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English, "Your music has helped my daughter so much.
Thank you for staying here. We're all so grateful."
And I thought, this is fair.
This is this.
A couple months later, I was in Manhattan, and I tweeted for a crash pad, and at midnight, I'm ringing a doorbell on the Lower East Side, and it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone.
I've always been with my band or my crew.
Is this what stupid people do?
Is this how stupid people die?
And before I can change my mind, the door busts open.
She's an artist. He's a financial blogger for Reuters, and they're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath, and I have had thousands of nights like that and like that.
So I couchsurf a lot. I also crowdsurf a lot.
I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing.
You're falling into the audience and you're trusting each other.
I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get themselves some extra money, something that I did a lot.
And as usual, the band was psyched, but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn't bring himself to go out there.
It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat.
And I recognized his fear of "Is this fair?" and "Get a job."
And meanwhile, my band is becoming bigger and bigger.
We signed with a major label.
And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret.
It's not for everybody.
Well, maybe it's for you.
We sign, and there's all this hype leading up to our next record.
And it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies in the first few weeks, and the label considers this a failure.
And I was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?"
They were like, "No, the sales are going down. It's a failure."
And they walk off.
Right at this same time, I'm signing and hugging after a gig, and a guy comes up to me and hands me a $10 bill, and he says, "I'm sorry, I burned your CD from a friend."
"But I read your blog, I know you hate your label.
I just want you to have this money."
And this starts happening all the time.
I become the hat after my own gigs, but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people, and unlike the guy in the opening band, I've actually had a lot of practice standing there.
Thank you.
And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible, so it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad; Amanda Palmer over here, and I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing, but I'm going to ask for help, because I saw it work on the street.
So I fought my way off my label and for my next project with my new band, the Grand Theft Orchestra, I turned to crowdfunding, and I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made, and I asked my crowd to catch me.
And the goal was 100,000 dollars.
My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million, which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date.
And you can see how many people it is.
It's about 25,000 people.
And the media asked, "Amanda, the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy.
How did you make all these people pay for music?"
And the real answer is, I didn't make them. I asked them.
And through the very act of asking people, I'd connected with them, and when you connect with them, people want to help you.
It's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists.
They don't want to ask for things.
But it's not easy. It's not easy to ask.
And a lot of artists have a problem with this.
Asking makes you vulnerable.
And I got a lot of criticism online after my Kickstarter went big for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices, specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer, and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website.
And this hurt in a really familiar way.
And people saying, "You're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help," really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling, "Get a job."
Because they weren't with us on the sidewalk, and they couldn't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd, an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them.
So this is slightly not safe for work.
This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin.
At the end of the night, I stripped and let everyone draw on me.
Now let me tell you, if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers, I recommend this, especially if those strangers are drunk German people.
This was a ninja master-level fan connection, because what I was really saying here was, I trust you this much.
Should I? Show me.
For most of human history, musicians, artists, they've been part of the community, connectors and openers, not untouchable stars.
Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance, but the Internet and the content that we're freely able to share on it are taking us back.
It's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough.
So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price.
They see it as an unpredictable risk, but the things I've done, the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell, I don't see these things as risk.
I see them as trust.
Now, the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street, they're getting there.
But the perfect tools aren't going to help us if we can't face each other and give and receive fearlessly, but, more important, to ask without shame.
My music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box, so blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers, our mistakes, and we see each other.
And I think when we really see each other, we want to help each other.
I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question, which is, "How do we make people pay for music?"
What if we started asking, "How do we let people pay for music?"
Thank you.

I'm actually here to make a challenge to people.
I know there have been many challenges made to people.
The one I'm going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace really means.
Peace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord."
Peace is not the dove and the rainbow -- as lovely as they are.
When I see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove, I think of personal serenity.
I think of meditation.
I do not think about what I consider to be peace, which is sustainable peace with justice and equality.
It is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives, where these people have enough access to education and health care, so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear.
This is called human security.
And I am not a complete pacifist like some of my really, really heavy-duty, non-violent friends, like Mairead McGuire.
I understand that humans are so "messed up" -- to use a nice word, because I promised my mom I'd stop using the F-bomb in public.
And I'm trying harder and harder.
Mom, I'm really trying.
We need a little bit of police; we need a little bit of military, but for defense.
We need to redefine what makes us secure in this world.
It is not arming our country to the teeth.
It is not getting other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them.
It is using that money more rationally to make the countries of the world secure, to make the people of the world secure.
I was thinking about the recent ongoings in Congress, where the president is offering 8.4 billion dollars to try to get the START vote.
I certainly support the START vote.
But he's offering 84 billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons.
Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals is 80 billion dollars?
Just that little bit of money, which to me, I wish it was in my bank account -- it's not, but ...
In global terms, it's a little bit of money.
But it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime, unless we get up off our ...
and take action to make it happen, unless we begin to believe that all of the things that we've been hearing about in these last two days are elements of what come together to make human security.
It is saving the tigers.
It is stopping the tar sands.
It is having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have cancer.
It is all of those things.
It is using our money for all of those things.
It is about action.
I was in Hiroshima a couple of weeks ago, and His Holiness -- we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city, and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates.
And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church.
We're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak, and he leans over to me, and he says, "Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk."
I said, "Yes, Your Holiness.
Your robe gives it away."
He said, "You know that I kind of like meditation, and I pray."
I said, "That's good. That's good.
We need that in the world.
I don't follow that, but that's cool."
And he says, "But I have become skeptical.
I do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world.
I think what we need is action."
His Holiness, in his robes, is my new action hero.
I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi a couple of days ago.
As most of you know, she's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma.
You probably also know that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years imprisoned for her efforts to bring about democracy.
She was just released a couple of weeks ago, and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free, because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon, agitating for change.
She is already out in the streets, working with the party to try to rebuild it.
But I talked to her for a range of issues.
But one thing that I want to say, because it's similar to what His Holiness said.
She said, "You know, we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country.
But I don't believe in hope without endeavor.
I don't believe in the hope of change, unless we take action to make it so."
Here's another woman hero of mine.
She's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi, the first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
She has been in exile for the last year and a half.
You ask her where she lives -- where does she live in exile?
She says the airports of the world.
She is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections.
And instead of going home, she conferred with all the other women that she works with, who said to her, "Stay out. We need you out.
We need to be able to talk to you out there, so that you can give the message of what's happening here."
A year and a half -- she's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country.
Wangari Maathai -- 2004 Peace laureate.
They call her the "Tree Lady," but she's more than the Tree Lady.
Working for peace is very creative.
It's hard work every day.
When she was planting those trees, I don't think most people understand that, at the same time, she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country.
People could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail.
But if they were together planting trees for the environment, it was okay -- creativity.
But it's not just iconic women like Shirin, like Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai -- it is other women in the world who are also struggling together to change this world.
The Women's League of Burma, 11 individual organizations of Burmese women came together because there's strength in numbers.
Working together is what changes our world.
The Million Signatures Campaign of women inside Burma working together to change human rights, to bring democracy to that country.
When one is arrested and taken to prison, another one comes out and joins the movement, recognizing that if they work together, they will ultimately bring change in their own country.
Mairead McGuire in the middle, Betty Williams on the right-hand side -- bringing peace to Northern Ireland.
I'll tell you the quick story.
An IRA driver was shot, and his car plowed into people on the side of the street.
There was a mother and three children.
The children were killed on the spot.
It was Mairead's sister.
Instead of giving in to grief, depression, defeat in the face of that violence, Mairead hooked up with Betty -- a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic -- and they took to the streets to say, "No more violence."
And they were able to get tens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men, in the streets to bring about change.
And they have been part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland, and they're still working on it, because there's still a lot more to do.
This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum.
She also received the Peace Prize.
She is now running for president.
She is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy, about how you bring democracy to the country, about educating, about how to vote -- but that democracy is not just about voting; it's about being an active citizen.
That's what I got stuck doing -- the landmine campaign.
One of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two NGOs to thousands in 90 countries around the world, working together in common cause to ban landmines.
Some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month.
They could maybe volunteer that much.
There were others, like myself, who were full-time.
But it was the actions, together, of all of us that brought about that change.
In my view, what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace.
It's not a dirty word.
It's hard work every single day.
And if each of us who cares about the different things we care about got up off our butts and volunteered as much time as we could, we would change this world, we would save this world.
And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.
Thank you.

I'm talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation, the third-largest organized crime, a $10 billion industry.
I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery.
I'd like to tell you the story of these three children, Pranitha, Shaheen and Anjali.
Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution, a prostituted person.
She got infected with HIV, and towards the end of her life, when she was in the final stages of AIDS, she could not prostitute, so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker.
By the time we got the information, we reached there, Pranitha was already raped by three men.
Shaheen's background I don't even know.
We found her in a railway track, raped by many, many men, I don't know many.
But the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body.
And when we took her to the hospital she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body.
We still don't know who her parents are, who she is.
All that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally.
Anjali's father, a drunkard, sold his child for pornography.
You're seeing here images of three years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.
In this country, and across the globe, hundreds and thousands of children, as young as three, as young as four, are sold into sexual slavery.
But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for.
They are sold in the name of adoption.
They are sold in the name of organ trade.
They are sold in the name of forced labor, camel jockeying, anything, everything.
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation.
And I tell you stories from there.
My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager.
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.
I don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it.
Yes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me, but that didn't go into my consciousness.
I never felt like a victim, then or now.
But what lingered from then till now -- I am 40 today -- is this huge outrageous anger.
Two years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated, because I was a victim.
And that's what we do to all traffic survivors.
We, as a society, we have PhDs in victimizing a victim.
Right from the age of 15, when I started looking around me, I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery-like practices, but have absolutely no respite, because we don't allow them to come in.
Where does their journey begin?
Most of them come from very optionless families, not just poor.
You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.
I had this I.S. officer's daughter, who is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard, who was raped chatting with one individual, and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine, who was trafficked.
I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families, and children from well-to-do families, who are getting trafficked.
These people are deceived, forced.
99.9 percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution.
Some pay the price for it.
They're killed; we don't even hear about them.
They are voiceless, [unclear], nameless people.
But the rest, who succumb into it, go through everyday torture.
Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends, or who want to have a family with you.
These are men who buy you for an hour, for a day, and use you, throw you.
Each of the girls that I have rescued -- I have rescued more than 3,200 girls -- each of them tell me one story in common ...
one story about one man, at least, putting chili powder in her vagina, one man taking a cigarette and burning her, one man whipping her.
We are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers, uncles, cousins, all around us.
And we are silent about them.
We think it is easy money.
We think it is shortcut.
We think the person likes to do what she's doing.
But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it, substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.
And one day she gives up on you and me, because we have no options for her.
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.
She believes, "Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about."
And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day.
And it's abnormal to live in a shelter.
It's abnormal to get rehabilitated.
It's in that context that I work.
It's in that context that I rescue children.
I've rescued children as young as three years, and I've rescued women as old as 40 years.
When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had was where do I begin.
Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected.
One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive.
And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain.
And for me, I was my greatest experience.
Understanding my own self, understanding my own pain, my own isolation, was my greatest teacher.
Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential.
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder.
She works for a very big company, a workshop in Hyderabad, making furnitures.
She earns around 12,000 rupees.
She is an illiterate girl, trained, skilled as a welder.
Why welding and why not computers?
We felt, one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage.
They did not have any pardas inside their body, hijabs inside themselves; they've crossed the barrier of it.
And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world, very easily, and not feel very shy about it.
We have trained girls as carpenters, as masons, as security guards, as cab drivers.
And each one of them are excelling in their chosen field, gaining confidence, restoring dignity, and building hopes in their own lives.
These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons.
What has been my challenge?
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up.
I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.
I can't hear from my right ear.
I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue.
My biggest challenge is society.
It's you and me.
My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own.
A very supportive friend of mine, a well-wisher of mine, used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables.
When her mother fell sick she said, "Sunitha, you have so much of contacts.
Can you get somebody in my house to work, so that she can look after my mother?"
And there is a long pause.
And then she says, "Not one of our girls."
It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking, in this fantastic A-C hall.
It's very nice for discussion, discourse, making films and everything.
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes.
It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.
It's not nice for our children to study with their children.
There it ends.
That's my biggest challenge.
If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan.
I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.
They need your compassion.
They need your empathy.
They need, much more than anything else, your acceptance.
Many times when I talk to people, I keep telling them one thing: don't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem.
Can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem?
And that's what I'm here for, asking for your support, demanding for your support, requesting for your support.
Can you break your culture of silence?
Can you speak to at least two persons about this story?
Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons.
I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars, or something like that.
I'm asking you, in your limited world, can you open your minds? Can you open your hearts?
Can you just encompass these people too?
Because they are also a part of us.
They are also part of this world.
I'm asking you, for these children, whose faces you see, they're no more.
They died of AIDS last year.
I'm asking you to help them, accept as human beings -- not as philanthropy, not as charity, but as human beings who deserve all our support.
I'm asking you this because no child, no human being, deserves what these children have gone through.
Thank you.

Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?
You know, in a dictionary? Yeah, that's what I thought.
How about this word?
Here, I'll show it to you.
Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.
Notice -- we're very specific -- that word "compile."
The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite, out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.
It's little discrete -- that's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits.
And those bits are words.
Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer -- besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words, like lexicographical.
Lexicographical has this great pattern: it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl, I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red.
But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy."
Right? It's a fun word to say, and I get to say it a lot.
Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.
Right? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.
But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.
Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.
But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary, and keep the bad words out.
But the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.
For one thing, I just do not do uniforms.
And for another, deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy.
And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun, you kind of look for an excuse not to do them.
So if I had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.
I want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.
But why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?
Well, I blame the Queen.
Why do I blame the Queen?
Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.
But secondly, I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed.
Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.
The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened in American dictionaries since 1965.
So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.
James Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.
So he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today.
When a guy who looks like that, in that hat, is the face of modernity, you have a problem.
And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.
There'd be virtually no learning curve.
And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!
Computers! What about computers?
The thing about computers is, I love computers.
I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.
I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.
But computers don't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries.
They don't change the end result.
Because what a dictionary is, is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.
It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.
You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!
The design has not changed.
And OK, what about online dictionaries, right?
Online dictionaries must be different.
This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.
This is my favorite word, by the way.
Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.
Very useful word. So, look at that.
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.
This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!
Right? Those little buttons, I had them all expanded except for the date chart.
So there's not very much going on here.
There's not a lot of clickiness.
And in fact, online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print, except for searchability.
And when you improve searchability, you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.
Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for, because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.
So -- -- now, when you think about this, what we have here is a ham butt problem.
Does everyone know the ham butt problem?
Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.
She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away, and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like, "This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?"
She thought, "Well, my mom always did this."
So she calls up mom, and she says, "Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?"
She says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"
So they call grandma, and grandma says, "My pan was too small!"
So, it's not that we have good words and bad words.
We have a pan that's too small!
You know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.
The bad words -- see, when people think about a place and they don't find a place on the map, they think, "This map sucks!"
When they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook, they're like, "Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook."
When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think, "This must be a bad word." Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.
Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?
So, you can't get a smaller ham.
The English language is as big as it is.
So, if you have a ham butt problem, and you're thinking about the ham butt problem, the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive: paper is the enemy of words.
How can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.
Some of my best friends are books.
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.
Now they're going to think "Oh, boy.
People are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?"
No. There will still be paper dictionaries.
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation, we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.
You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries, but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.
The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.
So, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint, artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.
What if biologists could only study animals that made people go, "Aww." Right?
What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals, and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?
We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna, and not very much about much else.
And I think this is a problem.
I think we should study all the words, because when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts.
Lexicography is really more about material science.
We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression: your speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me, "Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?"
They think, "OK, if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts, how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?"
They're just the right tools for the job.
And so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?"
You know, anybody who's read a children's book knows that love makes things real.
If you love a word, use it. That makes it real.
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.
It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.
If you love a word, it becomes real.
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic, if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less about control and more about description, then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile.
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes, is touched, any time you touch a word, you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation, you verb it, you make the mobile move.
You didn't break it. It's just in a new position, and that new position can be just as beautiful.
Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop -- the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection, or the cars get confused. Right?
But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic, but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.
You can ask for help!
If you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help.
Library of Congress: 17 million books, of which half are in English.
If only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it, that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.
And I find an un-dictionaried word -- a word like "un-dictionaried," for example -- in almost every book I read. What about newspapers?
Newspaper archive goes back to 1759, 58.1 million newspaper pages. If only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it, it would be an entire other OED.
That's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.
And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs -- and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time.
There's a lot going on there.
And I'm not even talking about polysemy, which is the greedy habit some words have of taking So if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow, a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff, and there's one numbered definition in the OED.
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.
Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.
One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses."
Do you know what that says to me?
That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub.
That's a lexicographical cop out, to say, "miscellaneous technical senses."
So, we have all these words, and we really need help!
And the thing is, we could ask for help -- asking for help's not that hard.
I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.
See, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers, and this is more of a visual explanation.
If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language, these bright spots are what we know about, and the dark spots are where we are in the dark.
If that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.
And we don't even know the shape of the language.
If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English -- look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida, but there's no California!
We're missing California from American English.
We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.
We don't even see that there's a gap on the map.
So again, lexicography is not rocket science.
But even if it were, rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days. You know?
It can't be that hard to find some words!
So, enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.
For instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings.
And then, ornithologists can go and help track populations, migrations, etc.
And there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.
He's a director of an electroplating company.
He's found more than 140 comets.
He's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.
It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.
I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.
But he found 140 comets without a telescope.
He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite, and that's how he found them.
If we can find comets without a telescope, shouldn't we be able to find words?
Now, y'all know where I'm going with this.
Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.
And the Internet is great for collecting words, because the Internet's full of collectors.
And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet, but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.
And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now, but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.
They show the word, but they don't show any context.
Where did it come from? Who said it?
What newspaper was it in? What book?
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact.
If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact, it's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.
So a word without its source is like a cut flower.
You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.
It dies too fast.
So, this whole time I've been saying, "The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."
Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because, well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.
They use it synecdochically.
And one of the problems of knowing a word like "synecdochically" is that you really want an excuse to say "synecdochically."
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.
So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language, or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country -- then you're using it synecdochically.
But the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.
If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.
We can put in all the meanings.
Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language.
You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son, who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.
This is what dictionaries used to look like.
I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.
It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.
It wasn't really what people needed.
And the thing is, if we can put in all the words, no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad, we can really describe the language like scientists.
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.
If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing, and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.
Thank you very much for your kind attention.

<title>Erin McKean: The joy of lexicography</title>
<description>Is the beloved paper dictionary doomed to extinction? In this infectiously exuberant talk, leading lexicographer Erin McKean looks at the many ways today's print dictionary is poised for transformation.</description>
<keywords>book,culture,education,entertainment,language</keywords>

I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on involving a man named Steve Titus.
Titus was a restaurant manager.
He was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington, he was engaged to Gretchen, about to be married, she was the love of his life.
And one night, the couple went out for a romantic restaurant meal.
They were on their way home, and they were pulled over by a police officer.
You see, Titus' car sort of resembled a car that was driven earlier in the evening by a man who raped a female hitchhiker, and Titus kind of resembled that rapist.
So the police took a picture of Titus, they put it in a photo lineup, they later showed it to the victim, and she pointed to Titus' photo.
She said, "That one's the closest."
The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial, and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape, the rape victim got on the stand and said, "I'm absolutely positive that's the man."
And Titus was convicted.
He proclaimed his innocence, his family screamed at the jury, his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing, and Titus is taken away to jail.
So what would you do at this point?
What would you do?
Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system, and yet he got an idea.
He called up the local newspaper, he got the interest of an investigative journalist, and that journalist actually found the real rapist, a man who ultimately confessed to this rape, a man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes in that area, and when this information was given to the judge, the judge set Titus free.
And really, that's where this case should have ended.
It should have been over.
Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year, a year of accusation and trial, but over.
It didn't end that way.
Titus was so bitter.
He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.
He lost his fiancée.
She couldn't put up with his persistent anger.
He lost his entire savings, and so he decided to file a lawsuit against the police and others whom he felt were responsible for his suffering.
And that's when I really started working on this case, trying to figure out how did that victim go from "That one's the closest" to "I'm absolutely positive that's the guy."
Well, Titus was consumed with his civil case.
He spent every waking moment thinking about it, and just days before he was to have his day in court, he woke up in the morning, doubled over in pain, and died of a stress-related heart attack.
He was 35 years old.
So I was asked to work on Titus' case because I'm a psychological scientist.
I study memory. I've studied memory for decades.
And if I meet somebody on an airplane -- this happened on the way over to Scotland -- if I meet somebody on an airplane, and we ask each other, "What do you do? What do you do?"
and I say "I study memory," they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names, or they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's or some kind of memory problem, but I have to tell them I don't study when people forget.
I study the opposite: when they remember, when they remember things that didn't happen or remember things that were different from the way they really were.
I study false memories.
Unhappily, Steve Titus is not the only person to be convicted based on somebody's false memory.
In one project in the United States, information has been gathered on 300 innocent people, 300 defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do.
They spent 10, 20, 30 years in prison for these crimes, and now DNA testing has proven that they are actually innocent.
And when those cases have been analyzed, three quarters of them are due to faulty memory, faulty eyewitness memory.
Well, why?
Like the jurors who convicted those innocent people and the jurors who convicted Titus, many people believe that memory works like a recording device.
You just record the information, then you call it up and play it back when you want to answer questions or identify images.
But decades of work in psychology has shown that this just isn't true.
Our memories are constructive.
They're reconstructive.
Memory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page: You can go in there and change it, but so can other people.
I first started studying this constructive memory process in the 1970s.
I did my experiments that involved showing people simulated crimes and accidents and asking them questions about what they remember.
In one study, we showed people a simulated accident and we asked people, how fast were the cars going when they hit each other?
And we asked other people, how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?
And if we asked the leading "smashed" question, the witnesses told us the cars were going faster, and moreover, that leading "smashed" question caused people to be more likely to tell us that they saw broken glass in the accident scene when there wasn't any broken glass at all.
In another study, we showed a simulated accident where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign, and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign, many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign at the intersection, not a stop sign.
And you might be thinking, well, you know, these are filmed events, they are not particularly stressful.
Would the same kind of mistakes be made with a really stressful event?
In a study we published just a few months ago, we have an answer to this question, because what was unusual about this study is we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience.
The subjects in this study were members of the U.S. military who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise to teach them what it's going to be like for them if they are ever captured as prisoners of war.
And as part of this training exercise, these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive, hostile, physically abusive fashion for 30 minutes and later on they have to try to identify the person who conducted that interrogation.
And when we feed them suggestive information that insinuates it's a different person, many of them misidentify their interrogator, often identifying someone who doesn't even remotely resemble the real interrogator.
And so what these studies are showing is that when you feed people misinformation about some experience that they may have had, you can distort or contaminate or change their memory.
Well out there in the real world, misinformation is everywhere.
We get misinformation not only if we're questioned in a leading way, but if we talk to other witnesses who might consciously or inadvertently feed us some erroneous information, or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced, all of these provide the opportunity for this kind of contamination of our memory.
In the 1990s, we began to see an even more extreme kind of memory problem.
Some patients were going into therapy with one problem -- maybe they had depression, an eating disorder -- and they were coming out of therapy with a different problem.
Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations, sometimes in satanic rituals, sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements.
One woman came out of psychotherapy believing that she'd endured years of ritualistic abuse, where she was forced into a pregnancy and that the baby was cut from her belly.
But there were no physical scars or any kind of physical evidence that could have supported her story.
And when I began looking into these cases, I was wondering, where do these bizarre memories come from?
And what I found is that most of these situations involved some particular form of psychotherapy.
And so I asked, were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy -- like the imagination exercises or dream interpretation, or in some cases hypnosis, or in some cases exposure to false information -- were these leading these patients to develop these very bizarre, unlikely memories?
And I designed some experiments to try to study the processes that were being used in this psychotherapy so I could study the development of these very rich false memories.
In one of the first studies we did, we used suggestion, a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases, we used this kind of suggestion and planted a false memory that when you were a kid, five or six years old, you were lost in a shopping mall.
You were frightened. You were crying.
You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person and reunited with the family.
And we succeeded in planting this memory in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects.
And you might be thinking, well, that's not particularly stressful.
But we and other investigators have planted rich false memories of things that were much more unusual and much more stressful.
So in a study done in Tennessee, researchers planted the false memory that when you were a kid, you nearly drowned and had to be rescued by a life guard.
And in a study done in Canada, researchers planted the false memory that when you were a kid, something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal happened to you, succeeding with about half of their subjects.
And in a study done in Italy, researchers planted the false memory, when you were a kid, you witnessed demonic possession.
I do want to add that it might seem like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects in the name of science, but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation by research ethics boards that have made the decision that the temporary discomfort that some of these subjects might experience in these studies is outweighed by the importance of this problem for understanding memory processes and the abuse of memory that is going on in some places in the world.
Well, to my surprise, when I published this work and began to speak out against this particular brand of psychotherapy, it created some pretty bad problems for me: hostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists, who felt under attack, and by the patients whom they had influenced.
I had sometimes armed guards at speeches that I was invited to give, people trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired.
But probably the worst was I suspected that a woman was innocent of abuse that was being claimed by her grown daughter.
She accused her mother of sexual abuse based on a repressed memory.
And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story to be filmed and presented in public places.
I was suspicious of this story, and so I started to investigate, and eventually found information that convinced me that this mother was innocent.
I published an exposé on the case, and a little while later, the accusing daughter filed a lawsuit.
Even though I'd never mentioned her name, she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.
And I went through nearly five years of dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation, but finally, finally, it was over and I could really get back to my work.
In the process, however, I became part of a disturbing trend in America where scientists are being sued for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy.
When I got back to my work, I asked this question: if I plant a false memory in your mind, does it have repercussions?
Does it affect your later thoughts, your later behaviors?
Our first study planted a false memory that you got sick as a child eating certain foods: hard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.
And we found that once we planted this false memory, people didn't want to eat the foods as much at an outdoor picnic.
The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant.
If we planted a warm, fuzzy memory involving a healthy food like asparagus, we could get people to want to eat asparagus more.
And so what these studies are showing is that you can plant false memories and they have repercussions that affect behavior long after the memories take hold.
Well, along with this ability to plant memories and control behavior obviously come some important ethical issues, like, when should we use this mind technology?
And should we ever ban its use?
Therapists can't ethically plant false memories in the mind of their patients even if it would help the patient, but there's nothing to stop a parent from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.
And when I suggested this publicly, it created an outcry again.
"There she goes. She's advocating that parents lie to their children."
Hello, Santa Claus.
I mean, another way to think about this is, which would you rather have, a kid with obesity, diabetes, shortened lifespan, all the things that go with it, or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory?
I know what I would choose for a kid of mine.
But maybe my work has made me different from most people.
Most people cherish their memories, know that they represent their identity, who they are, where they came from.
And I appreciate that. I feel that way too.
But I know from my work how much fiction is already in there.
If I've learned anything from these decades of working on these problems, it's this: just because somebody tells you something and they say it with confidence, just because they say it with lots of detail, just because they express emotion when they say it, it doesn't mean that it really happened.
We can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories.
We need independent corroboration.
Such a discovery has made me more tolerant of the everyday memory mistakes that my friends and family members make.
Such a discovery might have saved Steve Titus, the man whose whole future was snatched away by a false memory.
But meanwhile, we should all keep in mind, we'd do well to, that memory, like liberty, is a fragile thing.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks very much.

Hi. Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects, done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.
We call ourselves Pors and Rao, and we live and work in India.
I'd like to begin with my very first object, which I call "The Uncle Phone."
And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him, almost like I were an extension of his body -- to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water, a pack of cigarettes.
And as I grew up, it became worse and worse, And I started to think of it as a form of control.
But of course, I could never say anything, because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family.
And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone.
He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.
And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle, I made him "The Uncle Phone."
It's so long that it requires two people to use it.
It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person.
But the problem is that, when I left home and went to college, I started missing his commands.
And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email.
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage, type his email or command and pull the paper out.
This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email.
So here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital.
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.
And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism, the way my uncle likes it.
The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call "The Pygmies."
And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.
So how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall, and behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.
And as soon as it's silent, they sort of creep out.
And if it's even more silent, they stretch their necks out.
And at the slightest sound, they hide back again.
So we had these panels on three walls of a room.
And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.
So this is how it works.
This is a video prototype.
So when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.
And they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.
So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.
And they don't react to background sounds.
You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to.
But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.
So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible.
So each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche, mood swings, personalities and so on.
So this is a very early prototype.
Of course, it got much better after that.
And we made them react to people, but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.
This is a video installation called "The Missing Person."
And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility.
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?
So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance, and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us, using a camera that could look at people in the room, track them and replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible.
So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype.
On the right side you can see my colleague Soren, who's actually in the space.
And on the left side, you'll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible.
Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.
And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.
It's a very early video, so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that, but that got refined pretty soon, later.
So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space, and we had one monitor, one on each wall.
And as people walked into the room, they would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference: one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room.
So this is a work called "The Sun Shadow."
And it was almost like a sheet of paper, like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun.
And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust, and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.
So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it, thinking it was some crap laying around.
But as soon as they passed by, it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.
And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.
So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man.
His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts, that it's sort of fallen into his hat, and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.
Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.
And it's kind of constrained by that circle.
Because if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even, it would start to wander about in the space.
And there's no wires.
So I'll just show you an instance -- so when people enter the room, it activates this object.
And it very slowly, over a few minutes, sort of painfully goes up, and then it gains momentum and it looks like it's almost about to fall.
And this is an important moment, because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.
But it doesn't really need it, because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.
So this work was a real technical challenge for us, and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.
And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall, because if we made it in a way that it would topple over, then it would damage itself, and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism, or that sense of wanting to go and help it.
So I'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario -- it's much faster.
That's my colleague. He's let it go.
Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.
But he doesn't need to, because it manages to lift itself up on its own.
So this is a work that we were very intrigued with, working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.
And it's at the scale of the night sky.
So we wrapped this around a blob-like form, which is in the shape of a teddy bear, which was hanging from the ceiling.
And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear, which is very comforting and intimate.
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space, and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.
So this is the last work, and a work in progress, and it's called "Space Filler."
Well imagine a small cube that's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room, and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it -- almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something.
So we work with a lot of technology, but we don't really love technology, because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.
But we use it because we're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create.
And once a creature pops into our minds, it's almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move.
Thank you.

Both myself and my brother belong to the under 30 demographic, which Pat said makes 70 percent, but according to our statistics it makes 60 percent of the region's population.
Qatar is no exception to the region.
It's a very young nation led by young people.
We have been reminiscing about the latest technologies and the iPods, and for me the abaya, my traditional dress that I'm wearing today.
Now this is not a religious garment, nor is it a religious statement.
Instead, it's a diverse cultural statement that we choose to wear.
Now I remember a few years ago, a journalist asked Dr. Sheikha, who's sitting here, president of Qatar University -- who, by the way, is a woman -- he asked her whether she thought the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way.
Her answer was quite the contrary.
Instead, she felt more free, more free because she could wear whatever she wanted under the abaya.
She could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care.
Not that you do; I'm just saying.
My point is here, people have a choice -- just like the Indian lady could wear her sari or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono.
We are changing our culture from within, but at the same time we are reconnecting with our traditions.
We know that modernization is happening.
And yes, Qatar wants to be a modern nation.
But at the same time we are reconnecting and reasserting our Arab heritage.
It's important for us to grow organically.
And we continuously make the conscious decision to reach that balance.
In fact, research has shown that the more the world is flat, if I use Tom Friedman's analogy, or global, the more and more people are wanting to be different.
And for us young people, they're looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves.
Which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global.
We don't want to be all the same, but we want to respect each other and understand each other.
And therefore tradition becomes more important, not less important.
Life necessitates a universal world, however, we believe in the security of having a local identity.
And this is what the leaders of this region are trying to do.
We're trying to be part of this global village, but at the same time we're revising ourselves through our cultural institutions and cultural development.
I'm a representation of that phenomenon.
And I think a lot of people in this room, I can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself.
And I'm sure, although we can't see the people in Washington, they are in the same position.
We're continuously trying to straddle different worlds, different cultures and trying to meet the challenges of a different expectation from ourselves and from others.
So I want to ask a question: What should culture in the 21st century look like?
In a time where the world is becoming personalized, when the mobile phone, the burger, the telephone, everything has its own personal identity, how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others?
How does that impact our desert culture?
I'm not sure of how many of you in Washington are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region and, the more recent, Museum of Islamic Art opened in Qatar in 2008.
I myself am personalizing these cultural developments, but I also understand that this has to be done organically.
Yes, we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions, but what I think is more important is that we are very fortunate to have visionary leaders who understand that this can't happen from outside, it has to come from within.
And guess what?
You might be surprised to know that most people in the Gulf who are leading these cultural initiatives happen to be women.
I want to ask you, why do you think this is?
Is it because it's a soft option; we have nothing else to do?
No, I don't think so.
I think that women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally.
It's a natural component for bringing people together, discussing ideas -- in the same way we're doing here at TED.
We're here, we're part of a community, sharing out ideas and discussing them.
Art becomes a very important part of our national identity.
The existential and social and political impact an artist has on his nation's development of cultural identity is very important.
You know, art and culture is big business.
Ask me.
Ask the chairpersons and CEOs of Sotheby's and Christie's.
Ask Charles Saatchi about great art.
They make a lot of money.
So I think women in our society are becoming leaders, because they realize that for their future generations, it's very important to maintain our cultural identities.
Why else do Greeks demand the return of the Elgin Marbles?
And why is there an uproar when a private collector tries to sell his collection to a foreign museum?
Why does it take me months on end to get an export license from London or New York in order to get pieces into my country?
In few hours, Shirin Neshat, my friend from Iran who's a very important artist for us will be talking to you.
She lives in New York City, but she doesn't try to be a Western artist.
Instead, she tries to engage in a very important dialogue about her culture, nation and heritage.
She does that through important visual forms of photography and film.
In the same way, Qatar is trying to grow its national museums through an organic process from within.
Our mission is of cultural integration and independence.
We don't want to have what there is in the West.
We don't want their collections.
We want to build our own identities, our own fabric, create an open dialogue so that we share our ideas and share yours with us.
In a few days, we will be opening the Arab Museum of Modern Art.
We have done extensive research to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists, and Arabs who are not Muslims -- not all Arabs are Muslims, by the way -- but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution.
This institution is government-backed and it has been the case for the past three decades.
We will open the museum in a few days, and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways and come and join us.
Now this museum is just as important to us as the West.
Some of you might have heard of the Algerian artist Baya Mahieddine, but I doubt a lot of people know that this artist worked in Picasso's studio in Paris in the 1930s.
For me it was a new discovery.
And I think with time, in the years to come we'll be learning a lot about our Picassos, our Legers and our Cezannes.
We do have artists, but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet.
Now visual expression is just one form of culture integration.
We have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of YouTube and social networking to express their stories, share their photos and tell their own stories through their own voices.
In a similar way, we have created the Doha Film Institute.
Now the Doha Film Institute is an organization to teach people about film and filmmaking.
Last year we didn't have one Qatari woman filmmaker.
Today I am proud to say we have trained and educated over 66 Qatari women filmmakers to edit, tell their own stories in their own voices.
Now if you'll allow me, I would love to share a one-minute film that has proven to show that a 60-sec film can be as powerful as a haiku in telling a big picture.
And this is one of our filmmakers' products.
Boy: Hey listen! Did you know that the stocks are up?
Who are you playing?
Girl: Uncle Khaled. Here, put on the headscarf.
Khaled: Why would I want to put it on?
Girl: Do as you're told, young girl.
Boy: No, you play mom and I play dad.
Play by yourself then.
Girl: Women! One word and they get upset.
Useless.
Thank you. Thank you!
SM: Going back to straddling between East and West, last month we had our second Doha Tribeca Film Festival here in Doha.
The Doha Tribeca Film Festival was held at our new cultural hub, Katara.
It attracted 42,000 people, and we showcased 51 films.
Now the Doha Tribeca Film Festival is not an imported festival, but rather an important festival between the cities of New York and Doha.
It's important for two things.
First, it allows us to showcase our Arab filmmakers and voices to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, New York City.
At the same time, we are inviting them to come and explore our part of the world.
They're learning our culture, our language, our heritage and realizing we're just as different and just the same as each other.
Now over and over again, people have said, "Let's build bridges," and frankly, I want to do more than that.
I would like break the walls of ignorance between East and West -- no, not the soft option that we have discussed before, but rather the soft power that Joseph Nye has spoken about before.
Culture's a very important tool to bring people together.
We should not underestimate it.
"Know thyself," that is the journey of self-expression and self-realization that we are traveling.
Now I don't pretend to have all the answers, but I know that me as an individual and we as a nation welcome this community of ideas worth spreading.
This is a very interesting journey.
I welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions.
Familiarity destroys and trumps fear. Try it.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Shokran.

<title>Sheikha Al Mayassa: Globalizing the local, localizing the global</title>
<description>Sheikha Al Mayassa, a patron of artists, storytellers and filmmakers in Qatar, talks about how art and culture create a country's identity -- and allow every country to share its unique identity with the wider world. As she says: "We don't want to be all the same, but we do want to understand each other."</description>

Good morning everyone. First of all, it's been fantastic being here over these past few days.
And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people, these amazing talks that we've had.
I feel that I've fitted in, in many ways, to some of the things that I've heard.
I came directly here from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador, where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane -- with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses, where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies, and keep the roads, out of their forests.
They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated, a world that isn't polluted.
And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in with what we're all talking about here at TED, is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest, was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador -- and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn't have to go down.
The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries, they were able to store a lot of electricity.
So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses in this little community -- could have light for, I think it was about half an hour each evening.
And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer.
And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back, and he was saying, "You know, we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man 50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers, and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world.
We want to know about health care.
We want to know about what other people do -- we're interested in it.
And we want to learn other languages.
We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese, and we're good at languages."
So there he is with his little laptop computer, but fighting against the might of the pressures -- because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador -- fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil.
And so, coming directly from there to here.
But, of course, my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization -- I can't really call it a civilization.
A different way of life, a different being.
We've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world -- but the world is not composed only of human beings; there are also other animal beings.
And I propose to bring into this TED conference, as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom.
Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film, but these beings have voices that mean something.
And so, I want to give you a greeting, as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania -- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
I've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960.
During that time, there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work.
For example, for the first time, a few years ago, by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done -- so for the first time, we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant.
Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society.
So this opens up a whole new avenue of research.
And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI -- to determine the range of the chimps.
And we're using -- you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff -- but we're using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area.
And of course, there's developments in infrared, so you can watch animals at night, and equipment for recording by video, and tape recording is getting lighter and better.
So in many, many ways, we can do things today that we couldn't do when I began in 1960.
Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals with large brains, are studied in captivity, modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals.
So that we know today, they're capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began.
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan -- her name means love -- and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her.
She loves her computer -- she'll leave her big group, and her running water, and her trees and everything.
And she'll come in to sit at this computer -- it's like a video game for a kid; she's hooked.
She's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans.
She does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them, but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn't like making mistakes.
If she has a bad run, and her score isn't good, she'll come and reach up and tap on the glass -- because she can't see the experimenter -- which is asking to have another go.
And her concentration -- she's already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again, just for the satisfaction of having done it better.
And the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward, like one raisin for a correct response -- but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand.
So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer.
Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language.
But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 -- I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday -- the first time, when I was going through the vegetation, the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part, although some were a little bit acclimatized -- and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound, and I peered with my binoculars.
It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard -- and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps; they should all have numbers; that was more scientific.
Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest.
And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves -- modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose -- the beginning of tool-making.
The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time, it was thought that humans, and only humans, used and made tools.
When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.
So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news, he said, "Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,' or accept chimpanzees as humans."
We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.
Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa, wherever chimps have been studied, there are completely different tool-using behaviors.
And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture.
What we find is that over these 40-odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals with complex brains and social systems, we have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.
It's a very wuzzy line.
It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human.
The chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives -- but they have this long childhood, five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother, and then another three, four or five years of emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born.
The importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible -- and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society.
The long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother, with the brothers and sisters, and which can last through a lifetime, which may be up to 60 years.
They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity, so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far.
And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism.
We find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich -- they have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances, but they also use touch, posture, gesture, and what do they do?
They kiss; they embrace; they hold hands.
They pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist -- the kind of things that we do, and they do them in the same kind of context.
They have very sophisticated cooperation.
Sometimes they hunt -- not that often, but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation, and they share the prey.
We find that they show emotions, similar to -- maybe sometimes the same -- as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair.
They know mental as well as physical suffering.
And I don't have time to go into the information save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities, studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals.
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- "self" as opposed to "other."
They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.
But this teaches us a new respect -- and it's a new respect not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest, but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet.
Once we're prepared to admit that after all, we're not the only beings with personalities, minds and above all feelings, and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet, it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me.
So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees -- who've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility -- are in the wild, disappearing very fast.
They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well.
The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land.
They're disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear-cutting.
They're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads -- as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched -- to take out oil or timber.
And this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world, to what is known as the bush-meat trade.
This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is, in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families -- now, suddenly, because of the roads, the hunters can go in from the towns.
They shoot everything, every single thing that moves that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it.
And now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it.
And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called, than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred.
And it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who've lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted.
They're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money.
Their culture is being destroyed, along with the animals upon whom they depend.
So, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left.
We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity, and I've seen it happening with my own eyes.
And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa, and what do we see in Africa?
We see deforestation; we see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger; we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support, and they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere.
Were the people that we heard about yesterday, on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid?
Didn't they know what was happening?
Of course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn't a question of "Let's leave the tree for tomorrow."
"How am I going to feed my family today?
Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer, and then we'll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end."
So, this is a pretty grim picture.
The one thing we have, which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures, is this sophisticated spoken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren't here.
We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future, discuss ideas with each other, so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group.
We can do it by talking to each other; we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word.
And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards, and we're destroying the world.
In the developed world, in a way, it's worse, because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we're doing.
Do you know, we're bringing little babies into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them?
And the air is harming them, and the food that's grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them.
And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere.
Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago?
And so many of these diseases, like asthma and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped.
We're harming ourselves around the world, as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself -- Mother Nature, that brought us into being; Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time, where there's trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development.
And yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature, because they're growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality, with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun, or in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks coming down from the canopy above.
As I was traveling around the world, you know, I had to leave the forest -- that's where I love to be.
I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because, finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now, I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world.
And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight, the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected, and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world, and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense, hope lies in sense, you said -- it's making a nonsense.
How can we do it?
Somebody said that yesterday.
And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope.
They were feeling despair, they were feeling, "Well, it doesn't matter what we do; eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.
Everything is hopeless -- we're always being told so by the media."
And then I met some who were angry, and anger that can turn to violence, and we're all familiar with that.
And I have three little grandchildren, and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university, they'd say, "We're angry," or "We're filled with despair, because we feel you've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it."
And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren, and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age.
I feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania, I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots.
There's little brochures all around outside, and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future, I beg that you pick up that brochure.
And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope.
Roots make a firm foundation.
Shoots seem tiny, but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls.
See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet.
Then, you see, it is a message of hope.
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through, and can make this a better world.
And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference.
Every individual has a role to play.
Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday, and you scientists know that you can't actually -- even if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo, and things like that -- you're making a difference in the world.
So, the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects.
And these are projects to make the world around them a better place.
One project to show care and concern for your own human community.
One for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say, I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty, who was my childhood companion.
And the third kind of project: something for the local environment.
So what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they -- and we go now from pre-school right through university.
It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural.
It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished.
It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in.
We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York.
It's going to depend on which country they're in -- and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups -- and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves.
Why?
Because they're buying into it, and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do.
It isn't something that their parents tell them, or their teachers tell them.
That's effective, but if they decide themselves, "We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there.
We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden.
We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories.
We want to go and work in a dog shelter.
We want to learn about animals. We want ... " You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me.
As I travel around the world 300 days a year, everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages.
Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying, "Look at the difference we've made."
And now comes the technology into it, because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world.
And if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas but we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement.
But also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair, to say, "We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?"
And then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel, saying, "Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it."
The philosophy is very simple.
We do not believe in violence.
No violence, no bombs, no guns.
That's not the way to solve problems.
Violence leads to violence, at least in my view.
So how do we solve?
The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding.
Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture.
Hard work and persistence --don't give up -- and love and compassion leading to respect for all life.
How many more minutes? Two, one?
One -- one to two.
Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two.
Are you going to come and drag me off?
Anyway -- so basically, Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people's lives.
It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to.
And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact, not just because you can share technology with us, but because so many of you have children.
And if you take this program out, and give it to your children, they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good, because they've got parents like you.
And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place.
It's very encouraging.
But the kids do ask me -- and this won't take more than two minutes, I promise -- the kids say, "Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future?
You travel, you see all these horrible things happening."
Firstly, the human brain -- I don't need to say anything about that.
Now that we know what the problems are around the world, human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems.
And we've talked a lot about that.
Secondly, the resilience of nature.
We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life.
We can see a whole area desolated, and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help.
And thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last, talked about the indomitable human spirit.
We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible.
Nelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years, and came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath.
Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York and I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage, so much love and so much compassion.
And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more, in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and I was trying to encourage them, somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi, "If you look back through human history, you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good."
And just after that a woman brought me this little bell, and I want to end on this note.
She said, "If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this.
This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine, from the killing fields of Pol Pot -- one of the most evil regimes in human history -- where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled.
So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?
Is it out there with the politicians?
It's in our hands.
It's in your hands and my hands and those of our children.
It's really up to us.
We're the ones who can make a difference.
If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints, if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not, we can change the world overnight.
Thank you.

<title>Jane Goodall: What separates us from chimpanzees?</title>
<description>Jane Goodall hasn't found the missing link, but she's come closer than nearly anyone else. The primatologist says the only real difference between humans and chimps is our sophisticated language. She urges us to start using it to change the world.</description>
<keywords>Africa,Featured,animals,culture,environment,global issues,nature,primates,science</keywords>

I was informed by this kind of unoriginal and trite idea that new technologies were an opportunity for social transformation, which is what drove me then, and still, it's a delusion that drives me now.
I wanted to update what I've been doing since then -- but it's still the same theme song -- and introduce you to my lab and current work, which is the Environmental Health Clinic that I run at NYU.
And what it is -- it's a twist on health.
Because, really, what I'm trying to do now is redefine what counts as health.
It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university, except people come to the clinic with environmental health concerns, and they walk out with prescriptions for things they can do to improve environmental health, as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals.
It's a handy-dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath that says, "The greater part of the soul lays outside the body, treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer."
But that suggests the issue that I'm trying to get at here, that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health.
Because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error.
And I would use this study, a recent study by Philip Landrigan, to motivate a different view of health, where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan and the New York area and logged what they spent their patient hours on.
80 to 90 percent of their time was spent on five things.
Number one was asthma, number two was developmental delays, number three was 400-fold increases in rare childhood cancers in the last eight to 10, 15 years.
Number four and five were childhood obesity and diabetes-related issues.
So all of those -- what's common about all of those?
The environment is implicated, radically implicated, right.
This is not the germs that medicos were trained to deal with; this is a different definition of health, health that has a great advantage because it's external, it's shared, we can do something about it, as opposed to internal, genetically predetermined or individualized.
People who come to the clinic are called, not patients, but impatients, because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change to address local and environmental health issues.
And I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices that I set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face.
I like this one from the Belgian field office, where we met in a roundabout, precisely because the roundabout iconified the headless social movement that informs much social transformation, as opposed to the top-down control of red light traffic intersections.
In this case, of course, the roundabout with that micro-decisions being made in situ by people not being told what to do.
But, of course, affords greater throughput, fewer accidents, and an interesting model of social movement.
Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed: this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol, or keeping tabs, if you will.
What they are is an addition of tadpoles that are named after a local bureaucrat whose decisions affect your water quality.
So an impatient concern for water quality would raise a tadpole bureaucrat in a sample of water in which they're interested.
And we give them a couple of things to do that, to help them do companion animal devices while they're blogging and doing their email.
This is a tadpole walker to take your tadpole walking in the evening.
And the interesting thing that happens -- because we're using tadpoles, of course, because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have, several orders of magnitude more sensitive than some of our senses for sensing, responding in a biologically meaningful way, to that whole class of industrial contaminants we call endocrine disruptors or hormone emulators.
But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening -- there's a few action shots -- your neighbors are likely to say, "What are you doing?"
And then you have to introduce your tadpole and who it's named after.
You have to explain what you're doing and how the developmental events of a tadpole are, of course, very observable and they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do.
And so next time your neighbor sees you they'll say, "How is that tadpole doing?"
And you can let them social network with your tadpole, because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site for, not only impatients, humans, but non-humans, social networking for humans and non-humans.
And of course, these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic, the obesity epidemic, the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things.
The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole, observing the behavioral and developmental events, you will then go and introduce your tadpole to its namesake and discuss the evidence that you've seen.
Another quick protocol -- and I'm going to go through these quickly, but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here -- instead of asking you for urine samples, I'll ask you for a mouse sample.
Anyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse -- a domestic partnership with mice?
Very lucky.
Mice, of course, are the quintessential model organism.
They're even better models of environmental health, because not only the same mammalian biology, but they share your diet, largely.
They share your environmental stressors, the asbestos levels and lead levels, whatever you're exposed to.
And they're geographically more limited than you are, because we don't know if you've been exposed to persistent organic pollutants in your home, or occupationally or as a child.
Mice are a very good representation.
So it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course.
This is one of them.
Coping with environmental stressors is tricky.
Is anybody here on antidepressants?
There's a lot of people in Manhattan are.
And we were testing if the mice would also self-administer SSRIs.
So this was Prozac, this was Zoloft, this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant, all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking.
So do you think the mice self-administered antidepressants?
What's the -- How did you know that? They did.
This was vodka and solution, gin and solution.
This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant.
Where's our export?
Vodka, gin -- Yes. Yes. You know your mice well.
They did, yes.
So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water, which was interesting.
Then of course, it goes into the entrapment device.
There's an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cellphones -- which dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse.
We take the blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice.
And I want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way.
But we do have a few prescription products through this.
It's very different from the medical model.
Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality, or to understand it or to change it, the benefits are enjoyed by anyone you share that water quality or air quality with.
And that aggregating effect, that collective action effect, is actually something we can use to our advantage.
So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic called the No Park.
This is a prescription to improve water quality.
Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality.
What we do is we take a fire hydrant, a "no parking" space associated with a fire hydrant, and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt to create an engineered micro landscape, to create an infiltration opportunity.
Because, many of you will know, that the biggest pollution burden that we have on the New York, New Jersey harbor right now is no longer the point sources, no longer the big polluters, no longer the GEs, but that massive network of roads, [those] impervious surfaces, that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners or the oily hydrocarbon waste in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure washes it straight into the estuary system.
That doesn't do a lot of good.
These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants before they enter the harbor, and they're produced by impatients on various city blocks in some very interesting ways.
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though, there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block.
By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them, we don't prevent them from being used as emergency vehicle parking spaces, because, of course, a firetruck can come and park there.
They flatten a few plants. No big deal, they'll regenerate.
But if we did this in every single -- every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency.
That 99 percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there, it's infiltrating pollutants.
It's also increasing fixing CO2s, sequestering some of the airborne pollutants.
And aggregated, these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system, up to a seven inch rain event, up to a hundred-year storm.
So these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health.
This is one of the more ambitious ones.
What the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secondary, more insidious and more pervasive crisis, which is the crisis of agency, which is what to do.
Somehow buying a local lettuce, changing a light bulb, driving the speed limit, changing your tires regularly, doesn't seem sufficient in the face of climate crisis.
And this is an interesting icon that happened -- you remember these: fallout shelters.
What is the fallout shelter for the climate crisis?
This was civic mobilization.
Churches, school groups, hospitals, private residents -- everyone built one of these in a matter of months.
And they still remain as icons of civic response in the face of shared, uncertain, collective threat.
Fallout shelter for the climate crisis, I would say, looks something like this, or this, which is an intensive urban agriculture facility that's due to go on my lab building at NYU.
What it does is a very simple idea of taking -- 80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan is building related -- we take, just like a commercial greenhouse, we take the CO2 from the building -- CO2-enriched air -- we force it through the urban agriculture facility, and then we resupply oxygen-enriched air.
You can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that.
So it's on legs, so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns.
It's built as a barn raising, using open source hardware.
This is the quarter-scale prototype that was functioning in Spain.
This is what it will look like, fingers crossed, NYU willing.
And what I want to show you is -- actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing -- which is a solar chimney -- we have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment -- that passively draws air up.
You understand a solar chimney.
Hot air rises.
You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building, it'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow.
What we do is actually put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that.
That actually removes about 95 percent of the carbon black, that stuff that, with ozone, is responsible for about half of global warming's effects, because it changes, it settles on the snow, it changes the reflectors, it changes the transmission qualities of the atmosphere.
Carbon black is that grime that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs, and it's associated with.
It's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion, not from combustion itself.
When we put it through our solar chimney, we remove actually about 95 percent of that.
And then I swap it out with the students and actually re-release that carbon black.
And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we've pulled out of the air.
Here's one of them that we have up now.
Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users.
Okay, so I want to show you just two more interfaces, because I think one of our big challenges is re-imagining our relationship to natural systems, not only through this model of twisted personalized health, but through the animals with whom we cohabit.
We are not alone; the animals are moving in.
In fact, urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild into urban centers.
You know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal, elk in Westchester County.
It's happening all over the Developed World, probably for loss of habitat, but also because our cities are a little bit more livable than they have been.
And every green space we create is an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us.
But we've kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly.
And I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces that have been developed under the moniker of OOZ -- which is zoo backwards and without cages -- to try and reform that relationship.
This is communication technology for birds. I looks like this.
When a bird lands on it, they trigger a sound file.
This is actually in the Whitney Museum, where there were six of them, each of which had a different argument on it, different sound file.
They said things like this.
Recorded Voice: Here's what you need to do.
Go down there and buy some of those health food bars, the ones you call bird food, and bring it here and scatter it around.
There's a good person.
Natalie Jeremijenko: Okay.
So there was several of these.
The birds were able to jump from one to the other.
These are just your average urban pigeon.
And an early test which argument elicited cooperative behavior from the people below -- about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us.
Recorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick.
That's the sound of genetic mutations of the avian flu becoming a deadly human flu.
Do you know what slows it down?
Healthy sub-populations of birds, increasing biodiversity generally.
It is in your interests that I'm healthy, happy, well-fed.
Hence, you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them.
That is, share your lunch.
NJ: It worked, and it's true.
The final project I'd like to show you is a new interface for fish that has just been launched -- it's actually officially launched next week -- with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League.
You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish, but there is now a device for you to do so.
It looks like this: buoys that float on the water, project three foot up, three foot down.
When a fish swims underneath, a light goes on.
This is what it looks like.
So there's another function on here.
This top light is -- I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick -- this top light is actually a water quality display that shifts from red, when the dissolved oxygen is low, to a blue/green, when its dissolved oxygen is high.
And then you can also text the fish.
So there's business cards down there that'll give you contact details.
And they text back.
When the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message.
But perhaps the most popular has been that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River, where the first beaver -- crazy as he is -- to have moved in and built a lodge in New York in 250 years, hangs out.
So updates from a beaver.
You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him.
And what I like to think of is this is an interface that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems, specifically by changing who has information, where they have it, who can make sense of that information, and what you can do about it.
In this case, instead of throwing chewing gum, or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city, and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution, it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds.
Instead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish.
They're delicious.
They're cross-species delicious that is, delicious for humans and non-humans.
But they also have a chelating agent in them.
They're nutritionally appropriate, not like Doritos.
And so every time that desire to interact with the animals, which is at least as ubiquitous as that sign: "Do not feed the animals."
And there's about three of them on every New York City park.
And Yellowstone National Park, there's more "do not feed the animals" signs than there are animals you might wish to feed.
But in that action, that interaction, by re-scripting that, by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate, that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent, which, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally, binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it's complexed by a reactive, effectively removing it from bioavailability.
But I wanted to say that interaction, re-scripting that interaction, into collective action, collective remediative action, very different from the approach that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River, where we're dredging the PCBs -- after 30 years of legislative and legal struggle, GE's paying for the dredging of the largest Superfund site in the world -- we're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania or the nearest Third World country, where it will continue to be toxic sludge.
Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues.
And that's typically the paradigm under which we've operated.
By actually taking the opportunity that new technologies, new interactive technologies, present to re-script our interactions, to script them, not just as isolated, individuated interactions, but as collective aggregating actions that can amount to something, we can really begin to address some of our important environmental challenges.
Thank you.

So I grew up in East Los Angeles, not even realizing I was poor.
My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets.
Everyone knew who I was, so I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected, and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail, I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.
She worked at the local high school as a secretary in the dean's office, so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class, for whatever reason, who were waiting to be disciplined.
Man, her office was packed.
So, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school, and sometimes we're just not ready to focus.
But that doesn't mean that we can't.
It just takes a little bit more.
Like, I remember one day I found my dad convulsing, foaming at the mouth, OD-ing on the bathroom floor.
Really, do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list?
Not so much.
But I really needed a support network, a group of people who were going to help me make sure that I wasn't going to be a victim of my own circumstance, that they were going to push me beyond what I even thought I could do.
I needed teachers, in the classroom, every day, who were going to say, "You can move beyond that."
And unfortunately, the local junior high was not going to offer that.
It was gang-infested, huge teacher turnover rate.
So my mom said, "You're going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day."
So for the next two years, that's what I did.
I took a school bus to the fancy side of town.
And eventually, I ended up at a school where there was a mixture.
There were some people who were really gang-affiliated, and then there were those of us really trying to make it to high school.
Well, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable.
You had to survive.
You just had to do things sometimes.
So there were a lot of teachers who were like, "She's never going to make it.
She has an issue with authority.
She's not going to go anywhere."
Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause.
But then, they were very surprised when I graduated from high school.
I was accepted to Pepperdine University, and I came back to the same school that I attended to be a special ed assistant.
And then I told them, "I want to be a teacher."
And boy, they were like, "What? Why?
Why would you want to do that?"
So I began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that I attended, and I really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me.
And so every year, I share my background with my kids, because they need to know that everyone has a story, everyone has a struggle, and everyone needs help along the way.
And I am going to be their help along the way.
So as a rookie teacher, I created opportunity.
I had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before.
I was like, "You need to go to a hospital, the school nurse, something."
He's like, "No, Miss, I'm not going.
I need to be in class because I need to graduate."
So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance, but we were going to push forward and keep moving on.
And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they're going through, getting to know their families -- I wanted that, but I couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids, and teachers turning over year after year after year.
How do you get to build those relationships?
So we created a new school.
And we created the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media.
And we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding, for support.
But with that, we were going to gain freedom: freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective; freedom to control the curriculum so that we're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five, no; and freedom to control a budget, to spend money where it matters, not how a district or a state says you have to do it.
We wanted those freedoms.
But now, shifting an entire paradigm, it hasn't been an easy journey, nor is it even complete.
But we had to do it.
Our community deserved a new way of doing things.
And as the very first pilot middle school in all of Los Angeles Unified School District, you better believe there was some opposition.
And it was out of fear -- fear of, well, what if they get it wrong?
Yeah, what if we get it wrong?
But what if we get it right?
And we did.
So even though teachers were against it because we employ one-year contracts -- you can't teach, or you don't want to teach, you don't get to be at my school with my kids.
So in our third year, how did we do it?
Well, we're making school worth coming to every day.
We make our kids feel like they matter to us.
We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them, and they use all the technology that they're used to.
Laptops, computers, tablets -- you name it, they have it.
Animation, software, moviemaking software, they have it all.
And because we connect it to what they're doing — For example, they made public service announcements for the Cancer Society.
These were played in the local trolley system.
Teaching elements of persuasion, it doesn't get any more real than that.
Our state test scores have gone up more than 80 points since we've become our own school.
But it's taken all stakeholders, working together -- teachers and principals on one-year contracts, working over and above and beyond their contract hours without compensation.
And it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say, "Know, the district is trying to impose this, but you have the freedom to do otherwise."
And it takes an active parent center who is not only there, showing a presence every day, but who is part of our governance, making decisions for their kids, our kids.
Because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live?
They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood, a school that they can be proud to say they attend, and a school that the community can be proud of as well, and they need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances.
Because it's time that kids like me stop being the exception, and we become the norm.
Thank you.

The AlloSphere: it's a three-story metal sphere in an echo-free chamber.
Think of the AlloSphere as a large, dynamically varying digital microscope that's connected to a supercomputer.
20 researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere, and be completely immersed in their data.
Imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin.
Imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material.
Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain, as though it was a world, and see tissues as landscapes, and hear blood density levels as music.
This is some of the research that you're going to see that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere.
But first a little bit about this group of artists, scientists, and engineers that are working together.
I'm a composer, orchestrally-trained, and the inventor of the AlloSphere.
With my visual artist colleagues, we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space, visually and sonically.
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information.
And our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration.
I'm going to fly you into five research projects in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin.
This first project is called the AlloBrain.
And it's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful.
You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain.
Our narrative here is real fMRI data that's mapped visually and sonically.
The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with.
You see 12 intelligent computer agents, the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you.
They're mining blood density levels.
And they're reporting them back to you sonically.
Higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain.
They're actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities.
We're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation.
In this artistic and scientific installation, biogenerative algorithms are helping us to understand self-generation and growth: very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences.
For artists, we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore.
These generative algorithms grow over time, and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects.
Our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code, which are computer programs, that allow these creatures to grow over time.
We're going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world, down into the atomic world, as we fly into a lattice of atoms.
This is real AFM -- Atomic Force Microscope -- data from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center.
They've discovered a new bond, a new material for transparent solar cells.
We're flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms -- oxygen, hydrogen and zinc.
You view the bond in the triangle.
It's four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom.
You see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists.
This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms.
We think it makes a beautiful structural art.
The sound that you're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms.
We've mapped them into the audio domain, so they're singing to you.
Oxygen, hydrogen and zinc have their own signature.
We're going to actually move even further down as we go from this lattice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom.
We're working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the n-dimensional Schrödinger equation in time.
What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom.
You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines.
The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration.
In a minute we're going to move to a two-orbital configuration, and you're going to notice a pulsing.
And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound.
This is actually a light emitter.
As the sound starts to pulse and contract, our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted.
They're starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations.
And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics.
We're going to move even further down, and go to one single electron spin.
This will be the final project that I show you.
Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin.
We've taken this information and we've made a mathematical model out of it.
You're actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow.
This is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology.
So these brief examples that I've shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing at the University of California, Santa Barbara, to bring together, arts, science and engineering into a new age of math, science and art.
We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere.
Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara.
Thank you very much.

When I knew I was going to come to speak to you, I thought, "I gotta call my mother."
I have a little Cuban mother -- she's about that big.
Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.
You still with me?
I called her up.
"Hello, how're you doing, baby?"
"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you."
"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?"
I said, "I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people."
"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went to the White House."
"Ma, don't start!"
And I told her I was coming to TED, and she said, "What's the problem?"
And I said, "Well, I'm not sure."
I said, "I have to talk to them about stories.
It's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'" And she said, "Well, you design a story when you make it up, it's entertainment when you tell it, and you're going to use a microphone."
I said, "You're a peach, ma. Pop there?"
"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?"
Then my pop got on there.
My pop, he's one of the old souls, you know -- old Cuban man from Camaguey.
Camaguey is a province in Cuba.
He's from Florida.
He was born there in 1924.
He grew up in a bohio of dirt floors, and the structure was the kind used by the Tainos, our old Arawak ancestors.
My father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny, and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.
"Papi, help."
"I already heard your mother. I think she's right."
"After what I just told you?"
My whole life, my father's been there.
So we talked for a few minutes, and he said, "Why don't you tell them what you believe?"
I love that, but we don't have the time.
Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to.
Great story is the art of letting go.
So I'm going to tell you a little story.
Remember, this tradition comes to us not from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still, before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus, or we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves.
Back then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.
When Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.
Have you been watching the commercials?
Because every one of us has this desire, for once -- just once -- to tell our story and have it heard.
There are stories you tell from stages.
There's stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine.
And there's stories you tell late at night to a friend, maybe once in your life.
And then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness.
I'm not telling you that story.
I'm telling you this one.
It's called, "You're Going to Miss Me."
It's about human connection.
My Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch, came to the United States one thousand years ago.
I was born in 19 -- I forget, and I came to this country with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution.
We went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.
And Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.
And in that little Southern town, I grew up, and grew up hearing these stories.
But this story only happened a few years ago.
I called my mom.
It was a Saturday morning.
And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal.
It's delicious. It's savory.
It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth -- is that enough? It makes your armpits juicy, you know?
That kind of food, yeah.
This is the sensory part of the program, people.
I called my mother, and she said, "Carmen, I need you to come, please.
I need to go to the mall, and you know your father now, he takes a nap in the afternoon, and I got to go.
I got an errand to run."
Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you -- Esther, my mother, had stopped driving several years ago, to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta.
Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child, guys, naturally included flashing, blue lights.
But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue, and when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well, rapport.
"Ma'am, did you know that was a light you just ran?"
"You don't speak English?"
"No."
But eventually, every dog has its day, and she ended up in traffic court, where she bartered with the judge for a discount.
There's a historical marker.
But now she was a septuagenarian, she'd stopped driving.
And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed, you know, that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit, you know, same color as the Buick.
Anybody? All right.
Little picks on the legs, where she does her needlepoint, and leaves little loops.
Rockports -- they're for this.
That's why they call them that.
This is her ensemble.
And this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning when I have a lot to do, but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing.
I'm not going political on you but ... And so, I go to my mother's.
I show up. She's in the carport.
Of course, they have a carport.
The kind with the corrugated roof, you know.
The Buick's parked outside, and she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys.
"I got a surprise for you, baby!"
"We taking your car?"
"Not we, I."
And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe.
Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me.
Oh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license.
Issued, evidently, by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett.
Blithering fucking idiots.
I said, "Is that thing real?"
"I think so."
"Can you even see?"
"I guess I must."
"Oh, Jesus."
She gets into the car -- she's sitting on two phone books.
I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny.
She's engineered an umbrella so she can -- bam! -- slam the door.
Her daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream cone in the middle of her forehead, is still standing there, slack-jawed.
"You coming? You no coming?"
"Oh, my God." I said, "OK, fine. Does pop know you're driving?"
"Are you kidding me?"
"How are you doing it?"
"He's got to sleep sometime."
And so we left my father fast asleep, because I knew he'd kill me if I let her go by herself, and we get in the car.
Puts it in reverse. Fifty-five out of the driveway, in reverse.
I am buckling in seatbelts from the front.
I'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots.
I mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert.
I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about?
And she's whistling, and finally I do the kind of birth breathing -- you know, that one?
Only a couple of women are going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Right.
And I said, "Ma, would you slow down?"
Because now she's picked up the Highway 285, the perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now -- there's seven lanes, she's on all of them, y'all.
I said, "Ma, pick a lane!"
"They give you seven lanes, they expect you to use them."
And there she goes, right.
I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped.
So, I think, hey, we can talk. It'll be a diversion.
It'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse, maybe.
"Mommy, I know you have been stopped."
"No, no, what you talking about?"
"You have a license. How long have you been driving?"
"Four or five days."
"Yeah. And you haven't been stopped?"
"I did not get a ticket."
I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on."
"OK, so I stopped at a light and there's a guy, you know, in the back."
"Would this guy have, like, a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face?"
"You weren't there, don't start."
"Come on. You got a ticket?"
"No." She explained, "The man" -- I have to tell you as she did, because it loses something if I don't, you know -- "he come to the window, and he does a thing like this, which tells me he's pretty old, you know.
So I look up and I'm thinking, maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute."
"Ma, are you still doing that?"
"If it works, it works, baby.
So, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.' Well, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps."
So he's talking to her, and at some point she says, "Then, you know, it was it. That was it. It was done."
"Yeah? What?
He gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?"
"No, I look up, and the light, she change."
You should be terrified.
Now, I don't know if she's toying with me, kind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse -- left paw, right paw, left paw, right paw -- but by now, we've reached the mall.
Now, you have all been at a mall during the holidays, yes?
Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes.
Audience: Yes.
Carmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory, praying to that saint of perpetual availability that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along, some guy's going to turn on the brake lights just as you pull up behind him.
But that doesn't happen most of the time, right?
So, first I say, "Ma, why are we here?"
"You mean, like, in the car?"
"No, don't -- why are we here today?
It's Saturday. It's the holidays."
"Because I have to exchange your father's underwear."
Now, see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking, that you really have to -- you know, in my mind, it's a rabbit's warren, this woman's mind.
Do I want to walk in, because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor -- enough metaphors for you? -- somewhere, I may not get out.
But you know.
"Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now?
And why? What is wrong with his underwear?"
"It will upset you."
"It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?"
"No, no, no. The only thing with him is, he's an idiot.
I sent him to the store, which was my first mistake, and he went to buy underwear, and he bought the grippers, and he's supposed to buy the boxers."
"Why?"
"I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children."
"Oh, my God!"
Olivia? Huh? Huh?
By now, we have now crawled another four feet, and my mother finally says to me, "I knew it, I knew it.
I'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you? Right there."
And she points out the passenger window, and I look out, and three -- three -- aisles down, "Look, the Chevy."
You want to laugh, but you don't know -- you're that politically corrected, have you noticed?
Correct the other direction now, it's OK.
"Look, the Chevy -- he's coming this way."
"Mama, mama, mama, wait, wait, wait. The Chevy is three aisles away."
She looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child, the cretin, the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly.
"I know that, honey. Get out of the car and go stand in the parking space till I get there."
OK, I want a vote. Come on, come on. No, no.
How many of you once in your -- you were a kid, you were an adult -- you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone?
See, we're a secret club with a secret handshake.
And years of therapy later, we're doing great.
We're doing great. We're doing fine.
Well, I stood up to her.
This is -- you know, you'd think by now I'm -- and still holding?
I said, "No way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life."
Of course, her comeback is, "When have I embarrassed you?"
And she's still talking while she puts the car in park, hits the emergency brake, opens the door, and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age, she jumps out of the car, knocks out the phone books, and then she walks around -- she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her -- around the front of the car.
She has amazing land speed for a woman her age, too.
Before I know it, she has skiddled across the parking lot and in between the cars, and people behind me, with that kind of usual religious charity that the holidays bring us, wah-wah wah-wah.
"I'm coming." Italian hand signals follow.
I scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books.
This is new and fast, just so you -- are you still with us?
We'll wait for the slow ones. OK.
I start, and this is where a child says to me -- and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before, because this is my laconic child.
A brevity, brevity of everything with this child.
You know, she eats small portions.
Language is something to be meted out in small phonemes, you know -- just little hmm, hmm-hmm.
She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen.
She wields great power.
She listens, because that's what people who tell stories do first.
But she pauses occasionally and says, "How do you spell that? What year? OK."
When she writes the expose in about 20 years, don't believe a word of it.
But this is my daughter, Lauren, my remarkable daughter, my borderline Asperger's kid.
Bless you, Dr. Watson.
She says, "Ma, you got to look!"
Now, when this kid says I got to look, you know.
But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before.
I grew up with this woman.
I said, "Lauren, you know what, give me a play-by-play. I can't."
"No, mama, you got to look."
I got to look. You got to look.
Don't you want to look?
There she is.
I look in bewildered awe: she's standing, those Rockports slightly apart, but grounded.
She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse, and she is wielding it.
She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force of her little personality, in that crone-ish voice, saying things like, "Back it up, buddy! No, it's reserved!"
Ready? Brace yourselves. Here it comes.
"No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick.
Honey, sit up so they can see you."
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
I finally come -- and now, it's the South.
I don't know what part of the country you live in.
I think we all secretly love stories.
We all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear.
We want to curl up and say, "Tell it to me, tell it to me.
Come on, honey, tell it to me."
But in the South, we love a good story.
People have pulled aside, I mean, they've come out of that queue line, they have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks.
Bets are placed.
"I'm with the little lady. Damn!"
And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement.
She is, after all, Cuban.
I'm thinking, "Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break."
Like you've never thought that in your life? Right? Yeah.
I pull in. I put the car in park.
Engine's still running -- mine, not the car.
I jump out next to her going, "Don't you move!"
"I'm not going anywhere."
She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy.
I come out, and there's Esther.
She's hugging the purse.
"Que?" Which means "what," and so much more.
"Ma, have you no shame?
People are watching us all around," right?
Now, some of them you've got to make up, people.
Secret of the trade.
Guess what? Some of these stories I sculpt a little, here and there.
Some, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there.
She says this to me.
After I say -- let me refresh you -- "have you no shame?"
"No. I gave it up with pantyhose -- they're both too binding."
Yeah, you can clap, but then you're about 30 seconds from the end.
I'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder.
Intrepid soul.
I'm thinking, "This is my kid. How dare she?
She jumped out of that car."
That's OK, because my mother yells at me, I yell at her.
It's a beautiful hierarchy, and it works.
I turn around, but it's not a child. It's a young woman, a little taller than I, pale green, amused eyes.
With her is a young man -- husband, brother, lover, it's not my job.
And she says, "Pardon me, ma'am" -- that's how we talk down there -- "is that your mother?"
I said, "No, I follow little old women around parking lots to see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!"
The boy, now, he says. "Well, what my sister meant" -- they look at each other, it's a knowing glance -- "God, she's crazy!"
I said, , and the young girl and the young boy say, "No, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing."
I said, "Look, please, let me take care of her, OK, because I know her, and believe me, she's like a small atomic weapon, you know, you just want to handle her really gingerly."
And the girl goes, "I know, but, I mean, I swear to God, she reminds us of our mother."
I almost miss it.
He turns to her on the heel of his shoe.
It's a half-whisper, "God, I miss her."
They turn then, shoulder to shoulder, and walk away, lost in their own reverie.
Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw.
And I turn to Esther, who's rocking on those 'ports, and says, "You know what, honey?"
"What, ma?"
"I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about 14, 15 more years, if you're lucky, but after that, honey, you're going to miss me."

<keywords>children,entertainment,memory,storytelling</keywords>

I'm going to talk about two stories today.
One is how we need to use market-based pricing to affect demand and use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions in the transportation sector.
And the other is that there is an incredible opportunity if we choose the right wireless technologies; how we can generate a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors.
I'm really scared.
We need to reduce C02 emissions in ten to fifteen years by 80 percent in order to avert catastrophic effects.
And I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that.
What are catastrophic effects? A three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in 50 percent species extinction.
It's not a movie. This is real life.
And I'm really worried, because when people talk about cars -- which I know something about -- the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking, "Let's use fuel-efficient cars."
If we started today, 10 years from now, at the end of this window of opportunity, those fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent.
That is not enough.
But now I'll talk about some more pleasant things.
Here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes.
So, Zipcar is a company that I founded seven years ago, but it's an example of something called car sharing.
What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve, by the hour and by the day, instead of using their own car.
How does it feel to be a person using a Zipcar?
It means that I pay only for what I need.
All those hours when a car is sitting idle, I'm not paying for it.
It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip.
So, here's a woman that reserved MiniMia, and she had her day.
I can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients.
I can drive my Toyota Element when I'm going to go on that surfing trip.
And the other remarkable thing is it's, I think, the highest status of car ownership.
Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world that I can have at my beck and call, but heaven forbid I would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it.
It's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you couldn't have.
I get all the good stuff and none of the bad.
So, what is the social result of this?
The social result is that today's Zipcar has 100,000 members driving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces.
Instead of driving 12,000 miles a year, which is what the average city dweller does, they drive 500 miles a year. Are they happy?
The company has been doubling in size ever since I founded it, or greater.
People adore the company. And it's better, you know? They like it.
So, how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles?
It's because they said, "It's eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day.
If I'm going to go buy some ice cream, do I really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream? Or maybe I'll do without.
Maybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand."
So, people really respond very quickly to it, to prices.
And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology.
It required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds to reserve a car, go get it, drive it.
And for me, as a service provider, I would never be able to provide you a car for an hour if the transaction cost was anything.
So, without these wireless technologies, this, as a concept, could never happen.
So, here's another example. This company is GoLoco -- I'm launching it in about three weeks -- and I hope to do for ridesharing what I did for car sharing.
This will apply to people across all of America.
Today, 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles, yet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool.
And I think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems to completely change how people feel about ridesharing and make that trip much more efficient.
And so when I think about the future, people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone is this incredibly great social event out of their day.
You know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TEDsters.
How fabulous. Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car?
How did you go food shopping? You went with your neighbor, what a great social time.
You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel, and it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility.
Where can I go today and who can I do it with?
Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel.
And the social benefits: the rate of single-occupancy vehicles is, I told you, 75 percent; I think we can get that down to 50 percent.
The demand for parking, of course, is down, congestion and the CO2 emissions.
One last piece about this, of course, is that it's enabled by wireless technologies.
And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this.
The average American spends 19 percent of their income on their car, and there's a pressure for them to reduce that cost, yet they have no outlet today.
So, the last example of this is congestion pricing, very famously done in London.
It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads.
In London, the day they turned the congestion pricing on, there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight, and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing.
And again, do people like the outcome?
Ken Livingstone was reelected.
So again, we can see that price plays an enormous role in people's willingness to reduce their driving behavior.
We've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982.
There's a huge slack in that system; with the right pricing we can undo that.
Congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world and is, again, wirelessly enabled.
You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London and open and shut those gates.
And what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trial for something called road pricing.
And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go, because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes.
And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient, that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes, so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive.
Whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies will be happening with road pricing.
Why do we travel too much?
Car travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed.
We need to put this better market feedback.
And if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive, what mode of travel, where to live and work.
And wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible.
So, I want to move now to the second part of my story, which is: when are we going to start doing this congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming.
When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait 10 to 15 years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years?
Because I'm going to say, that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight.
And what kind of wireless technology are we going to use?
This is my big vision.
There is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide, respond to emergencies, get traffic moving, provide a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce CO2 emissions in every sector.
And this is a moment from "The Graduate." Do you remember this moment?
You guys are going to be the handsome young guy and I'm going to be the wise businessman.
"I want to say one word to you, just one word."
"Yes, sir?" "Are you listening?" "Yes I am."
"Ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks."
These are also called mesh networks.
And in a mesh, every device contributes to and expands the network, and I think you might have heard a little bit about it before.
I'm going to give you some examples.
You'll be hearing later today from Alan Kay.
These laptops, when a child opens them up, they communicate with every single child in the classroom, within that school, within that village.
And what is the cost of that communication system?
Zero dollars a month.
Here's another example: in New Orleans, video cameras were mesh-enabled so that they could monitor crime in the downtown French Quarter.
When the hurricane happened, the only communication system standing was the mesh network.
Volunteers flew in, added a whole bunch of devices, and for the next 12 months, mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans.
Another example is in Portsmouth, U.K.
They mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals.
You can look at the terminal and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street and when it's coming, and you can buy your tickets in real time.
Again, all mesh-enabled. Monthly communication cost: zero.
So, the beauty of mesh networks: you can have these very low-cost devices.
Zero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable; you can just keep adding them, and as in Katrina, you can keep subtracting them -- as long as there's some, we can still communicate.
They're resilient; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design.
What are the incredible weaknesses?
There isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen -- or in those municipalities, to build out their cities with these wireless networks -- because there's zero ongoing communications cost.
So, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks, and networks are interesting only as they are big.
How do we create a big network?
Are you guys ready again -- "The Graduate"?
This time you will still play the handsome young thing, but I'll be the sexy woman.
"Where did you do it?" "In his car."
So you know, when you stick this idea ...
where would we expect me, Robin Chase, to be thinking is imagine if we put a mesh-network device in every single car across America.
We could have a coast-to-coast, free wireless communication system.
I guess I just want you to think about that.
And why is this going to happen? Because we're going to do congestion pricing, we are going to do road tolls, gas taxes are going to become road pricing.
These things are going to happen.
What's the wireless technology we're going to use?
Maybe we should use a good one. When are we going to do it?
Maybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen.
We should pull it forward.
So, I'd like us to launch the wireless Internet interstate wireless mesh system, and require that this network be accessible to everyone, with open standards.
Right now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices -- I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane -- that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks.
What is the point?
We're transferring just a few little data bits when we're doing road controlling, road pricing.
We have this incredible excess capacity.
So, we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast, we can have resilient nationwide communication systems, we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors.
Imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero.
What you can do with that tool: we can create an economic engine.
Information should be free, and access to information should be free, and we should be charging people for carbon.
I think this is a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act, and I think this is as important and world changing to our economy as electrification.
And if I had my druthers, we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards.
And this open-source version means that it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it -- it could be used around the world very quickly.
So, going back to one of my earlier thoughts.
Imagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network.
When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize -- his fabulous networks -- imagine if there was an open-source mesh communications device that can be put into those networks, to make all that happen.
And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that this little slice of things is going to be for free.
We could make billions of dollars on top of it, but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source.
So, let's take control of this nightmare: implement a gas tax immediately; transition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh; require that the mesh be open to all, with open standards; and, of course, use mesh networks.
Thank you.

So, a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist: I had a baby.
And that's not to say I ever went on to become a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist.
Sorry, TED.
But I did go on to be a reasonably astute, arguably world-class worrier.
One of my girlfriends in graduate school, Marie, said, "Kim, I figured it out.
It's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else; it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are."
So in the spirit of full disclosure, I brought some pictures to share.
Awwww.
I'll just say, July.
Zzzzzzip for safety.
Water wings -- an inch of water.
And then, finally, all suited up for the 90-minute drive to Copper Mountain.
So you can get kind of a feel for this.
So my baby, Vander, is eight years old now.
And, despite being cursed with my athletic inability, he plays soccer.
He's interested in playing football.
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle.
So why would I worry?
Because this is what I do. This is what I teach.
It's what I study. It's what I treat.
And I know that kids get concussed every year.
In fact, more than four million people sustain a concussion every year, and these data are just among kids under 14 who were seen in emergency rooms.
And so when kids sustain a concussion, we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung, but what is it that we're really talking about?
Let's take a look.
All right. "Starsky and Hutch," arguably, yes.
So a car accident.
Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier -- 35 Gs.
A heavy weight boxer punches you straight in the face -- 58 Gs.
In case you missed it, we'll look again.
So look to the right-hand side of the screen.
What would you say?
How many Gs?
Close.
Seventy-two.
Would it be crazy to know, 103 Gs.
The average concussive impact is 95 Gs.
Now, when the kid on the right doesn't get up, we know they've had a concussion.
But how about the kid on the left, or the athlete that leaves the field of play?
How do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion?
How do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play, cleared for return to play, applies to them?
The definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness.
It requires only a change in consciousness, and that can be any one of a number of symptoms, including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy, hearing a ringing in your ear, being more impulsive or hostile than usual.
So given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am, how do I get any sleep at all?
Because I know our brains are resilient.
They're designed to recover from an injury.
If, God forbid, any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion, most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks.
But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury.
In fact, high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college-age peers, and it takes them longer to return to a symptom-free baseline.
After that first injury, their risk for second injury is exponentially greater.
From there, their risk for a third injury, greater still, and so on.
And here's the really alarming part: we don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries.
You guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the NFL.
In a nutshell, this research suggests that among retired NFL players with three or more career concussions, the incidents of early-onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population.
So you've all seen that -- New York Times, you've seen it.
What you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said, "Isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband is forever losing his keys?
Isn't it weird that my 47-year-old husband is forever losing the car?
Isn't it weird that my 48-year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car, from the driveway?"
So I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child.
So it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around some day.
So how do we guarantee the safety of our kids?
How can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids?
Let me tell you what I've come up with.
If only.
My little boy's right there, and he's like, "She's not kidding.
She's totally not kidding."
So in all seriousness, should my kid play football?
Should your kid play football? I don't know.
But I do know there are three things you can do.
The first: study up.
You have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today.
There are some great resources out there.
The CDC has a program, Heads Up.
It's at CDC.gov.
Heads Up is specific to concussion in kids.
The second is a resource I'm personally really proud of.
We've just rolled this out in the last couple months -- CO Kids With Brain Injury.
This is a great resource for student athletes, teachers, parents, professionals, athletic and coaching staff.
It's a great place to start if you have questions.
The second thing is: speak up.
Just two weeks ago, a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas that would have required athletes, kids under 18, to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike died in committee.
It died in large part because it lacked constituent buy-in; it lacked stakeholder traction.
Now I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support, but I am going to tell you that, if it matters to you, your legislators need to know that.
Speak up also with coaching staff.
Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available.
What's the budget for protective equipment?
How old it is?
Maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear -- which brings us to suit up.
Wear a helmet.
The only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening.
Recently, one of my graduate students, Tom said, "Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmet on my way to class."
And Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the G-force of impact by half.
Now I thought that it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade, right, this epiphany of Tom's.
As it turns out, it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet is a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education.
So, should Vander play football?
I can't say no, but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid's wearing a helmet -- like to the car, or at school.
So whether athlete, scholar, over-protected kid, neurotic mom, or otherwise, here's my baby, Vander, reminding you to mind your matter.
Thank you.

So I just want to tell you my story.
I spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace.
And naturally, I encounter a lot of resistance, because it's considered to be anti-intellectual and counter to serious learning.
But I have a problem with that belief, because I know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems.
So I was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is.
So I discovered some very interesting things.
For example, there's no such thing as a flattering definition of a doodle.
In the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool -- as in Yankee Doodle.
In the 18th century, it became a verb, and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone.
In the 19th century, it was a corrupt politician.
And today, we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition, at least to me, which is the following: To doodle officially means to dawdle, to dilly dally, to monkey around, to make meaningless marks, to do something of little value, substance or import, and -- my personal favorite -- to do nothing.
No wonder people are averse to doodling at work.
Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work; it's totally inappropriate.
Additionally, I've heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them, of course, for doodling in classrooms.
And they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom.
There is a powerful cultural norm against doodling in settings in which we are supposed to learn something.
And unfortunately, the press tends to reinforce this norm when they're reporting on a doodling scene -- of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like -- they typically use words like "discovered" or "caught" or "found out," as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed.
And additionally, there is a psychological aversion to doodling -- thank you, Freud.
In the 1930s, Freud told us all that you could analyze people's psyches based on their doodles.
This is not accurate, but it did happen to Tony Blair at the Davos Forum in 2005, when his doodles were, of course, "discovered" and he was labeled the following things.
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle.
And Bill, if you're here, nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal.
But that does contribute to people not wanting to share their doodles.
And here is the real deal. Here's what I believe.
I think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling.
And I'm not comfortable with that.
And so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst, I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth.
And here's the truth: doodling is an incredibly powerful tool, and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn.
So here's a new definition for doodling.
And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary, because I want to talk to you later.
Here's the real definition: Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think.
That is why millions of people doodle.
Here's another interesting truth about the doodle: People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non-doodling counterparts.
We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus, but in reality, it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus.
Additionally, it has a profound effect on creative problem-solving and deep information processing.
There are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions.
They are visual, auditory, reading and writing and kinesthetic.
Now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it, we have to engage at least two of those modalities, or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience.
The incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience.
That is a pretty solid contribution for a behavior equated with doing nothing.
This is so nerdy, but this made me cry when I discovered this.
So they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children, and they found that, across space and time, all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic as they grow.
In other words, they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a predictable order.
And I think that is incredible.
I think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct.
And finally, a lot a people aren't privy to this, but the doodle is a precursor to some of our greatest cultural assets.
This is but one: this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi.
So here is my point: Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room.
On the contrary, doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high.
And I will go you one further.
Because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form, it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy.
My friends, the doodle has never been the nemesis of intellectual thought.
In reality, it is one of its greatest allies.
Thank you.

<title>Sunni Brown: Doodlers, unite!</title>
<description>Studies show that sketching and doodling improve our comprehension -- and our creative thinking. So why do we still feel embarrassed when we're caught doodling in a meeting? Sunni Brown says: Doodlers, unite! She makes the case for unlocking your brain via pad and pen.</description>

Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day?
Do you know how many choices you make in typical week?
I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans, and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about 70 in a typical day.
There was also recently a study done with CEOs in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these CEOs engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks.
And they found that the average CEO engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.
Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less.
Only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time.
Think about your own choices.
Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category?
How well do you think you're doing at managing those choices?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have, which is the choice overload problem.
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions.
Now as I talk about this problem, I'm going to have some questions for you and I'm going to want to know your answers.
So when I ask you a question, since I'm blind, only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.
Otherwise, when I ask you a question, and if your answer is yes, I'd like you to clap your hands.
So for my first question for you today: Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?
Thank you.
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University, I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store; at least at that time it was truly upscale.
It was a store called Draeger's.
Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.
They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.
I used to love going to this store, but on one occasion I asked myself, well how come you never buy anything?
Here's their olive oil aisle.
They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil, including those that were in a locked case that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager, and I asked the manager, "Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?"
And he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday, with cameras ready usually.
We decided to do a little experiment, and we picked jam for our experiment.
Here's their jam aisle.
They had 348 different kinds of jam.
We set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store.
We there put out six different flavors of jam or 24 different flavors of jam, and we looked at two things: First, in which case were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?
More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent, than when there were six, about 40 percent.
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam.
Now we see the opposite effect.
Of the people who stopped when there were 24, only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.
Of the people who stopped when there were six, well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.
Now if you do the math, people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24.
Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it's good for our waistlines -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions.
We choose not to choose, even when it goes against our best self-interests.
So now for the topic of today: financial savings.
Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 650 plans all in the U.S.
And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan, the 401 plan, does that affect people's likelihood to save more for tomorrow.
And what we found was that indeed there was a correlation.
So in these plans, we had about 657 plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.
And what we found was that, the more funds offered, indeed, there was less participation rate.
So if you look at the extremes, those plans that offered you two funds, participation rates were around in the mid-70s -- still not as high as we want it to be.
In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds, participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile.
Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present, even then, it has negative consequences.
So for those people who did choose to participate, the more choices available, the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.
The more choices available, the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts.
Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well-being.
Well, over the past decade, we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices.
They're more likely to delay choosing -- procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.
They're more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices, medical choices.
They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied, even when they do objectively better.
The main reason for this is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams, but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display.
So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses.
The first: Cut.
You've heard it said before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, "Cut."
They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.
But in fact, what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut, get rid of those extraneous redundant options, well there's an increase in sales, there's a lowering of costs, there is an improvement of the choosing experience.
When Proctor &amp; Gamble went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders to 15, they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.
When the Golden Cat Corporation got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products, they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs.
You know, the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products.
The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest retailer, the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is Aldi, and it offers you only 1,400 products -- one kind of canned tomato sauce.
Now in the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing, which was the program that they have at Harvard.
Every single Harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund.
For those people who actually want to choose, they're given 20 funds, not 300 or more funds.
You know, often, people say, "I don't know how to cut.
They're all important choices."
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees, "Tell me how these choices are different from one another.
And if your employees can't tell them apart, neither can your consumers."
Now before we started our session this afternoon, I had a chat with Gary.
And Gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all-expenses-paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here's a description of the road.
And I'd like you to read it.
And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.
Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.
Is that all?
All right, let me show you some more about this.
You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.
Now who's ready to go on this trip.
I think I might have actually heard more hands.
All right.
Now in fact, you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around, but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around.
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you.
Which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem, which is concretization.
That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices, they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice, and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an ATM card or a credit card as opposed to cash?
Because it doesn't feel like real money.
And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more.
So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi and Alessandro Previtero, we did a study with people at ING -- employees that are all working at ING -- and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrollment for their 401 plan.
And during that session, we kept the session exactly the way it used to be, but we added one little thing.
The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more.
By doing that simple thing, there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent.
The third technique: Categorization.
We can handle more categories than we can handle choices.
So for example, here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.
It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor, the magazine aisles range anywhere from 331 different kinds of magazines all the way up to 664.
But you know what?
If I show you 600 magazines and I divide them up into 10 categories, versus I show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories, you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600.
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart.
Here are two different jewelry displays.
One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing."
If you think the display on the left is Swing and the display on the right is Jazz, clap your hands.
Okay, there's some.
If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing, clap your hands.
Okay, a bit more.
Now it turns out you're right.
The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing, but you know what?
This is a highly useless categorization scheme.
The categories need to say something to the chooser, not the choice-maker.
And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.
Who are they actually supposed to be informing?
My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.
It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can, we've just got to take it a little easier.
We have to gradually increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.
Let's take a very, very complicated decision: buying a car.
Here's a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.
You've got to make 60 different decisions, completely make up your car.
Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision.
Car colors, exterior car colors -- I've got 56 choices.
Engines, gearshift -- four choices.
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.
So half of the customers are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors, to low choice, four gearshifts.
The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts, to 56 car colors, high choice.
What am I going to look at?
How engaged you are.
If you keep hitting the default button per decision, that means you're getting overwhelmed, that means I'm losing you.
What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice, they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.
We're losing them.
They go from low choice to high choice, they're hanging in there.
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.
The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented.
If I start you off easy, I learn how to choose.
Even though choosing gearshift doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor, it still prepares me for how to choose.
It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together, so I'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged.
So let me recap.
I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives; concretize -- make it real; categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices; condition for complexity.
All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you, you can use them on yourself, better for the people that you are serving.
Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing.
And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing.
Thank you very much.

I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase.
But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confession, and that is, I'm outfit-obsessed.
I love finding, wearing, and more recently, photographing and blogging a different, colorful, crazy outfit for every single occasion.
But I don't buy anything new.
I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores.
Aww, thank you.
Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet.
I get to meet all kinds of great people; my dollars usually go to a good cause; I look pretty unique; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it going to be my size?
Will I like the color?
Will it be under $20?
If all the answers are yes, I feel as though I've won.
I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED.
I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
I brought seven pairs of underpants and that's it.
Exactly one week's worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase.
I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs.
And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear -- that means I found a few things.
And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.
Does that sound good?
So as I do this, I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that, believe it or not, I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new.
So let's start with Sunday.
I call this "Shiny Tiger."
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.
This whole outfit, including the jacket, cost me $55, and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week.
Monday: Color is powerful.
It is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants.
If you are happy, you are going to attract other happy people to you.
Tuesday: Fitting in is way overrated.
I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in.
Just be who you are.
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people, they will not only get it, they will appreciate it.
Wednesday: Embrace your inner child.
Sometimes people tell me that I look like I'm playing dress-up, or that I remind them of their seven-year-old.
I like to smile and say, "Thank you."
Thursday: Confidence is key.
If you think you look good in something, you almost certainly do.
And if you don't think you look good in something, you're also probably right.
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.
But it wasn't until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant.
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.
If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out, there is no look that you can't pull off.
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock.
Thank you.
Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you: Gold sequins go with everything.
And finally, Saturday: Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
It's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm wearing, and we've had great conversations.
So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase.
So before I go home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything back.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go.
I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner, there is always going to be another crazy, colorful, shiny outfit just waiting for me, if I put a little love in my heart and look.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

<title>Jessi Arrington: Wearing nothing new</title>
<description>Designer Jessi Arrington packed nothing for but 7 pairs of undies, buying the rest of her clothes in thrift stores around LA. It's a meditation on conscious consumption -- wrapped in a rainbow of color and creativity.</description>
<keywords>consumerism,creativity,culture,design</keywords>

I'm standing in front of you today in all humility, wanting to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service and education.
And I'm not a trained academic.
Neither am I a veteran social worker.
I was 26 years in the corporate world, trying to make organizations profitable.
And then in 2003 I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation from my kitchen table.
The first thing that we did was walk through the slums.
You know, by the way, there are two million people in Bangalore, who live in 800 slums.
We couldn't go to all the slums, but we tried to cover as much as we could.
We walked through these slums, identified houses where children would never go to school.
We talked to the parents, tried to convince them about sending their children to school.
We played with the children, and came back home really tired, exhausted, but with images of bright faces, twinkling eyes, and went to sleep.
We were all excited to start, but the numbers hit us then: 200 million children between four to 14 that should be going to school, but do not; 100 million children who go to school but cannot read; 125 million who cannot do basic maths.
We also heard that 250 billion Indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling.
Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary and administrators' salary.
And yet, India has nearly the highest teacher absenteeism in the world, with one out of four teachers not going to school at all the entire academic year.
Those numbers were absolutely mind-boggling, overwhelming, and we were constantly asked, "When will you start? How many schools will you start?
How many children will you get?
How are you going to scale?
How are you going to replicate?"
It was very difficult not to get scared, not to get daunted.
But we dug our heels and said, "We're not in the number game.
We want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school, sent to college, and get them prepared for better living, a high value job."
So, we started Parikrma.
The first Parikrma school started in a slum where there were 70,000 people living below the poverty line.
Our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums, a second story building, the only second story building inside the slums.
And that rooftop did not have any ceiling, only half a tin sheet.
That was our first school. One hundred sixty-five children.
Indian academic year begins in June.
So, June it rains, so many a times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof, waiting for the rain to stop.
My God! What a bonding exercise that was.
And all of us that were under that roof are still here together today.
Then came the second school, the third school, the fourth school and a junior college.
In six years now, we have four schools, one junior college, 1,100 children coming from 28 slums and four orphanages.
Our dream is very simple: to send each of these kids, get them prepared to be educated but also to live peacefully, contented in this conflict-ridden chaotic globalized world.
Now, when you talk global you have to talk English.
And so all our schools are English medium schools.
But they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak English well.
No one in their family has spoken English.
No one in their generation has spoken English.
But how wrong it is.
Girl: I like adventurous books, and some of my favorites are Alfred Hitchcock and [unclear] and Hardy Boys.
Although they are like in different contexts, one is magical, the other two are like investigation, I like those books because they have something special in them.
The vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing.
I mean like once I pick up one book I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book.
Even if it takes me four and a half hours, or three and half hours to finish my book, I do it.
Boy: I did good research and I got the information [on the] world's fastest cars.
I like Ducati ZZ143, because it is the fastest, the world's fastest bike, and I like Pulsar 220 DTSI because it is India's fastest bike.
Shukla Bose: Well, that girl that you saw, her father sells flowers on the roadside.
And this little boy has been coming to school for five years.
But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world love fast bikes?
He hasn't seen one, he hasn't ridden one, of course, but he has done a lot of research through Google search.
You know, when we started with our English medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible, the ICSE curriculum.
And again, there were people who laughed at me and said, "Don't be crazy choosing such a tough curriculum for these students.
They'll never be able to cope."
Not only do our children cope very well, but they excel in it.
You should just come across to see how well our children do.
There is also this myth that parents from the slums are not interested in their children going to school; they'd much rather put them to work.
That's absolute hogwash.
All parents all over the world want their children to lead a better life than themselves, but they need to believe that change is possible.
SB: We have 80 percent attendance for all our parents-teachers meeting.
Sometimes it's even 100 percent, much more than many privileged schools.
Fathers have started to attend.
It's very interesting. When we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register.
Now they have started writing their signature.
The children have taught them.
It's amazing how much children can teach.
We have, a few months ago, actually late last year, we had a few mothers who came to us and said, "You know, we want to learn how to read and write.
Can you teach us?" So, we started an afterschool for our parents, for our mothers.
We had 25 mothers who came regularly after school to study.
We want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools.
Ninety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics.
So, you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from.
We have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs and when they come back, most times sober, we have to find a job for them so that they don't regress.
We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook.
We have taught them nutrition, hygiene.
We have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children.
They do a very good job because their children are eating their food, but most importantly this is the first time they have got respect, and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile.
More than 90 percent of our non-teaching staff are all parents and extended families.
We've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school.
Vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school.
There is also this myth that children from the slums cannot integrate with mainstream.
Take a look at this little girl who was one of the 28 children from all privileged schools, best schools in the country that was selected for the Duke University talent identification program and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad.
Girl: Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA, it was such a pride for us to go to that camp.
Everybody was very friendly, especially I got a lot of friends.
And I felt that my English has improved a lot going there and chatting with friends.
There they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset, a totally different society.
I mingled with almost everyone.
They were very friendly.
I had very good friends there, who are from Delhi, who are from Mumbai.
Even now we are in touch through Facebook.
After this Ahmedabad trip I've been like a totally different mingling with people and all of those.
Before that I feel like I wasn't like this.
I don't even mingle, or start speaking with someone so quickly.
My accent with English improved a lot.
And I learned football, volleyball, Frisbee, lots of games.
And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here.
Such beautiful food, I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful.
I enjoyed eating food like [unclear] would come and ask me, "Yes ma'am, what you want?" It was so good to hear!
SB: This girl was working as a maid before she came to school.
And today she wants to be a neurologist.
Our children are doing brilliantly in sports.
They are really excelling.
There is an inter-school athletic competition that is held every year in Bangalore, where 5,000 children participate from 140 best schools in the city.
We've got the best school award for three years successively.
And our children are coming back home with bags full of medals, with lots of admirers and friends.
Last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school.
We also have our very own dream team.
Why is this happening? Why this confidence?
Is it the exposure? We have professors from MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Indian Institute of Science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas, experiments, much beyond the classroom.
Art, music are considered therapy and mediums of expression.
We also believe that it's the content that is more important.
It is not the infrastructure, not the toilets, not the libraries, but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important.
Creating an environment of learning, of inquiry, of exploration is what is true education.
When we started Parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking.
We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan.
But we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time, not get bogged with numbers, and actually see the child complete the circle of life, and unleash his total potential.
We do not believe in scale because we believe in quality, and scale and numbers will automatically happen.
We have corporates that have stood behind us, and we are able to, now, open more schools.
But we began with the idea of one child at a time.
This is five-year-old Parusharam.
He was begging by a bus stop a few years ago, got picked up and is now in an orphanage, has been coming to school for the last four and a half months.
He's in kindergarten.
He has learned how to speak English.
We have a model by which kids can speak English and understand English in three month's time.
He can tell you stories in English of the thirsty crow, of the crocodile and of the giraffe.
And if you ask him what he likes to do he will say, "I like sleeping.
I like eating. I like playing."
And if you ask him what he wants to do, he will say, "I want to horsing."
Now, "horsing" is going for a horse ride.
So, Parusharam comes to my office every day.
He comes for a tummy rub, because he believes that will give me luck.
When I started Parikrma I began with a great deal of arrogance of transforming the world.
But today I have been transformed.
I have been changed with my children.
I've learned so much from them: love, compassion, imagination and such creativity.
Parusharam is Parikrma with a simple beginning but a long way to go.
I promise you, Parusharam will speak in the TED conference a few years from now.
Thank you.

Thank you very much.
Now, I've got a story for you.
When I arrived off the plane, after a very long journey from the West of England, my computer, my beloved laptop, had gone mad, and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! -- and the display on it -- anyway, the whole thing had burst.
And I went to the IT guys here and a gentleman mended my computer, and then he said, "What are you doing here?"
and I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing," and he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well."
And I said, "Do you really?"
Anyway, so you're in for a treat, because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark.
I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby.
This song is called "Farther than the Sun."
Strung in the wind I called you but you did not hear ... And you're a plant that needs poor soil and I have treated you too well to give up flowers ... Oh, I have been too rich for you ... Farther than the sun from me Farther than I'd have you be And I go north, I get so cold My heart is lava under stone You are not worthy You are not worthy ... With your calculating eyes spinning figures you cannot see me You cannot see me ... And if I tell myself enough I'll believe it You are not worthy The sea, it freezes over ... to trap the light And I'm in love with being in love and you were never quite the one In Gerda's eyes Fragments of what you've become And all the moths that fly at night believe electric light is bright You are not worthy You are not worthy With your calculating eyes Spinning figures You cannot see me, no And if I tell myself enough I'll believe it You are not worthy Farther than the sun from me Farther than I'd have you be And I go north, I get so cold My heart is lava under stone You are not worthy You are not worthy With your calculating eyes Spinning figures You cannot see me, no ... And if I tell myself enough, I'll believe it Thank you very much.

My work is play.
And I play when I design.
I even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure that I actually do that, and the definition of play, number one, was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor, and number two was gambling.
And I realize I do both when I'm designing.
I'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time.
And I think that if you're not, there's probably something inherently wrong if you're a designer.
But the serious part is what threw me, and I couldn't quite get a handle on it until I remembered an essay.
And it's an essay I read 30 years ago.
It was written by Russell Baker, who used to write an "Observer" column in the New York Times.
He's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read you this essay, or an excerpt from it because it really hit home for me.
Here is a letter of friendly advice.
Be serious, it says.
What it means, of course, is, be solemn.
Being solemn is easy.
Being serious is hard.
Children almost always begin by being serious, which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class.
Adults, on the whole, are solemn.
In politics, the rare candidate who is serious, like Adlai Stevenson, is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn, like Eisenhower.
That's because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness, which is rare, but more comfortable to endorse solemnity, which is commonplace.
Jogging, which is commonplace, and widely accepted as good for you, is solemn.
Poker is serious.
Washington, D.C. is solemn.
New York is serious.
Going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the future is solemn.
Taking a long walk by yourself, during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's, is serious.
Now, when I apply Russell Baker's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design, it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality.
Solemn design is often important and very effective design.
Solemn design is also socially correct, and is accepted by appropriate audiences.
It's what right-thinking designers and all the clients are striving for.
Serious design, serious play, is something else.
For one thing, it often happens spontaneously, intuitively, accidentally or incidentally.
It can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance, or out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness.
But mostly, it's achieved through all those kind of crazy parts of human behavior that don't really make any sense.
Serious design is imperfect.
It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind.
Serious design is also -- often -- quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view.
That's because the art of serious play is about invention, change, rebellion -- not perfection.
Perfection happens during solemn play.
Now, I always saw design careers like surreal staircases.
If you look at the staircase, you'll see that in your 20s the risers are very high and the steps are very short, and you make huge discoveries.
You sort of leap up very quickly in your youth.
That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn, and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you're just jumping right up there.
As you get older, the risers get shallower and the steps get wider, and you start moving along at a slower pace because you're making fewer discoveries.
And as you get older and more decrepit, you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing, long staircase, leading you into oblivion.
I find it's actually getting really hard to be serious.
I'm hired to be solemn, but I find more and more that I'm solemn when I don't have to be.
And in my 35 years of working experience, I think I was really serious four times.
And I'm going to show them to you now, because they came out of very specific conditions.
It's great to be a kid.
Now, when I was in my early 20s, I worked in the record business, designing record covers for CBS Records, and I had no idea what a great job I had.
I thought everybody had a job like that.
And what -- the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was, what was going on around me and the things that came at the time I walked into design were the enemy.
I really, really, really hated the typeface Helvetica.
I thought the typeface Helvetica was the cleanest, most boring, most fascistic, really repressive typeface, and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica.
And when I was in my college days, this was the sort of design that was fashionable and popular.
This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak, but I just hated it, because it was designed with Helvetica, and I made parodies about it.
I just thought it was, you know, completely boring.
So -- so, my goal in life was to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica.
And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find it.
And there weren't a lot of books about the history of design in the early 70s. There weren't -- there wasn't a plethora of design publishing.
You actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe.
You had to go places and find the stuff.
And what I responded to was, you know, Art Nouveau, or deco, or Victorian typography, or things that were just completely not Helvetica.
And I taught myself design this way, and this was sort of my early years, and I used these things in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design.
I wasn't educated. I just sort of put these things together.
I mixed up Victorian designs with pop, and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else.
And I made these very lush, very elaborate record covers, not because I was being a post-modernist or a historicist -- because I didn't know what those things were.
I just hated Helvetica.
And that kind of passion drove me into very serious play, a kind of play I could never do now because I'm too well-educated.
And there's something wonderful about that form of youth, where you can let yourself grow and play, and be really a brat, and then accomplish things.
By the end of the '70s, actually, the stuff became known.
I mean, these covers appeared all over the world, and they started winning awards, and people knew them.
And I was suddenly a post-modernist, and I began a career as -- in my own business.
And first I was praised for it, then criticized for it, but the fact of the matter was, I had become solemn.
I didn't do what I think was a piece of serious work again for about 14 years.
I spent most of the '80s being quite solemn, turning out these sorts of designs that I was expected to do because that's who I was, and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead, and getting rediscovered all over again.
So, here was the second condition for which I think I accomplished some serious play.
There's a Paul Newman movie that I love called "The Verdict."
I don't know how many of you have seen it, but it's a beaut.
And in the movie, he plays a down-and-out lawyer who's become an ambulance chaser.
And he's taken on -- he's given, actually -- a malpractice suit to handle that's sort of an easy deal, and in the midst of trying to connect the deal, he starts to empathize and identify with his client, and he regains his morality and purpose, and he goes on to win the case.
And in the depth of despair, in the midst of the movie, when it looks like he can't pull this thing off, and he needs this case, he needs to win this case so badly.
There's a shot of Paul Newman alone, in his office, saying, "This is the case. There are no other cases.
This is the case. There are no other cases."
And in that moment of desire and focus, he can win.
And that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play.
And I had that moment in 1994 when I met a theater director named George Wolfe, who was going to have me design an identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival, then known, and then became the Public Theater.
And I began getting immersed in this project in a way I never was before.
This is what theater advertising looked like at that time.
This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times.
So, this is sort of a comment on the time.
And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this.
They had no logo and no identity, but they had these very iconic posters painted by Paul Davis.
And George Wolf had taken over from another director and he wanted to change the theater, and he wanted to make it urban and loud and a place that was inclusive.
So, drawing on my love of typography, I immersed myself into this project.
And what was different about it was the totality of it, was that I really became the voice, the visual voice, of a place in a way I had never done before, where every aspect -- the smallest ad, the ticket, whatever it was -- was designed by me.
There was no format.
There was no in-house department that these things were pushed to.
I literally for three years made everything -- every scrap of paper, everything online, that this theater did.
And it was the only job, even though I was doing other jobs.
I lived and breathed it in a way I haven't with a client since.
It enabled me to really express myself and grow.
And I think that you know when you're going to be given this position, and it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity, it's the moment of serious play.
I did these things, and I still do them.
I still work for the Public Theater.
I'm on their board, and I still am involved with it.
The high point of the Public Theater, I think, was in 1996, two years after I designed it, which was the "Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk" campaign that was all over New York.
But something happened to it, and what happened to it was, it became very popular.
And that is a kiss of death for something serious because it makes it solemn.
And what happened was that New York City, to a degree, ate my identity because people began to copy it.
Here's an ad in the New York Times somebody did for a play called "Mind Games."
Then "Chicago" came out, used similar graphics, and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away, which meant I had to change it.
So, I changed it so that every season was different, and I continued to do these posters, but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual, and they didn't have that heft of everything being the same thing.
Now -- and I think since the Public Theater, I must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions, and I don't think I ever -- I ever grasped that seriousness again -- I do them for very big, important institutions in New York City.
The institutions are solemn, and so is the design.
They're better crafted than the Public Theater was, and they spend more money on them, but I think that that moment comes and goes.
The best way to accomplish serious design -- which I think we all have the opportunity to do -- is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job.
That doesn't happen very often, but it happened to me in the year 2000, when for some reason or another, a whole pile of different architects started to ask me to design the insides of theaters with them, where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings.
I'd never done this kind of work before.
I didn't know how to read an architectural plan, I didn't know what they were talking about, and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job -- a single job -- could go on for four years because I was used to immediacy in graphic design, and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me, with ADD.
So, it was a rough -- it was a rough go, but I fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture because I didn't know what I was doing.
I said, "Why can't the signage be on the floor?"
New Yorkers look at their feet.
And then I found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor, so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense.
They integrated with the building in really peculiar ways.
They ran around corners, they went up sides of buildings, and they melded into the architecture.
This is Symphony Space on 90th Street and Broadway, and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics.
And the architect, Jim Polshek, essentially gave me a canvas to play typography out on.
And it was serious play.
This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, made out of completely inexpensive materials.
Extruded typography that's backlit with neon.
Things I never did before, built before.
I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do.
Donors' walls made out of Lucite.
And then, inexpensive signage.
I think my favorite of these was this little job in Newark, New Jersey.
It's a performing arts school.
This is the building that -- they had no money, and they had to recast it, and they said, if we give you 100,000 dollars, what can you do with it?
And I did a little Photoshop job on it, and I said, Well, I think we can paint it.
And we did. And it was play.
And there's the building. Everything was painted -- typography over the whole damn thing, including the air conditioning ducts.
I hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building, and they loved it.
They got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously.
They used to climb up on the building and call me and tell me that they had to correct my typography -- that my spacing was wrong, and they moved it, and they did wonderful things with it.
They were pretty serious, too. It was quite wonderful.
By the time I did Bloomberg's headquarters my work had begun to become accepted.
People wanted it in big, expensive places.
And that began to make it solemn.
Bloomberg was all about numbers, and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED that my partner, Lisa Strausfeld, programmed.
But it became the end of the seriousness of the play, and it started to, once again, become solemn.
This is a current project in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I got to be goofy.
I was invited to design a logo for this neighborhood, called the North Side, and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo.
I think that's rather creepy, actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo?
A neighborhood has a thing -- it's got a landmark, it's got a place, it's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean, what would that be?
So I had to actually give a presentation to a city council and neighborhood constituents, and I went to Pittsburgh and I said, "You know, really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town.
Why don't you celebrate them, and make the underpasses landmarks?"
So I began doing this crazy presentation of these installations -- potential installations -- on these underpass bridges, and stood up in front of the city council -- and was a little bit scared, I have to admit.
But I was so utterly unqualified for this project, and so utterly ridiculous, and ignored the brief so desperately that I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness, just completely because it was so goofy to begin with.
And this is the bridge they're actually painting up and preparing as we speak.
It will change every six months, and it will become an art installation in the North Side of Pittsburgh, and it will probably become a landmark in the area.
John Hockenberry told you a bit about my travail with Citibank, that is now a 10-year relationship, and I still work with them.
And I actually am amused by them and like them, and think that as a very, very, very, very, very big corporation they actually keep their graphics very nice.
I drew the logo for Citibank on a napkin in the first meeting.
That was the play part of the job.
And then I spent a year going to long, tedious, boring meetings, trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears.
I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year.
We made idiotic presentations showing how the Citi logo made sense, and how it was really derived from an umbrella, and we made animations of these things, and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
And it was worth it, because they bought this thing, and it played out on such a grand scale, and it's so internationally recognizable, but for me it was actually a very, very depressing year.
As a matter of fact, they actually never bought onto the logo until Fallon put it on its very good "Live Richly" campaign, and then everybody accepted it all over the world.
So during this time I needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy, crazy existence of going to these long, idiotic meetings.
And I was up in my country house, and for some reason, I began painting these very big, very involved, laborious, complicated maps of the entire world, and listing every place on the planet, and putting them in, and misspelling them, and putting things in the wrong spot, and completely controlling the information, and going totally and completely nuts with it.
They would take me about six months initially, but then I started getting faster at it.
Here's the United States.
Every single city of the United States is on here.
And it hung for about eight months at the Cooper-Hewitt, and people walked up to it, and they would point to a part of the map and they'd say, "Oh, I've been here."
And, of course, they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot.
But what I liked about it was, I was controlling my own idiotic information, and I was creating my own palette of information, and I was totally and completely at play.
One of my favorites was this painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election that has the election results rolling around in the water.
I keep that for evidence.
Somebody was up at my house and saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery, and I had a first show about two-and-a-half years ago, and I showed these paintings that I'm showing you now.
And then a funny thing happened -- they sold.
And they sold quickly, and became rather popular.
We started making prints from them.
This is Manhattan, one from the series.
This is a print from the United States which we did in red, white and blue.
We began doing these big silkscreen prints, and they started selling, too.
So, the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years, which meant that I really had to paint these paintings much faster than I had ever done them. And I -- they started to become more political, and I picked areas that sort of were in the news or that I had some feeling about, and I began doing these things.
And then this funny thing happened.
I found that I was no longer at play.
I was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show, which is not where I started with these things.
So, while they became successful, I know how to make them, so I'm not a neophyte, and they're no longer serious -- they have become solemn.
And that's a terrifying factor -- when you start something and it turns that way -- because it means that all that's left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can push, that you can invent, that you can be ignorant about, that you can be arrogant about, that you can fail with, and that you can be a fool with.
Because in the end, that's how you grow, and that's all that matters.
So, I'm plugging along here -- and I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase.
Thank you very much.

<title>Paula Scher: Great design is serious, not solemn</title>
<description>Paula Scher looks back at a life in design and pinpoints the moment when she started really having fun. Look for gorgeous designs and images from her legendary career.</description>
<keywords>art,arts,design,entertainment,happiness</keywords>

I'd like to start tonight by something completely different, asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.
90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean, and it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.
And it's a lively and a lovely place, but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our -- not only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing, our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland, but also, most recently, with climate change, and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.
Now, as we continue to tinker with the oceans, more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.
And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.
Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful, and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday, but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up.
About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.
So it may be good for the waistline, but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.
And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans, that is, unless you eat jellyfish.
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola, whose primary prey are jellyfish.
This animal is in "The Guinness World Book of Records" for being the world's heaviest bony fish.
It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.
And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish -- that its favorite food is the moon jelly.
So it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way, even if one is eating the other.
Now this is typically how you see sunfish, this is where they get their common name.
They like to sunbathe, can't blame them.
They just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior, they lie out and bask on the surface.
Their other name, Mola mola, is -- it sounds Hawaiian, but it's actually Latin for millstone, and that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.
It's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.
And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place, was this terribly bizarre shape.
You know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek, and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes -- they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength, and then you look at the sunfish.
And this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just -- it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.
So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story?
Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution.
The Mola's no exception.
They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared, 65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs, and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction -- oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.
Of course evolution is somewhat random, and you know, about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs -- we're going to head to the high seas.
And lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing, and we turn our puffer into the Mola.
You know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.
They look -- maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps, but in fact, in fact they are the -- they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea, right up there with flat fish.
They're -- every single thing about that fish has been changed.
And in terms of fishes -- fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern, just 50 million years ago, so -- so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.
They start as little eggs, and they're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.
A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs, can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine -- and they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.
And from that little egg, they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry, and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage.
They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.
That's a little diver up there in the corner.
They're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.
From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.
600 million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby, and you had to feed this thing.
That would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.
Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but -- we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild, but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium -- one of the first places to have them in captivity -- they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.
I said, now, that's a true American.
So being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas, because schooling used to be salvation for fishes, but it's suicide for fishes now.
But unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school, they still get caught in nets as by-catch.
If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination, then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators -- how they live their lives, like the Mola.
And unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch -- up to 26 percent of the drift net.
And in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries, they make up up to 90 percent.
So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.
And how do you do that?
How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world.
This is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries -- it doesn't go to land.
How do you get insight?
How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?
Well, there's some great new technology that has just recently become available, and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.
And it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.
That little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity, which is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.
And it can record this data for up to two years, and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time, float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue, to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers, and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have -- we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.
So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.
And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.
Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites.
They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.
I think Donne wrote a poem about that.
But they have 40 genera of parasites, and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.
And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.
They don't seem to mind, so far.
So what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific.
We're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.
And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents, using temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.
We'd love to tag in Monterey.
Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.
Not this time of year -- it's more around October.
And we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey -- but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.
The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay, rips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style, and then tosses them back and forth.
And I'm not exaggerating, it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.
And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior, it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.
The poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds, so we head down south, to San Diego.
Not so many California sea lions down there.
And the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily, and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.
And under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there because it's spa time for the Molas there.
As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.
And they come and give the Molas -- you can see they strike this funny little position that says, "I'm not threatening, but I need a massage."
And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head, and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean -- because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.
And it's also a great place to go down south because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.
I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right, will say, "Okay, scratch me right there."
You truly can swim up to a Mola -- they're very gentle -- and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.
So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific; we've gone over to another part of the Pacific, and we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.
And over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.
And they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.
We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.
Well, not the one we tagged!
And everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone, to the fin muscle to -- I think that ís pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten.
So the hardest part of tagging, now, is after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.
And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe, I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording.
The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars, so you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.
And so the waiting is really the hardest part.
I'm going to show you our latest dataset.
And it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.
And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data, we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?
Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?
And we found that they kind of are homebodies.
They're not big migrators. This is their track: we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.
And after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.
And that's kind of their home range.
Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure, that population doesn't get replenished.
So that's a very important piece of data.
But also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish.
They're super industrious.
And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we -- they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up and up and down, up to 40 times a day.
As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.
Down -- and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.
They plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade, and this is why you see them on the surface -- it's so cold down there.
They've got to come up, warm, get that solar power, and then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.
And they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer -- which a whole variety of food's in that layer.
So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker, they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature.
We see the same pattern -- now with these tags we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas, a real three-dimensional play.
This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life, where they're going to be tagging all over the world and the Mola's going to enter into that.
And what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals, and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.
Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.
It's never -- it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.
Which brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun.
I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.
And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered, and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.
But people would write into the site with all sorts of, all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.
And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared -- a shared love and an interest in the oceans.
I was getting reports from Catholic nuns, Jewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians -- everybody writing in, united by their love of life.
And to me that -- I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself: "One touch of nature makes the whole world kin."
And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.
If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.

<title>Tierney Thys: Swim with the giant sunfish</title>
<description>Marine biologist Tierney Thys asks us to step into the water to visit the world of the &lt;i&gt;Mola mola&lt;/i&gt;, or giant ocean sunfish. Basking, eating jellyfish and getting massages, this behemoth offers clues to life in the open sea.</description>

One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.
Under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously.
The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri.
She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.
To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree.
Just then, with a loud bang, the heavens opened.
And the god Indra jumped into the clearing.
Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri.
Ah-hah.
The woman paid him no heed.
So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor, and proceeded to rape her.
Then Indra disappeared.
And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared.
He realized at once what had happened.
So, he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice.
So, the god Vishnu arrived.
"Are there any witnesses?"
"Just a one-eyed monkey," said the Brahmin.
Now, the one-eyed monkey really wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice, so she retold events exactly as they had happened.
Vishnu gave his judgment.
"The god Indra has sinned, in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin.
May he be called to wash away his sins."
So, Indra arrived, and performed the sacrifice of the horse.
And so it transpired that a horse was killed, a god was made sin-free, a Brahmin's ego was appeased, a woman ... was ruined, and a one-eyed monkey was left ...
very confused at what we humans call justice.
In India there is a rape every three minutes.
In India, only 25 percent of rapes come to a police station, and of these 25 percent that come to a police station, convictions are only in four percent of the cases.
That's a lot of women who don't get justice.
And it's not only about women.
Look around you, look at your own countries.
There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.
If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail.
If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis, our tribals, the Naxalites.
If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks.
There is a trend here.
And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story, always get to tell their truth as The Truth.
So, have we all become one-eyed -- two-eyed instead of one-eyed -- monkeys?
Have we stopped seeing injustice?
Good morning.
You know, I have told this story close to 550 times, in audiences in 40 countries, to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth, and every time it hits something.
Now, if I were to go into the same crowd and say, "I want to lecture you about justice and injustice," they would say, "Thank you very much, we have other things to do."
And that is the astonishing power of art.
Art can go through where other things can't.
You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices, breaks through everything that you have as your mask, that says, "I am this, I am that, I am that."
No. It breaks through those.
And it reaches somewhere where other things don't.
And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change, we need a language that reaches through.
Hitler knew it; he used Wagner to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.
And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth.
And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies, and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require, they also know the power of the arts.
For me it came very early.
When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer, came upon a phenomenon that worried her.
It was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural Gujarat, because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families.
And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.
He came to talk to her and said, "What is this about?"
She told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dowry Dance.
Imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women.
Many years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook in "The Mahabharata" playing this feisty feminine feminist called Draupadi, I had similar experiences.
Big fat black mamas in the Bronx used to come and say, "Hey girl, that's it!"
And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say, "Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça? Ça!"
And then aboriginal women in Africa would come and say, "This is it!"
And I thought, "This is what we need, as a language."
We had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health.
Well, millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year.
And that's because there is no clean water to drink, or in countries like India, people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation.
So, what do they do?
They drink the water they know is dirty, they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice and they die.
And governments have not been able to provide clean water.
They try and build it. They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.
And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.
So what do you do? Do you let them die?
Well, somebody had a great idea.
And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field.
Most houses in Asia and India have a cotton garment.
And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this, that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over, can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through.
So, why aren't governments blaring this on television?
Why isn't it on every poster across the third world?
Because there is no profit in it.
Because nobody can get a kickback.
But it still needs to get to people.
And here is one of the ways we get it to people.
[Video] Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.
You know how expensive those are.
I have a solution that requires neither machine, nor wood, nor cooking gas.
What solution?
Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have.
Boy: Grand-dad, tell me the solution please.
I will tell all of you. Just wait.
Here father. Yes, of course.
Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds.
All right, father.
And you, you count that she does it right.
One, two, three, four folds we make.
All the germs from the water we take.
Chorus: One, two, three, four folds we make.
All the germs from the water we take.
Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.
Our drinking water safe we make.
Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.
Our drinking water safe we make.
Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari.
So this is the cotton sari.
And through this we will have clean water.
I think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.
While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution, and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders, we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage, or whether it's domestic violence, whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere.
So, why are we not doing something to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?
What are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we indulge in, that we can stop, and that there are other ways of actually taking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people.
Well, here is one such way.
You are peaceful people.
Your parents were peaceful people.
Your grandparents were peaceful people.
So much peace in one place?
How could it be otherwise?
But, what if ...
Yes. What if ...
One little gene in you has been trying to get through?
From your beginnings in Africa, through each generation, may be passed on to you, in your creation. It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you.
And if it's in you, then it's in me too. Oh, dear.
It's what made you smack your baby brother, stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother.
It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside, when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide.
Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work, and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh, dear.
And as for outsiders, white, black or brown, tar and feather them, and whip them out of town.
It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean.
Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection.
Adrenaline, kill. It'll give you the will.
Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it.
You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.
Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me.
Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln.
Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi.
Goodbye, Martin Luther King.
Hello, gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood.
Hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can't even afford to give them food.
Hello civilization. Hello, 21st century.
Look what we've ...
look what they've done.
Mainstream art, cinema, has been used across the world to talk about social issues.
A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti, which suddenly spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change.
In Venezuela, one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called Crystal.
And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer, 75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done.
And of course, "The Vagina Monologues" we know about.
And there are stand-up comics who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues.
So, why is it, that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world, we need a more just world, why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?
What I need to say to the planners of the world, the governments, the strategists is, "You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake.
It needs to be the yeast."
Because, any future planning, if 2048 is when we want to get there, unless the arts are put with the scientists, with the economists, with all those who prepare for the future, badly, we're not going to get there.
And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen.
So, what is it that we require? What is it that we need?
We need to break down our vision of what planners are, of what the correct way of a path is.
And to say all these years of trying to make a better world, and we have failed.
There are more people being raped. There are more wars.
There are more people dying of simple things.
So, something has got to give. And that is what I want.
Can I have my last audio track please?
Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully.
Her father the king said, "Don't whistle."
Her mother the queen said, "Hai, don't whistle."
But the princess continued whistling.
The years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman, who whistled even more beautifully.
Her father the king said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"
Her mother the queen said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"
But the king had an idea.
He announced a Swayamvara.
He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.
"Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage!"
Soon the palace filled with princes whistling.
Some whistled badly.
Some whistled well.
But nobody could defeat the princess.
"Now what shall we do?" said the king.
"Now what shall we do?" said the queen.
But the princess said, "Father, Mother, don't worry.
I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men and I am going to ask them if they defeated correctly.
And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."
So she went up to each and said, "Do you accept that I have defeated you?"
And they said, "Me? Defeated by a woman?
No way, that's impossible! No no no no no! That's not possible."
Till finally one prince said, "Princess, I accept, you have defeated me."
"Uh-huh ..." she said.
"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."
Thank you.

<title>Mallika Sarabhai: Dance to change the world</title>
<description>At TEDIndia, Mallika Sarabhai, a dancer/actor/politician, tells a transformative story in dance -- and argues that the arts may be the most powerful way to effect change, whether political, social or personal.</description>
<keywords>culture,dance,entertainment,global issues,politics,social change</keywords>

Now this is a very un-TED-like thing to do, but let's kick off the afternoon with a message from a mystery sponsor.
Anonymous: Dear Fox News, it has come to our unfortunate attention that both the name and nature of Anonymous has been ravaged.
We are everyone. We are no one.
We are anonymous. We are legion.
We do not forgive. We do not forget.
We are but the base of chaos.
Misha Glenny: Anonymous, ladies and gentlemen -- a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in 2011.
And they're pretty scary.
You never know when they're going to attack next, who or what the consequences will be.
But interestingly, they have a sense of humor.
These guys hacked into Fox News' Twitter account to announce President Obama's assassination.
Now you can imagine the panic that would have generated in the newsroom at Fox.
"What do we do now?
Put on a black armband, or crack open the champagne?"
And of course, who could escape the irony of a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
being a victim of hacking for a change.
Sometimes you turn on the news and you say, "Is there anyone left to hack?"
Sony Playstation Network -- done, the government of Turkey -- tick, Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency -- a breeze, the CIA -- falling off a log.
In fact, a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world: those that know they've been hacked, and those that don't.
I mean three companies providing cybersecurity services to the FBI have been hacked.
Is nothing sacred anymore, for heaven's sake?
Anyway, this mysterious group Anonymous -- and they would say this themselves -- they are providing a service by demonstrating how useless companies are at protecting our data.
But there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous -- they are ideologically driven.
They claim that they are battling a dastardly conspiracy.
They say that governments are trying to take over the Internet and control it, and that they, Anonymous, are the authentic voice of resistance -- be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships, against global media corporations, or against intelligence agencies, or whoever it is.
And their politics are not entirely unattractive.
Okay, they're a little inchoate.
There's a strong whiff of half-baked anarchism about them.
But one thing is true: we are at the beginning of a mighty struggle for control of the Internet.
The Web links everything, and very soon it will mediate most human activity.
Because the Internet has fashioned a new and complicated environment for an old-age dilemma that pits the demands of security with the desire for freedom.
Now this is a very complicated struggle.
And unfortunately, for mortals like you and me, we probably can't understand it very well.
Nonetheless, in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago, I decided I would try and do that.
And I sort of get it.
These were the various things that I was looking at as I was trying to understand it.
But in order to try and explain the whole thing, I would need another 18 minutes or so to do it, so you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion, and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet one way or the other, but in a configuration that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around.
So there you are.
And as you see, in the middle, there is our old friend, the hacker.
The hacker is absolutely central to many of the political, social and economic issues affecting the Net.
And so I thought to myself, "Well, these are the guys who I want to talk to."
And what do you know, nobody else does talk to the hackers.
They're completely anonymous, as it were.
So despite the fact that we are beginning to pour billions, hundreds of billions of dollars, into cybersecurity -- for the most extraordinary technical solutions -- no one wants to talk to these guys, the hackers, who are doing everything.
Instead, we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions, which cost a huge amount of money.
And so nothing is going into the hackers.
Well, I say nothing, but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit in Turin, Italy called the Hackers Profiling Project.
And they are doing some fantastic research into the characteristics, into the abilities and the socialization of hackers.
But because they're a U.N. operation, maybe that's why governments and corporations are not that interested in them.
Because it's a U.N. operation, of course, it lacks funding.
But I think they're doing very important work.
Because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry, we have a definite lack of -- call me old-fashioned -- human intelligence.
Now, so far I've mentioned the hackers Anonymous who are a politically motivated hacking group.
Of course, the criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals.
But interestingly, Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain.
But what about the real cybercriminals?
Well real organized crime on the Internet goes back about 10 years when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers developed a website, which led to the industrialization of cybercrime.
Welcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet.
This is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the Net.
Now CarderPlanet was very interesting.
Cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details, to exchange information about new malware that was out there.
And remember, this is a time when we're seeing for the first time so-called off-the-shelf malware.
This is ready for use, out-of-the-box stuff, which you can deploy even if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker.
And so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket for cybercriminals.
And its creators were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial, because they were faced with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals.
And that challenge is: How do you do business, how do you trust somebody on the Web who you want to do business with when you know that they're a criminal?
It's axiomatic that they're dodgy, and they're going to want to try and rip you off.
So the family, as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known, came up with this brilliant idea called the escrow system.
They appointed an officer who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser.
The vendor, say, had stolen credit card details; the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them.
The purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally, and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details.
And the officer would then verify if the stolen credit card worked.
And if they did, he then passed on the money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser.
And it was this which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web.
And after that, it just went wild.
We had a champagne decade for people who we know as Carders.
Now I spoke to one of these Carders who we'll call RedBrigade -- although that wasn't even his proper nickname -- but I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was.
And he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004 he would go on sprees in New York, taking out $10,000 from an ATM here, $30,000 from an ATM there, using cloned credit cards.
He was making, on average a week, $150,000 -- tax free of course.
And he said that he had so much money stashed in his upper-East side apartment at one point that he just didn't know what to do with it and actually fell into a depression.
But that's a slightly different story, which I won't go into now.
Now the interesting thing about RedBrigade is that he wasn't an advanced hacker.
He sort of understood the technology, and he realized that security was very important if you were going to be a Carder, but he didn't spend his days and nights bent over a computer, eating pizza, drinking coke and that sort of thing.
He was out there on the town having a fab time enjoying the high life.
And this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise.
And often they're the most vulnerable element of all.
And I want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who I met while I was doing this research.
Dimitry Golubov, aka SCRIPT -- born in Odessa, Ukraine in 1982.
Now he developed his social and moral compass on the Black Sea port during the 1990s.
This was a sink-or-swim environment where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities was entirely necessary if you wanted to survive.
As an accomplished computer user, what Dimitry did was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown onto the Worldwide Web.
And he did a great job in it.
You have to understand though that from his ninth birthday, the only environment he knew was gangsterism.
He knew no other way of making a living and making money.
Then we have Renukanth Subramaniam, aka JiLsi -- founder of DarkMarket, born in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
As an eight year-old, he and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital because Singhalese mobs were roaming the city, looking for Tamils like Renu to murder.
At 11, he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military, accused of being a terrorist, and his parents sent him on his own to Britain as a refugee seeking political asylum.
At 13, with only little English and being bullied at school, he escaped into a world of computers where he showed great technical ability, but he was soon being seduced by people on the Internet.
He was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud, and he will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London in 2012.
Matrix001, who was an administrator at DarkMarket.
Born in Southern Germany to a stable and well-respected middle class family, his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking.
And he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated.
His slide into criminality was incremental.
And when he finally woke up to his situation and understood the implications, he was already in too deep.
Max Vision, aka ICEMAN -- mastermind of cardersMarket.
Born in Meridian, Idaho.
Max Vision was one of the best penetration testers working out of Santa Clara, California in the late 90s for private companies and voluntarily for the FBI.
Now in the late 1990s, he discovered a vulnerability on all U.S. government networks, and he went in and patched it up -- because this included nuclear research facilities -- sparing the American government a huge security embarrassment.
But also, because he was an inveterate hacker, he left a tiny digital wormhole through which he alone could crawl.
But this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator, and he was convicted.
At his open prison, he came under the influence of financial fraudsters, and those financial fraudsters persuaded him to work for them on his release.
And this man with a planetary-sized brain is now serving a 13-year sentence in California.
Adewale Taiwo, aka FeddyBB -- master bank account cracker from Abuja in Nigeria.
He set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup, bankfrauds@yahoo.co.uk before arriving in Britain in 2005 to take a Masters in chemical engineering at Manchester University.
He impressed in the private sector, developing chemical applications for the oil industry while simultaneously running a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions until his arrest in 2008.
And then finally, Cagatay Evyapan, aka Cha0 -- one of the most remarkable hackers ever, from Ankara in Turkey.
He combined the tremendous skills of a geek with the suave social engineering skills of the master criminal.
One of the smartest people I've ever met.
He also had the most effective virtual private network security arrangement the police have ever encountered amongst global cybercriminals.
Now the important thing about all of these people is they share certain characteristics despite the fact that they come from very different environments.
They are all people who learned their hacking skills in their early to mid-teens.
They are all people who demonstrate advanced ability in maths and the sciences.
Remember that, when they developed those hacking skills, their moral compass had not yet developed.
And most of them, with the exception of SCRIPT and Cha0, they did not demonstrate any real social skills in the outside world -- only on the Web.
And the other thing is the high incidence of hackers like these who have characteristics which are consistent with Asperger's syndrome.
Now I discussed this with Professor Simon Baron-Cohen who's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge.
And he has done path-breaking work on autism and confirmed, also for the authorities here, that Gary McKinnon -- who is wanted by the United States for hacking into the Pentagon -- suffers from Asperger's and a secondary condition of depression.
And Baron-Cohen explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills, and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities and skills because they have lost their way socially or been duped.
Now I think we're missing a trick here, because I don't think people like Max Vision should be in jail.
And let me be blunt about this.
In China, in Russia and in loads of other countries that are developing cyber-offensive capabilities, this is exactly what they are doing.
They are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities -- are mobilizing them on behalf of the state.
We need to engage and find ways of offering guidance to these young people, because they are a remarkable breed.
And if we rely, as we do at the moment, solely on the criminal justice system and the threat of punitive sentences, we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame.
Thank you very much for listening.
So your idea worth spreading is hire hackers.
How would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole?
MG: I think to an extent, you have to understand that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that.
They're just relentless and obsessive about what they do.
But all of the people who I've spoken to who have fallen foul of the law, they have all said, "Please, please give us a chance to work in the legitimate industry.
We just never knew how to get there, what we were doing.
We want to work with you."
Okay, well that makes sense. Thanks a lot Misha.

In the last 50 years, we've been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences.
And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that I think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next 50 years is going to be retrofitting suburbia.
So whether it's redeveloping dying malls or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots, I think the fact is the growing number of empty and under-performing, especially retail, sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least-sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places.
And in the process, what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost, and have the infrastructure in place, instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges.
So why is this important?
I think there are any number of reasons, and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.
Just from the perspective of climate change, the average urban dweller in the U.S.
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller, mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more, and living in detached buildings, you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of.
So strictly from the cities are already relatively green.
The big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs.
All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs, we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.
It's increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency.
We're just driving so much more; we haven't been able to keep up technologically.
Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting.
Researchers at the CDC and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles.
And those have been linked then with the rather alarming, growing rates of obesity, shown in these maps here, and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes.
And that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore, again, because of our development patterns.
And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question.
I mean, how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices?
Suburban expansion to cheap land, for the last 50 years -- you know the cheap land out on the edge -- has helped generations of families enjoy the American dream.
But increasingly, the savings promised by drive-till-you-qualify affordability -- which is basically our model -- those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs.
For instance, here in Atlanta, about half of households make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year, and they are spending 29 percent of their income on housing and 32 percent on transportation.
I mean, that's 2005 figures.
That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.
You know, none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs, and they're not going down any time soon.
Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips, there are reasons why it's important to retrofit.
But is it practical?
I think it is.
June Williamson and I have been researching this topic for over a decade, and we've found over 80 varied projects.
But that they're really all market driven, and what's driving the market in particular -- number one -- is major demographic shifts.
We all tend to think of suburbia as this very family-focused place, but that's really not the case anymore.
Since 2000, already two-thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them.
We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.
The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now: the Baby Boomers retiring -- and then there's a gap, Generation X, which is a small generation.
They're still having kids -- but Generation Y hasn't even started hitting child-rearing age.
They're the other big generation.
So as a result of that, demographers predict that through 2025, 75 to 85 percent of new households will not have kids in them.
And the market research, consumer research, asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like, what they would like to live in, tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we're already seeing it -- for more urban lifestyles within suburbia.
That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place, and Gen Y would like to live an urban lifestyle, but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.
The other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt.
Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band, but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots -- and suburbia is full of them.
When the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown, it made sense to just build surface parking lots.
But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again, as we've just continued to sprawl, and they now have a relatively central location.
It no longer just makes sense.
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.
It now makes sense to go back in, build a deck and build up on those sites.
So what do you do with a dead mall, dead office park?
It turns out, all sorts of things.
In a slow economy like ours, re-inhabitation is one of the more popular strategies.
So this happens to be a dead mall in St. Louis that's been re-inhabited as art-space.
It's now home to artist studios, theater groups, dance troupes.
It's not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was, but it's serving its community.
It's keeping the lights on.
It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.
Other malls have been re-inhabited as nursing homes, as universities, and as all variety of office space.
We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools, lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one.
This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store, that is now a public library.
In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse, they tore up some of the parking spaces, put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff, put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods.
And they've made this, what was just a store along a commercial strip, into a community gathering space.
This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix, Arizona.
Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint, a gourmet grocery, and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.
Never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination.
It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.
The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim, "Walking distance to Le Grande Orange," because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call "a third place."
If home is the first place and work is the second place, the third place is where you go to hang out and build community.
And especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family, the family households, there's a real hunger for more third places.
So the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category, the next strategy: redevelopment.
Now, during the boom, there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density, a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.
But some of them have been much more incremental.
This is Mashpee Commons, the oldest retrofit that we've found.
And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years, built urbanism on top of its parking lots.
So the black and white photo shows the simple 60's strip shopping center.
And then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact, mixed-use New England village, and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side.
So, you know, sometimes it's incremental.
Sometimes, it's all at once.
This is another infill project on the parking lots, this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.
When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site, the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots and condo buildings, while keeping the existing office buildings.
Here is the site in 1940: It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville.
By 1980, it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right.
Today, the transit, the Main Street and the new housing have all been built.
Eventually, I expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.
Plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped.
Transit is a big driver of retrofits.
So here's what it looks like.
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street.
This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.
I think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction.
There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines.
This was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock.
It's now 22 walkable urban blocks with public streets, two public parks, eight bus lines and a range of housing types, and so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had.
Here was the mall in its heyday.
They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall.
So here's the site in 1975 with the mall.
By 1995, the mall has died.
The department store has been kept -- and we found this was true in many cases.
The department stores are multistory; they're better built.
They're easy to be re-adapted.
But the one story stuff ...
that's really history.
So here it is at projected build-out.
This project, I think, has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods.
It's providing 1,500 households with the option of a more urban lifestyle.
It's about two-thirds built out right now.
Here's what the new Main Street looks like.
It's very successful, and it's helped to prompt -- eight of the 13 regional malls in Denver have now, or have announced plans to be, retrofitted.
But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring -- No, it's pockets of walkability on the sites of under-performing properties.
And so it's giving people more choices, but it's not taking away choices.
But it's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability.
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation.
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.
So this is one that has been retrofitted in California.
They took the commercial strip shown on the black-and-white images below, and they built a boulevard that has become the Main Street for their town.
And it's transformed from being an ugly, unsafe, undesirable address, to becoming a beautiful, attractive, dignified sort of good address.
I mean now we're hoping we start to see it; they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.
I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree.
So there's a lot of great things, but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting.
But densification is not going to work everywhere.
Sometimes re-greening is really the better answer.
There's a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like Flint, Michigan.
There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement -- sort of victory gardens meets the Internet.
But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology, as in this example outside of Minneapolis.
When the shopping center died, the city restored the site's original wetlands, creating lakefront property, which then attracted private investment, the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood in over 40 years.
So they've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time.
This is another re-greening example.
It also makes sense in very strong markets.
This one in Seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot adjacent to a new transit stop.
And the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot.
But daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat.
So I've shown you some of the first generation of retrofits.
What's next?
I think we have three challenges for the future.
The first is to plan retrofitting much more systemically at the metropolitan scale.
We need to be able to target which areas really should be re-greened.
Where should we be redeveloping?
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation?
These slides just show two images from a larger project that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta.
I led a team that was asked to imagine Atlanta 100 years from now.
And we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves -- expensive, but simple.
One, in a hundred years, transit on all major rail and road corridors.
Two, in a hundred years, thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors.
It's a little extreme, but we've got a little water problem.
In a hundred years, subdivisions that simply end up too close to water or too far from transit won't be viable.
And so we've created the eco-acre transfer-to-transfer development rights to the transit corridors and allow the re-greening of those former subdivisions for food and energy production.
So the second challenge is to improve the architectural design quality of the retrofits.
And I close with this image of democracy in action: This is a protest that's happening on a retrofit in Silver Spring, Maryland on an Astroturf town green.
Now, retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism, and not without reason; you don't get much more phony than an Astroturf town green.
I have to say, these are very hybrid places.
They are new but trying to look old.
They have urban streetscapes, but suburban parking ratios.
Their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia, but they're less diverse than cities.
And they are public places, but that are managed by private companies.
And just the surface appearance are often -- like the Astroturf here -- they make me wince.
So, you know, I mean I'm glad that the urbanism is doing its job.
The fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks, the streets and blocks, the putting in of public space, compromised as it may be, is still a really great thing.
But we've got to get the architecture better.
The final challenge is for all of you.
I want you to join the protest and start demanding more sustainable suburban places -- more sustainable places, period.
But culturally, we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic, and we expect that.
But we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to.
It's time to let them grow up, so I want you to all support the zoning changes, the road diets, the infrastructure improvements and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you.
Thank you.

<title>Ellen Dunham-Jones: Retrofitting suburbia</title>
<description>Ellen Dunham-Jones fires the starting shot for the next 50 years' big sustainable design project: retrofitting suburbia. To come: Dying malls rehabilitated, dead "big box" stores re-inhabited, parking lots transformed into thriving wetlands. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

I bet you're worried.
I was worried. That's why I began this piece.
I was worried about vaginas. I was worried what we think about vaginas, and even more worried that we don't think about them.
I was worried about my own vagina.
It needed a context, a culture, a community of other vaginas.
There is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them.
Like the Bermuda Triangle, nobody ever reports back from there.
In the first place, it's not so easy to even find your vagina.
Women go days, weeks, months, without looking at it.
I interviewed a high-powered businesswoman; she told me she didn't have time.
"Looking at your vagina," she said, "is a full day's work."
"You've got to get down there on your back, in front of a mirror, full-length preferred. You've got to get in the perfect position, with the perfect light, which then becomes shadowed by the angle you're at.
You're twisting your head up, arching your back, it's exhausting."
She was busy; she didn't have time.
So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas.
They began as casual vagina interviews, and they turned into vagina monologues.
I talked with over 200 women. I talked to older women, younger women, married women, lesbians, single women; I talked to corporate professionals, college professors, actors, sex workers; I talked to African-American women, Asian-American women, Native-American women, Caucasian women, Jewish women.
OK, at first women were a little shy, a little reluctant to talk.
Once they got going, you couldn't stop them.
Women love to talk about their vaginas -- they do.
Mainly because no one's ever asked them before.
Let's just start with the word "vagina" -- vagina, vagina.
It sounds like an infection at best. Maybe a medical instrument.
"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina."
Vagina, vagina, vagina. It doesn't matter how many times you say the word, it never sounds like a word you want to say.
It's a completely ridiculous, totally un-sexy word.
If you use it during sex, trying to be politically correct, "Darling, would you stroke my vagina," you kill the act right there.
I'm worried what we call them and don't call them.
In Great Neck, New York, they call it a "pussy-cat."
A woman told me there, her mother used to tell her, "Don't wear panties, dear, underneath your pajamas.
You need to air out your pussy-cat."
In Westchester they call it a "pooky," in New Jersey a "twat."
There's powder-box, derriere, a pooky, a poochy, a poopy, a poopaloo, a pooninana, a padepachetchki, a pow, and a peach.
There's toadie, dee dee, nishi, dignity, coochie snorcher, cooter, labi, gladis siegelman, va, wee-wee, whore-spot, nappy dugout, mungo, ghoulie, powder-box, a "mimi" in Miami, a "split knish" in Philadelphia, and a "schmende" in the Bronx.
I am worried about vaginas.
This is how the "Vagina Monologues" begins.
But it really didn't begin there; it began with a conversation with a woman.
We were having a conversation about menopause, and we got onto the subject of her vagina -- which you'll do if you're talking about menopause.
And she said things that really shocked me about her vagina -- that it was dried-up and finished and dead -- and I was kind of shocked.
And so I said to a friend casually, "Well, what do you think about your vagina?"
And that woman said something more amazing, and then the next woman said something more amazing, and before I knew it, every woman was telling me I had to talk to somebody about their vagina because they had an amazing story, and I was sucked down the vagina trail.
And I really haven't gotten off it. I think if you had told me when I was younger that I was going to grow up, and be in shoe stores, and people were going to scream out, "There she is, the Vagina Lady!"
I don't know that that would have been my life ambition.
But I want to talk a little bit about happiness and the relationship to this whole vagina journey because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago.
I think before I did the "Vagina Monologues" I didn't really believe in happiness.
I thought that only idiots were happy, to be honest.
I remember when I started practicing Buddhism 14 years ago, and I was told that the end of this practice was to be happy, I said, "How could you be happy and live in this world of suffering and live in this world of pain?" I mistook happiness for a lot of other things, like numbness or decadence or selfishness.
And what happened through the course of the "Vagina Monologues" and this journey is I think I have come to understand a little bit more about happiness.
There're three qualities I want to talk about.
One is seeing what's right in front of you, and talking about it, and stating it. I think what I learned from talking about the vagina, and speaking about the vagina, is it was the most obvious thing -- it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world -- and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about.
The second thing is that what talking about the vagina did is it opened this door which allowed me to see that there was a way to serve the world to make it better.
And that's where the deepest happiness has actually come from.
And the third principle of happiness, which I've realized recently.
Eight years ago, this momentum and this energy, this "V-wave" started -- and I can only describe it as a "V-wave" because, to be honest, I really don't understand it completely; I feel at the service of it.
But this wave started, and if I question the wave, or try to stop the wave or look back at the wave, I often have the experience of whiplash or the potential of my neck breaking. But if I go with the wave, and I trust the wave and I move with the wave, I go to the next place, and it happens logically and organically and truthfully.
And I started this piece, particularly with stories and narratives, and I was talking to one woman and that led to another woman and that led to another woman, and then I wrote those stories down and I put them out in front of other people.
And every single time I did the show at the beginning, women would literally line up after the show because they wanted to tell me their stories.
And at first I thought, "Oh great, I'll hear about wonderful orgasms, and great sex lives, and how women love their vaginas."
But in fact, that's not what women lined up to tell me.
What women lined up to tell me was how they were raped, and how they were battered, and how they were beaten, and how they were gang-raped in parking lots, and how they were incested by their uncles.
And I wanted to stop doing the "Vagina Monologues" because it felt too daunting. I felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events, but doesn't intervene on their behalf.
And so in 1997, I said, "Let's get women together.
What could we do with this information that all these women are being violated?"
And it turned out, after thinking and investigating, that I discovered -- and the UN has actually said this recently -- that one out of every three women on this planet will be beaten or raped in her lifetime.
That's essentially a gender; that's essentially a resource of the planet, which is women.
So in 1997 we got all these incredible women together and we said, "How can we use the play, this energy, to stop violence against women?"
And we put on one event in New York City, in the theater, and all these great actors came -- from Susan Sarandon, to Glenn Close, to Whoopi Goldberg -- and we did one performance on one evening, and that catalyzed this wave, this energy.
And within five years, this extraordinary thing began to happen.
One woman took that energy and she said, "I want to bring this wave, this energy, to college campuses," and so she took the play and she said, "Let's use the play and have performances of the play once a year, where we can raise money to stop violence against women in local communities all around the world."
And in one year, it went to 50 colleges, and then it expanded.
And over the course of the last six years, it's spread and it's spread and it's spread and it's spread around the world.
What I have learned is two things. One: that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking; it's global; it is so profound and it is so devastating, and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater, of every little society, that we don't even recognize it because it's become ordinary. This journey has taken me to Afghanistan, where I had the extraordinary honor and privilege to go into parts of Afghanistan under the Taliban -- I was dressed in a burqa -- and I went in with an extraordinary group called the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan, and I saw firsthand how women had been stripped of every single right that was possible to strip women of -- from being educated, to being employed, to being actually allowed to eat ice cream.
For those of you who don't know it, it was illegal to eat ice cream under the Taliban.
And I actually saw and met women who had been flogged by being caught eating vanilla ice cream.
And I was taken to the secret ice cream-eating place in a little town, where we went to a back room, and women were seated and a curtain was pulled around us, and they were served vanilla ice cream.
And women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream, and I don't think I ever understood pleasure until that moment, and how women have found a way to keep their pleasure alive.
It has taken me, this journey, to Islamabad, where I have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off.
It has taken me to Juarez, Mexico, where I was a week ago, where I have literally been there in parking lots where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to Coca-Cola bottles.
It has taken me to universities all over this country where girls are date-raped and drugged.
I have seen terrible, terrible, terrible violence.
But I have also recognized, in the course of seeing that violence, that being in the face of things and seeing actually what's in front of us is the antidote to depression and to a feeling that one is worthless and has no value.
Because before the "Vagina Monologues," I will say that 80 percent of my consciousness was closed off to what was really going on in this reality.
And that closing-off closed off my vitality and my life energy.
What has also happened is in the course of these travels -- and it's been an extraordinary thing -- is that every single place that I have gone to in the world, I have met a new species.
And I really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea.
And I was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people on this particular panel that it's beneath, beyond, and between, and the vagina kind of fits into all those categories.
But one of the things I've seen is this species -- and it is a species, and it is a new paradigm, and it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media because I don't think good news ever is news, and I don't think people who are transforming the planet are what gets the ratings on TV shows.
But every single country I have been to -- and in the last six years I've been to about 45 countries, and many tiny little villages and cities and towns -- I have seen something what I've come to call "vagina warriors."
A "vagina warrior" is a woman, or a vagina-friendly man, who has witnessed incredible violence or suffered it, and rather than getting an AK-47 or a weapon of mass destruction or a machete, they hold the violence in their bodies; they grieve it; they experience it; and then they go out and devote their lives to making sure it doesn't happen to anybody else.
I have met these women everywhere on the planet.
And I want to tell a few stories because I believe that stories are the way that we transmit information, where it goes into our bodies. And I think that one of the things about being at TED that's been very interesting is that I live in my body a lot, and I don't live in my head very much anymore.
And this is a very heady place.
And it's been really interesting to be in my head for the last two days; I've been very disoriented -- because I think the world, the V-world, is very much in your body.
It's a body world, and the species really exists in the body, and I think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads -- that that separation has created a divide that is often separating purpose from intent.
And the connection between body and head often brings those things into union.
I want to talk about three particular people that I've met, vagina warriors, who really transformed my understanding of this whole principle and species, and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez.
Marsha Lopez was a woman I met in Guatemala.
She was 14 years old, and she was in a marriage and her husband was beating her on a regular basis, and she couldn't get out because she was addicted to the relationship and she had no money. Her sister was younger than her and she applied -- we had a "stop rape" contest a few years ago in New York -- and she applied, hoping that she would become a finalist and she could bring her sister.
She did become a finalist; she brought Marsha to New York.
And at that time we did this extraordinary V-Day at Madison Square Garden where we sold out the entire testosterone-filled dome, 18,000 people standing up to say "yes" to vaginas, which was really a pretty incredible transformation.
And she came, and she witnessed this, and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband, and that she would bring V-Day to Guatemala.
She was 21 years old. I went to Guatemala and she had sold out the National Theater of Guatemala.
And I watched her walk up on stage in her red short dress, and high heels, and she stood there and she said, "My name is Marsha.
I was beaten by my husband for five years.
He almost murdered me. I left and you can too."
And the entire 2,000 people went absolutely crazy.
There's a woman named Esther Chavez who I met in Juarez, Mexico. And Esther Chavez was a brilliant accountant in Mexico City; she was 72 years old; and she was planning to retire.
She went to Juarez to take care of an ailing aunt, and over the course of it, she began to discover what was happening to the murdered and disappeared women of Juarez.
She gave up her life; she moved to Juarez; she started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women.
300 women have disappeared in a border town because they're brown and poor.
There has been no response to the disappearance, and not one person has been held accountable.
She began to document it; she opened a center called Casa Amiga; and in six years, she has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world.
We were there a week ago, when there were 7,000 people on the street, and it was truly a miracle. And as we walked through the streets, the people of Juarez, who normally don't even come into the streets because the streets are so dangerous, literally stood there and wept to see that other people from the world had showed up for that particular community.
There's another woman named Agnes. And Agnes, for me, epitomizes what a vagina warrior is.
I met her three years ago in Kenya. And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl, she was circumcised against her will when she was 10 years old, and she really made a decision that she didn't want this practice to continue anymore in her community.
So when she got older she created this incredible thing: it's an anatomical sculpture of a woman's body; it's half a woman's body.
And she walked through the Rift Valley, and she had vagina and vagina replacement parts where she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls what a healthy vagina looks like, and what a mutilated vagina looks like. And in the course of her travel she walked literally for eight years through the Rift Valley, through dust, through sleeping on the ground -- because the Masais are nomads, and she would literally have to find them, and they would move, and she would find them again. She saved 1,500 girls from being cut.
And in that time she created an alternative ritual which involved girls coming of age without the cut.
When we met her three years ago, we said, "What could V-Day do for you?"
And she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep, I could get around a lot faster."
So we bought her a Jeep. And in the year that she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut. So then we said to her, "Agnes, well, what else could we do for you?" And she said, "Well, Eve, you know, if you gave me some money, I could open a house and girls could run away and they could be saved."
And I want to tell this little story about my own beginnings because it's very interrelated to happiness and Agnes.
When I was a little girl -- and I grew up in a wealthy community; it was an upper-middle class white community, and it had all the trappings and the looks of a perfectly nice, wonderful, great life.
And everyone was supposed to be happy in that community and, in fact, my life was hell. I lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me, and it was all inside that.
And always as a child I had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me.
And I actually made up a little character whose name was Mr. Alligator, and I would call him up when things got really bad, and I would say it was time to come and pick me up.
And I would go and pack a little bag and I would wait for Mr. Alligator to come.
Now, Mr. Alligator never did come, but the idea of Mr. Alligator coming actually saved my sanity and made it OK for me to keep going because I believed, in the distance, there would be someone coming to rescue me.
Cut to 40-some-odd years later, we go to Kenya, and we're walking, we arrive at the opening of this house -- and Agnes hadn't let me come to the house for days because they were preparing this whole ritual.
And I want to tell you a great story. When Agnes first started fighting to stop female genital mutilation in her community, she had become an outcast, and she was exiled and she was slandered, and the whole community turned against her.
But, being a vagina warrior, she kept going, and she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness.
And in the Masai community, goats and cows are the most valued possession.
They're like the Mercedes-Benz of the Rift Valley.
And she said, two days before the house opened, two different people arrived to give her a goat each, and she said to me, "I knew then that female genital mutilation would end one day in Africa."
Anyway, we arrived, and when we arrived, there were hundreds of girls dressed in red, homemade dresses -- which is the color of the Masai and the color of V-Day -- and they greeted us, and they had made up these songs that they were singing about the end of suffering, and the end of mutilation, and they walked us down the path.
And it was a gorgeous day in the African sun, and the dust was flying and the girls were dancing, and there was this house, and it said, "V-Day Safe House for the Girls."
And it hit me in that moment that it had taken 47 years, but that Mr. Alligator had finally shown up.
And he'd show up obviously in a form that it took me a long time to understand, which is that when we give in the world what we want the most, we heal the broken part inside each of us.
And I feel, in the last eight years, that this journey, this miraculous vagina journey, has taught me this really simple thing, which is that happiness exists in action; it exists in telling the truth and saying what your truth is; and it exists in giving away what you want the most.
And I feel that knowledge and that journey has been an extraordinary privilege, and I feel really blessed to have been here today to communicate that to you.
Thank you very much.

Like many of you, I'm one of the lucky people.
I was born to a family where education was pervasive.
I'm a third-generation PhD, a daughter of two academics.
In my childhood, I played around in my father's university lab.
So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities, which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity.
Unfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.
In some parts of the world, for example, South Africa, education is just not readily accessible.
In South Africa, the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority.
And as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education.
That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year at the University of Johannesburg.
There were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process, and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration, thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long, hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.
When the gates opened, there was a stampede, and 20 people were injured and one woman died.
She was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life.
But even in parts of the world like the United States where education is available, it might not be within reach.
There has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care.
What might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate, for a total of 559 percent since 1985.
This makes education unaffordable for many people.
Finally, even for those who do manage to get the higher education, the doors of opportunity might not open.
Only a little over half of recent college graduates in the United States who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education.
This, of course, is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions, but for many others, they do not get the value for their time and their effort.
Tom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article, captured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.
He said the big breakthroughs are what happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.
I've talked about what's desperately necessary.
Let's talk about what's suddenly possible.
What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by three big Stanford classes, each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.
So to understand this, let's look at one of those classes, the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague and cofounder Andrew Ng.
Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.
It's a Machine Learning class, and it has 400 people enrolled every time it's offered.
When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public, it had 100,000 people registered.
So to put that number in perspective, for Andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a Stanford class, he would have to do that for 250 years.
Of course, he'd get really bored.
So, having seen the impact of this, Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up, to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.
So we formed Coursera, whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free.
We currently have 43 courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines, and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like.
Robert Ghrist: Welcome to Calculus.
Ezekiel Emanuel: Fifty million people are uninsured.
Scott Page: Models help us design more effective institutions and policies.
We get unbelievable segregation.
Scott Klemmer: So Bush imagined that in the future, you'd wear a camera right in the center of your head.
Mitchell Duneier: Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...
RG: Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine.
Nick Parlante: For each pixel in the image, set the red to zero.
Paul Offit: ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus.
Dan Jurafsky: Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose? Well, that sounds funny.
Daphne Koller: So this is which coin you pick, and this is the two tosses.
Andrew Ng: So in large-scale machine learning, we'd like to come up with computational ...
It turns out, maybe not surprisingly, that students like getting the best content from the best universities for free.
Since we opened the website in February, we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.
We have 1.5 million enrollments, 6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched so far have been submitted, and 14 million videos have been viewed.
But it's not just about the numbers, it's also about the people.
Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India and would never have access in this case to a Stanford-quality course and would never be able to afford it.
Or Jenny, who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master's degree.
Or Ryan, who can't go to school, because his immune deficient daughter can't be risked to have germs come into the house, so he couldn't leave the house.
I'm really glad to say -- recently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan -- that this story had a happy ending.
Baby Shannon -- you can see her on the left -- is doing much better now, and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses.
So what made these courses so different?
After all, online course content has been available for a while.
What made it different was that this was real course experience.
It started on a given day, and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments.
And these would be real homework assignments for a real grade, with a real deadline.
You can see the deadlines and the usage graph.
These are the spikes showing that procrastination is global phenomenon.
At the end of the course, the students got a certificate.
They could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job, and we know many students who did.
Some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit.
So these students were really getting something meaningful for their investment of time and effort.
Let's talk a little bit about some of the components that go into these courses.
The first component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format, you can break away from, for example, the monolithic one-hour lecture.
You can break up the material, for example, into these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes, each of which represents a coherent concept.
Students can traverse this material in different ways, depending on their background, their skills or their interests.
So, for example, some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have.
Other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.
So this format allows us to break away from the one-size-fits-all model of education, and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.
Of course, we all know as educators that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.
Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it.
There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.
This one that appeared in Science last year, for example, demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice, where students are just supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions.
We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform, as well as other forms of practice in many ways.
For example, even our videos are not just videos.
Every few minutes, the video pauses and the students get asked a question.
SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting, status quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented.
So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.
So here the video pauses, and the student types in the answer into the box and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention.
So they get to try again, and this time they got it right.
There's an optional explanation if they want.
And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.
This is a kind of simple question that I as an instructor might ask in class, but when I ask that kind of a question in class, 80 percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing I said, 15 percent are zoned out on Facebook, and then there's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it, and I as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer.
And so the lecture moves on before, really, most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.
Here, every single student has to engage with the material.
And of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story.
One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions, and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions.
Now, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students if you do not have 10,000 TAs?
The answer is, you need to use technology to do it for you.
Now, fortunately, technology has come a long way, and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework.
In addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video, we can also grade math, mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations.
We can grade models, whether it's financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.
Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple but fairly visual.
This is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class, and the students are supposed to color-correct that blurry red image.
They're typing their program into the browser, and you can see they didn't get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.
And so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that, and they can move on to the next assignment.
This ability to interact actively with the material and be told when you're right or wrong is really essential to student learning.
Now, of course we cannot yet grade the range of work that one needs for all courses.
Specifically, what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.
So we tried to convince, for example, some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.
That didn't go over really well.
So we had to come up with a different solution.
And the solution we ended up using is peer grading.
It turns out that previous studies show, like this one by Saddler and Good, that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades.
It was tried only in small classes, but there it showed, for example, that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.
What's even more surprising is that self-grades, where the students grade their own work critically -- so long as you incentivize them properly so they can't give themselves a perfect score -- are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.
And so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale, and is also a useful learning strategy for the students, because they actually learn from the experience.
So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised, where tens of thousands of students are grading each other's work, and quite successfully, I have to say.
But this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems.
Around each one of our courses, a community of students had formed, a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor.
What you see here is a self-generated map from students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course, where they have put themselves on a world map, and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort.
Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.
First of all, there was a question and answer forum, where students would pose questions, and other students would answer those questions.
And the really amazing thing is, because there were so many students, it means that even if a student posed a question at 3 o'clock in the morning, somewhere around the world, there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem.
And so, in many of our courses, the median response time for a question on the question and answer forum was 22 minutes.
Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.
And you can see from the student testimonials that students actually find that because of this large online community, they got to interact with each other in many ways that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom.
Students also self-assembled, without any kind of intervention from us, into small study groups.
Some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.
This is the San Francisco study group, but there were ones all over the world.
Others were virtual study groups, sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines, and on the bottom left there, you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures.
There are some tremendous opportunities to be had from this kind of framework.
The first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning.
Because the data that we can collect here is unique.
You can collect every click, every homework submission, every forum post from tens of thousands of students.
So you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis-driven mode to the data-driven mode, a transformation that, for example, has revolutionized biology.
You can use these data to understand fundamental questions like, what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not?
And in the context of particular courses, you can ask questions like, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them?
So here's an example of that, also from Andrew's Machine Learning class.
This is a distribution of wrong answers to one of Andrew's assignments.
The answers happen to be pairs of numbers, so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot.
Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.
The big cross at the top left is where 2,000 students gave the exact same wrong answer.
Now, if two students in a class of 100 give the same wrong answer, you would never notice.
But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer, it's kind of hard to miss.
So Andrew and his students went in, looked at some of those assignments, understood the root cause of the misconception, and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket, which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.
So this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers.
Personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well, because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30-year-old problem.
Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984, posed what's called the 2 sigma problem, which he observed by studying three populations.
The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.
The second is a population of students that studied using a standard lecture-based classroom, but with a mastery-based approach, so the students couldn't move on to the next topic before demonstrating mastery of the previous one.
And finally, there was a population of students that were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor.
The mastery-based population was a full standard deviation, or sigma, in achievement scores better than the standard lecture-based class, and the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma improvement in performance.
To understand what that means, let's look at the lecture-based classroom, and let's pick the median performance as a threshold.
So in a lecture-based class, half the students are above that level and half are below.
In the individual tutoring instruction, 98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold.
Imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students would be above average.
Hence, the 2 sigma problem.
Because we cannot afford, as a society, to provide every student with an individual human tutor.
But maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone.
So the question is, how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve, to the right side with the green curve?
Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer, because a computer doesn't get tired of showing you the same video five times.
And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times, we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you.
And even personalization is something that we're starting to see the beginnings of, whether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you.
So the goal here is to try and push, and see how far we can get towards the green curve.
So, if this is so great, are universities now obsolete?
Well, Mark Twain certainly thought so.
He said that, "College is a place where a professor's lecture notes go straight to the students' lecture notes, without passing through the brains of either."
I beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.
I think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture-based format that so many universities spend so much time on.
So let's go back even further, to Plutarch, who said that, "The mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting."
And maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our students' minds with content by lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity, their imagination and their problem-solving skills by actually talking with them.
So how do we do that?
We do that by doing active learning in the classroom.
So there's been many studies, including this one, that show that if you use active learning, interacting with your students in the classroom, performance improves on every single metric -- on attendance, on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test.
You can see, for example, that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment.
So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities.
So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free, what would that do? Three things.
First it would establish education as a fundamental human right, where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves, their families and their communities.
Second, it would enable lifelong learning.
It's a shame that for so many people, learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college.
By having this amazing content be available, we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted, whether it's just to expand our minds or it's to change our lives.
And finally, this would enable a wave of innovation, because amazing talent can be found anywhere.
Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa.
And if we could offer that person an education, they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us.
Thank you very much.

I am going to talk about myself, which I rarely do, because I -- well for one thing, I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about.
And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.
I didn't know I was a narcissist actually.
I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself.
And then someone told me there is a flip side to it.
So it's actually drearier than self-love; it's unrequited self-love.
I don't feel I can afford a relapse.
But I want to, though, explain how I came to design my own particular brand of comedy because I've been through so many different forms of it.
I started with improvisation, in a particular form of improvisation called theater games, which had one rule, which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society.
And the rule was, you couldn't deny the other person's reality, you could only build on it.
And of course we live in a society that's all about contradicting other peoples' reality.
It's all about contradiction, which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general.
I see it everywhere.
Like polls. You know, it's always curious to me that in public opinion polls the percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question is always two percent.
75 percent of Americans think Alaska is part of Canada.
But only two percent don't know the effect that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy -- seems a contradiction.
Or this ad that I read in the New York Times: "Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society.
Buying it from us screams good taste."
Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer, in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron.
"Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts."
"Don't use big words."
"Learn the lingua franca."
Yeah. "Lingua this, Frankie."
And I suppose it's a contradiction that I talk about science when I don't know math.
You know, because -- and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen for pointing out that one of the reasons, that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology -- because for instance, the reason I don't do math is, I was taught to do math and read at the same time.
So you're six years old, you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, and it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world: dwarves and Prince Charmings.
And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince.
That's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing.
Of course, by talking about science I also may, as I did the other night, incur the violent wrath of some scientists who were very upset with me.
I used the word postmodern as if it were OK.
And they got very upset.
One of them, to his credit, I think really just wanted to engage me in a serious argument.
But I don't engage in serious arguments.
I don't approve of them because arguments, of course, are all about contradiction, and they're shaped by the values that I have questions with.
I have questions with the values of Newtonian science, like rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument.
Well rationality is constructed by what Christie Hefner was talking about today, that mind-body split, you know?
The head is good, body bad.
Head is ego, body id.
When we say "I," -- as when Rene Descartes said, "I think therefore I am," -- we mean the head.
And as David Lee Roth sang in "Just a Gigolo," "I ain't got no body."
That's how you get rationality.
And that's why so much of humor is the body asserting itself against the head.
That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor.
That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers whacking Richard in the genital area.
And we're laughing doubly then because he's the body, but it's also -- Voice offstage: Richard.
Emily Levine: Richard. What did I say?
Richard. Yes but it's also the head, the head of the conference.
That's the other way that humor -- like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state.
It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure -- but nevertheless, what makes us treasure you and adore you.
There's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though, which is, as much as we revere the head, we are very anti-intellectual.
I know this because I read in the New York Times, the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page ad after September 11, in which they said, "The problem is not Iraq or Iran, the problem in this country, facing this country is the university professors and their spawn."
So I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead."
I don't know how many of you have read it.
And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism.
But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217.
"The act of a master taking painful contemptuous possession of her, was the kind of rapture she wanted.
When they lay together in bed it was, as it had to be, as the nature of the act demanded, an act of violence.
It was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable.
Not a caress, but a wave of pain.
The agony as an act of passion."
So you can imagine my surprise on reading in The New Yorker that Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor.
It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.
Bad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress.
Now we have to picture Alan Greenspan in a black leather corset, with a butt tattoo that says, "Whip inflation now."
And Ayn Rand of course, Ayn Rand is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism, which reflects another value of Newtonian physics, which is objectivity.
Objectivity basically is constructed in that same S&amp;M way.
It's the subject subjugating the object.
That's how you assert yourself.
You make yourself the active voice.
And the object is the passive no-voice.
I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial.
I don't know if you know this but -- maybe it's different now, or maybe you were making a statement -- but in many hospital nurseries across the country, until very recently anyway, according to a book by Jessica Benjamin, the signs over the little boys cribs read, "I'm a boy," and the signs over the little girls cribs read, "It's a girl." Yeah.
So the passivity was culturally projected onto the little girls.
And this still goes on as I think I told you last year.
There's a poll that proves -- there was a poll that was given by Time magazine, in which only men were asked, "Have you ever had sex with a woman you actively disliked?"
And well, yeah.
Well, 58 percent said yes, which I think is overinflated though because so many men if you just say, "Have you ever had sex ... " "Yes!"
They don't even wait for the rest of it.
And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had -- That's the first callback, of my attempted quadruple.
So this subject-object thing, is part of something I'm very interested in because this is why, frankly, I believe in political correctness.
I do. I think it can go too far.
I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.
"We have a lifelong emotional and financial commitment to our Asian Elephant partners."
Maybe too far. But you know -- I don't think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color.
Or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women.
Or poor people making fun of rich people, the same as rich people.
I think you can make fun of the have but not the have-nots, which is why you don't see me making fun of Kenneth Lay and his charming wife.
What's funny about being down to four houses?
And I really learned this lesson during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or, Or as I call them, the good ol' days.
When people I knew, you know, people who considered themselves liberal, and everything else, were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones.
Basically, they were making fun of them for being trailer trash or white trash.
It seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudice and that you're not really hurting anybody.
Until you read, as I did, an ad in the Los Angeles Times.
"For sale: White trash compactor."
So this whole subject-object thing has relevance to humor in this way.
I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin, who is the chair of the Classics department at USC.
And the book is called "The Garden of Priapus."
And she says that Roman humor mirrors the construction of Roman society.
So that Roman society was very top/bottom, as ours is to some degree.
And so was humor.
There always had to be the butt of a joke.
So it was always the satirist, like Juvenal or Martial, represented the audience, and he was going to make fun of the outsider, the person who didn't share that subject status.
And in stand-up of course, the stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience.
A lot of heckling is the tension of trying to make sure that the comedian is going to be able to dominate, and overcome the heckler.
And I got good at that when I was in stand up.
But I always hated it because they were dictating the terms of the interaction, in the same way that engaging in a serious argument determines the content, to some degree, of what you're talking about.
And I was looking for a form that didn't have that.
And so I wanted something that was more interactive.
I know that word is so debased now by the use of it by Internet marketers.
I really miss the old telemarketers now, I'll tell you that.
I do, because at least there you stood a chance. You know?
I used to actually hang up on them.
But then I read in "Dear Abby" that that was rude.
So the next time that one called I let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said, "You sound sexy."
He hung up on me!
But the interactivity allows the audience to shape what you're going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world.
And that's really what I'm looking for.
And I was sort of, as I was starting to analyze what exactly it is that I do, I read a book called "Trickster Makes This World," by Lewis Hyde.
And it was like being psychoanalyzed.
I mean he had laid it all out.
And then coming to this conference, I realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change.
Trickster is a change agent.
And the qualities that I'm about to describe are the qualities that make it possible to make change happen.
And one of these is boundary crossing.
I think this is what so, in fact, infuriated the scientists.
But I like to cross boundaries.
I like to, as I said, talk about things I know nothing about.
I hope that's my agent, because you aren't paying me anything.
And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know?
I'm able to see the contradiction that you may not be able to see.
Like for instance a mime once -- or a meme as he called himself.
He was a very selfish meme.
And he said that I had to show more respect because it took up to 18 years to learn how to do mime properly.
And I said, "Well, that's how you know only stupid people go into it."
It only takes two years to learn how to talk.
And you know people, this is the problem with quote, objectivity, unquote.
When you're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you, or share the same set of assumptions as you, you start to think that that's reality.
Like economists, you know, their definition of rational, that we all act out of our own economic self-interest.
Well, look at Michael Hawley, or look at Dean Kamen, or look at my grandmother.
My grandmother always acted in other people's interests, whether they wanted her to or not.
If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom, my grandmother would have lost on purpose.
"No, you take the prize.
You're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it?
Where am I going? I'm going to die soon."
So that's one -- this boundary crossing, this go-between which -- Fritz Lanting, is that his name, actually said that he was a go-between.
That's an actual quality of the trickster.
And another is, non-oppositional strategies.
And this is instead of contradiction.
Where you deny the other person's reality, you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist, I think there's another philosophical construction.
I'm not sure what it's called.
But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store.
It said, "Ears pierced while you wait."
There the alternative just boggles the imagination.
"Oh no. Thanks though, I'll leave them here. Thanks very much.
I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up around five, if that's OK with you.
Huh? Huh? What? Can't hear you."
And another attribute of the trickster is smart luck.
That accidents, that Louis Kahn, who talked about accidents, this is another quality of the trickster.
The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared.
That, and I will say this to the scientists, that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas.
I had no joke for that.
I just wanted to put the scientists in their place.
But here's how I think I like to make change, and that is in making connections.
This is what I tend to see almost more than contradictions.
Like the, what do you call those toes of the gecko?
You know, the toes of the gecko, curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen.
I love connections.
Like I'll read that one of the two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe -- there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe -- one is space occupancy. Matter takes up space.
I guess the more you matter the more space you take up, which explains the whole SUV phenomenon.
And the other one though is impenetrability.
Well, in ancient Rome, impenetrability was the criterion of masculinity.
Masculinity depended on you being the active penetrator.
And then, in economics, there's an active producer and a passive consumer, which explains why business always has to penetrate new markets.
Well yeah, I mean why we forced China to open her markets.
And didn't that feel good?
And now we're being penetrated.
You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes.
You know we're being penetrated.
And I suspect, by someone who actively dislikes us.
That's the second of the quadruple.
Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much.
I still have a way to go.
And what I hope to do, when I make these connections, is short circuit people's thinking.
You know, make you not follow your usual train of association, but make you rewire.
It literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition, it's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think -- I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it.
I'm so sorry. I'm getting like the woman in that joke about -- have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother?
And the mother is elderly.
And the mother goes right through a red light.
And the daughter doesn't want to say anything.
She doesn't want to be like, "You're too old to drive."
And the mother goes through a second red light.
And the daughter says, as tactfully as possible, "Mom, are you aware that you just went through two red lights?"
And the mother says, "Oh! Am I driving?"
And that's the shock of recognition at the shock of recognition.
That completes the quadruple.
I just want to say two more things.
One is, another characteristic of trickster is that the trickster has to walk this fine line.
He has to have poise.
And you know the biggest hurdle for me, in doing what I do, is constructing my performance so that it's prepared and unprepared.
Finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.
But being too prepared doesn't leave room for the accidents to happen.
I was thinking about what Moshe Safdie said yesterday about beauty because in his book, Hyde says that sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty.
But to do that you have to lose all the other qualities because once you're into beauty you're into a finished thing.
You're into something that occupies space and inhabits time.
It's an actual thing.
And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty.
But if you don't do that, if you allow for the accident to keep on happening, you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength.
I like to think of what I do as a probability wave.
When you go into beauty the probability wave collapses into one possibility.
And I like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience.
And the one final quality I want to say about trickster is that he doesn't have a home.
He's always on the road.
I want to say to you Richard, in closing, that in TED you've created a home.
And thank you for inviting me into it.
Thank you very much.

<title>Emily Levine: A theory of everything</title>
<description>Philosopher-comedian Emily Levine talks about science, math, society and the way everything connects. She's a brilliant trickster, poking holes in our fixed ideas and bringing hidden truths to light. Settle in and let her ping your brain.</description>
<keywords>cognitive science,comedy,entertainment,humor,philosophy,science,technology</keywords>

As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.
The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.
But the reality is far from it.
As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.
It is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old.
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.
It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling.
You can see on the left side a small boat.
That's about a 15-foot boat.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline.
You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.
It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is real time.
And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
Thank you.

If you'd like to learn how to play the lobster, we have some here.
And that's not a joke, we really do.
So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster.
So, actually, I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp a few years ago because they make sound.
This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp that's found off the coast of California.
And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound, it actually turns out to be a very difficult project.
And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp, or stomatopods, make sound, I started to think about their appendages.
And mantis shrimp are called "mantis shrimp" after the praying mantises, which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think, well, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds, to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes.
And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike, work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell.
So, mantis shrimp come in two varieties: there are spearers and smashers.
And this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod.
And he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead.
So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit, this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species -- recorded at 1,000 frames a second, played back at 15 frames per second.
And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs, exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it.
Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod, and these guys open up snails for a living.
And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.
So, I'll play it one more time.
He wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash.
And a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner.
So, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end, or it can smash with the heel.
And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike.
And so the first question that came to mind was, well, how fast does this limb move?
Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video.
And I immediately came upon a problem.
Every single high-speed video system in the biology department at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement.
We simply couldn't capture it on video.
And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time.
And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department, looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology.
And so we struck up a deal.
I said, "Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system that could capture these movements, you guys can film us collecting the data."
And believe it or not, they went for it.
So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light.
And low light is a critical issue with filming animals, because if it's too high, you fry them.
So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here, and there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel.
And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail.
And the snail's wired to a stick, so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And -- yeah.
I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here.
So this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second, and I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times.
And as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement.
The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards -- just a spectacular movement.
And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos, and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question.
And we were in for our first surprise.
So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second all the way up to 23 meters per second.
And for those of you who prefer miles per hour, that's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast.
In fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point on the extreme animal movement spectrum.
And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system. So our first surprise.
So that was really cool and very unexpected.
So, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it?
And actually, this work was done in the 1960s by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows.
And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what's called a "catch mechanism," or "click mechanism."
And what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract, and a latch that prevents anything from moving.
So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.
And once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up -- the latch flies upward, and you've got the movement.
And that's basically what's called a "power amplification system."
It takes a long time for the muscle to contract, and a very short time for the limb to fly out.
And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story.
This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes.
But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History.
And if any of you ever have a chance, backstage of the National Museum of Natural History is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what -- this is serious business for me.
So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb, whether it's a spearer or a smasher, is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here.
It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.
It's a very beautiful structure.
And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure.
And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while.
And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring.
There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe, and the speed that we observe, and the output of the system.
So we thought, OK, this must be a spring -- the saddle could very well be a spring.
And we went back to those high-speed videos again, and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending.
And I'll just do that one more time.
And then if you take a look at the video -- it's a little bit hard to see -- it's outlined in yellow.
The saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it extending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending.
So, we've had very solid evidence showing that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends, and does, in fact, function as a spring.
The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a "hyperbolic paraboloid surface," or an "anticlastic surface."
And this is very well known to engineers and architects, because it's a very strong surface in compression.
It has curves in two directions, one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other, so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface of this type of shape.
So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists.
It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry, because it requires very little material to build this type of surface, and it's very strong.
So if you're going to build a thin gold structure, it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong.
Now, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects is Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure.
And what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built that's 87 and a half feet spanwise.
It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points.
And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's -- he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points.
And all of these are the same principles that apply to the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods.
In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it.
So, very interesting parallels between the biological and the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out -- the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring.
That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting.
So the next and final question was, well, how much force does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails?
And so I wired up what's called a load cell.
A load cell measures forces, and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it.
And when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change and it -- which -- in proportion to the forces that go in.
So these animals are wonderfully aggressive, and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell, and they'd smash away at it.
And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell.
And we were able to get some force measurements out.
And again, we were in for a surprise.
I purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking, no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal.
And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell.
So these are actually some old data where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab, and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds generated by an animal about this big.
And actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell up and running, and I've clocked these animals generating well over 200 pounds of force.
And again, I think this will be a world record.
I have to do a little bit more background reading, but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given -- per body mass. So, really incredible forces.
And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system.
But that was not the end of the story.
Now, things -- I'm making this sound very easy, this is actually a lot of work.
And I got all these force measurements, and then I went and looked at the force output of the system.
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks.
And that was what really got me puzzled.
The first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell.
But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later, and I didn't know what that was.
So now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons, but not half a millisecond later.
Again, going back to those high-speed videos, there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on.
Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier.
There's that raptorial appendage -- there's the heel, and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell.
And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this, on the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through.
And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light.
Audience: Wow.
Sheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble.
And what that is, is cavitation.
And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds.
And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure, which results in the water literally vaporizing.
And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat, and it's a very destructive process.
And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon, because it destroys boat propellers.
People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it, just like these pictures show.
So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further, I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail.
This is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give full credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up, because I could never have done this in a million years -- one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen.
You can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light, and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail.
So really, just an amazing image, slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds.
And again, we can see it in slightly different form there, with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces.
In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb.
So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks: what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble.
And these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring, but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail.
So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals.
So, one question I often get after this talk -- so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?
Because obviously, if it's breaking snails, the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does.
That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images, and it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away their heel all the way to the flesh.
But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod is that you have to molt. And every three months or so these animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem.
Very, very convenient solution to that particular problem.
So, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note.
Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know.
So, the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring -- has actually been well known to biologists for a long time, not as a spring but as a visual signal.
And there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods.
And this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring.
And I think one explanation for this could be going back to the molting phenomenon.
So these animals go into a molting period where they're unable to strike -- their bodies become very soft.
And they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct.
This is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful, and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.
And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more, they just signal. They wave their legs around.
And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing.
It's a well-established fact of these animals that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to.
And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike, or their strike force, and something about the time period in the molting cycle.
So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring.
So to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators, Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this.
And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time, and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much.

I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land, from the great Central Valley of California to the bedrock of Manhattan, has really shaped our history and our character.
But one thing is clear.
In the last 100 years alone, our country -- and this is a sprawl map of America -- our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we've forgotten our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet.
And so, how I see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them.
This graph represents what we're dealing with now in the built environment.
And it's really a conflux of urban population rising, biodiversity plummeting and also, of course, sea levels rising and climate changing.
So when I also think about design, I think about trying to rework and re-engage the lines on this graph in a more productive way.
And you can see from the arrow here indicating "you are here," I'm trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology, and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way.
So the era of big infrastructure is over.
I mean, these sort of top-down, mono-functional, capital-intensive solutions are really not going to cut it.
We need new tools and new approaches.
Similarly, the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field, devoid of context, is really not the -- excuse me, it's fairly blatant -- is really not the approach that we need to take.
So we need new stories, new heroes and new tools.
So now I want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war, and that is the eastern oyster.
So, albeit a very small creature and very modest, this creature is incredible, because it can agglomerate into these mega-reef structures.
It can grow; you can grow it; and -- did I mention? -- it's quite tasty.
So the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called "oyster-tecture."
And the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels, eelgrass and oysters -- species that live in the harbor -- and, at the same time, harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now.
Here's a map of my city, New York City, showing inundation in red.
And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about, the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island.
If you look here at this map, showing everything in blue is out in the water, and everything in yellow is upland.
But you can see, even just intuit, from this map, that the harbor has dredged and flattened, and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years.
Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself.
Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly -- I will admit it.
There are problems of sewage overflow and contamination, but I would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition, and it's a condition that we're all facing.
And here's a map of that condition, showing the contaminants in yellow and green, exacerbated by this new flow of storm-surge and sea-level rise.
So we really had a lot to deal with.
When we started this project, one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there.
And you can see from this map, there's this incredible geographical signature of a series of islands that were out in the harbor and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches that served as natural wave attenuation for the upland settlement.
We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the Gowanus Canal itself.
So our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept, harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern.
And the idea has two core stages.
One is to develop a new artificial ecology, a reef out in the harbor, that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the Gowanus.
Because if you have cleaner water and slower water, you can imagine a new way of living with that water.
So the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way, I think.
Here we are, back to our hero, the oyster.
And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal.
It accepts algae and detritus in one end, and through this beautiful, glamorous set of stomach organs, out the other end comes cleaner water.
And one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day.
Oyster reefs also covered about a quarter of our harbor and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days.
They were key in our culture and our economy.
Basically, New York was built on the backs of oystermen, and our streets were literally built over oyster shells.
This image is an image of an oyster cart, which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today.
So again, we got the short end of the deal there.
Finally, oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures.
They really become nature's wave attenuators.
And they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem.
Many, many species depend on them.
So we were inspired by the oyster, but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster.
It can move from a fertilized egg to a spat, which is when they're floating through the water, and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster, to an adult male oyster or female oyster, in a number of weeks.
We reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the Gowanus as a giant oyster nursery where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus, then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef.
And so the core idea here was to hit the reset button and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive.
How does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple.
A core concept here is that climate change isn't something that -- the answers won't land down from the Moon.
And with a $20 billion price tag, we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what's in front of us.
So this image is simply showing -- it's a field of marine piles interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope.
What is fuzzy rope, you ask?
It's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing, available practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap.
So we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project.
So in the studio, rather than drawing, we began to learn how to knit.
The concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on.
You can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space.
And that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change.
It also creates this incredibly interesting, I think, new amphibious public space, where you can imagine working, you can imagine recreating in a new way.
In the end, what we realized we were making was a new blue-green watery park for the next watery century -- an amphibious park, if you will.
So get your Tevas on.
So you can imagine scuba diving here.
This is an image of high school students, scuba divers that we worked with on our team.
So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water, and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in terms of monitoring.
Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world: this is the word "flupsy" -- it's short for "floating upwelling system."
And this glorious, readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below.
So the water is churned through this raft.
You can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them.
So rather than having 10 oysters, you have 10,000 oysters.
And then those spat are then seeded.
Here's the Gowanus future with the oyster rafts on the shorelines -- the flupsification of the Gowanus.
New word.
And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges.
And finally, how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef.
I get asked two questions about this project.
One is: why isn't it happening now?
And the second one is: when can we eat the oysters?
And the answer is: not yet, they're working.
But we imagine, with our calculations, that by 2050, you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster.
To conclude, this is just one cross-section of one piece of city, but my dream is, my hope is, that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable, a more livable and a more delicious future.
Thank you.

Three years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.
My Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation, was going berserk, and the closer I got, the more frenetic it became, and frantic. My God.
I was there covering the 25th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident, as you can see by the look on my face, reluctantly so, but with good reason, because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and the sarcophagus, which is the covering over reactor number four, which was hastily built 27 years ago, now sits cracked and rusted and leaking radiation.
So I was filming.
I just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast.
But then, I looked into the distance, and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse, and I'm thinking, who could be living here?
I mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air, are among the most highly contaminated on Earth, and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone, and it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards.
You have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away, you have to have a government minder, and there's draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring.
The point being, no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone.
But they are.
It turns out an unlikely community of some 200 people are living inside the zone.
They're called self-settlers.
And almost all of them are women, the men having shorter lifespans in part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes, if not radiation.
Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident, but not everybody accepted that fate.
The women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s, are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and, it would seem, common sense, and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone.
They did so illegally.
As one woman put it to a soldier who was trying to evacuate her for a second time, "Shoot me and dig the grave.
Otherwise, I'm going home."
Now why would they return to such deadly soil?
I mean, were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them, or both?
The thing is, they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently.
Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages, eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic, totally contaminated.
Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident, but a few are left like this, kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy.
Others have a few residents in them, one or two "babushkas," or "babas," which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother.
Another village might have six or seven residents.
So this is the strange demographic of the zone -- isolated alone together.
And when I made my way to that piping chimney I'd seen in the distance, I saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her.
She's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village, population eight.
And she said to me, when I asked her the obvious, "Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does."
And you have to remember, these women have survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century.
Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor, killed millions of Ukrainians, and they faced the Nazis in the '40s, who came through slashing, burning, raping, and in fact many of these women were shipped to Germany as forced labor.
So when a couple decades into Soviet rule, Chernobyl happened, they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible.
So they returned to their villages and are told they're going to get sick and die soon, but five happy years, their logic goes, is better than 10 stuck in a high rise on the outskirts of Kiev, separated from the graves of their mothers and fathers and babies, the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon.
For them, environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation.
It turns out this holds true for other species as well.
Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned to the region in force, the very real, very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans.
The dead zone, it turns out, is full of life.
And there is a kind of heroic resilience, a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at 5 a.m.
pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes, their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka.
And there's a patina of simple defiance among them.
"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?"
I mean, what about their health?
The benefits of hardy, physical living, but an environment made toxic by a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation.
It's incredibly difficult to parse.
Health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught.
The World Health Organization puts the number of Chernobyl-related deaths at 4,000, eventually.
Greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands.
Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere: higher levels of anxiety, depression, alcoholism, unemployment and, importantly, disrupted social networks.
Now, like many of you, I have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life.
Home is a transient concept.
I have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil.
So it's hard for us to understand, but home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka, and connection to the land is palpable.
And perhaps because these Ukrainian women were schooled under the Soviets and versed in the Russian poets, aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time.
"If you leave, you die."
"Those who left are worse off now.
They are dying of sadness."
"Motherland is motherland. I will never leave."
What sounds like faith, soft faith, may actually be fact, because the surprising truth -- I mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on Earth for the last 27 years, have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation, by some estimates up to 10 years.
How could this be?
Here's a theory: Could it be that those ties to ancestral soil, the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms, actually affect longevity?
The power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative.
Home and community are forces that rival even radiation.
Now radiation or not, these women are at the end of their lives.
In the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone, and it will revert to a wild, radioactive place, full only of animals and occasionally daring, flummoxed scientists.
But the spirit and existence of the babushkas, whose numbers have been halved in the three years I've known them, will leave us with powerful new templates to think about and grapple with, about the relative nature of risk, about transformative connections to home, and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self-determination.
Thank you.

So today I'm going to talk to you about the rise of collaborative consumption.
I'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you -- in just 15 minutes -- that this isn't a flimsy idea, or a short-term trend, but a powerful cultural and economic force reinventing not just what we consume, but how we consume.
Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example.
Hands up -- how many of you have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos lying around your house that you probably won't use again, but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away?
Can't see all the hands, but it looks like all of you, right?
On our shelves at home, we have a box set of the DVD series "24," season six to be precise.
I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present.
Now my husband, Chris, and I love this show.
But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice, you don't really want to watch it again, because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists.
So there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us, but with immediate latent value to someone else.
Now before we go on, I have a confession to make.
I lived in New York for 10 years, and I am a big fan of "Sex and the City."
Now I'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week.
So how easily could I swap our unwanted copy of "24" for a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?"
Now you may have noticed there's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.
Now the easiest analogy for swap-trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media.
What it does is use the Internet to create an infinite marketplace to match person A's "haves" with person C's "wants," whatever they may be.
The other week, I went on one of these sites, appropriately called Swaptree, and there were over 59,300 items that I could instantly swap for my copy of "24."
Lo and behold, there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron who wanted swap his or her "like new" copy of "Sex and the City" for my copy of "24."
So in other words, what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem, a problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants," in approximately 60 seconds.
What's even more amazing is it will print out a purchase label on the spot, because it knows the weight of the item.
Now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as Swaptree, but that's not my interest, and nor is swap trading, per se.
My passion, and what I've spent the last few years dedicated to researching, is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics inherent in these systems.
When you think about it, it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago, that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger whose real name I didn't know and without any money changing hands.
Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree happen successfully, and the one percent that receive a negative rating, it's for relatively minor reasons, like the item didn't arrive on time.
So what's happening here?
An extremely powerful dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural implications is at play.
Namely, that technology is enabling trust between strangers.
We now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face, but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before.
So what's actually happening is that social networks and real-time technologies are taking us back.
We're bartering, trading, swapping, sharing, but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms.
What I find fascinating is that we've actually wired our world to share, whether that's our neighborhood, our school, our office, or our Facebook network, and that's creating an economy of "what's mine is yours."
From the mighty eBay, the grandfather of exchange marketplaces, to car-sharing companies such as GoGet, where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour, to social lending platforms such as Zopa, that will take anyone in this audience with 100 dollars to lend, and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world, we're sharing and collaborating again in ways that I believe are more hip than hippie.
I call this "groundswell collaborative consumption."
Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption, I'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked, which is, where did this idea come from?
Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning and said, "I'm going to write about collaborative consumption," but actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas.
Over the next minute, you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head.
The first thing I began to notice: how many big concepts were emerging -- from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs -- around how ridiculously easy it is to form groups for a purpose.
And linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world -- from the election of a president to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between -- on what the power of numbers could achieve.
Now, you know when you learn a new word, and then you start to see that word everywhere?
That's what happened to me when I noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators, to highly enabled collaborators.
What's happening is the Internet is removing the middleman, so that anyone from a T-shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer-to-peer.
And the ubiquitous force of this peer-to-peer revolution means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.
I mean, it's amazing to think that, in every single minute of this speech, 25 hours of YouTube video will be loaded.
Now what I find fascinating about these examples is how they're actually tapping into our primate instincts.
I mean, we're monkeys, and we're born and bred to share and cooperate.
And we were doing so for thousands of years, whether it's when we hunted in packs, or farmed in cooperatives, before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms.
But things are changing, and one of the reasons why is the digital natives, or Gen-Y.
They're growing up sharing -- files, video games, knowledge.
It's second nature to them.
So we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial -- are like foot soldiers, moving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we."
The reason why it's happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration.
We now live in a connected age where we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time, from a small device in our hands.
All of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008, when, of course, the great financial crash happened.
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists, and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall, when Mother Nature and the market both said, "No more."
Now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper-consumption is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.
Yet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.
So all of this is a lot of twittering, right?
Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head, until actually I realized it was happening because of four key drivers.
One, a renewed belief in the importance of community, and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.
A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks and real-time technologies, fundamentally changing the way we behave.
Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.
And four, a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors.
These four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century, defined by hyper-consumption, towards the 21st century, defined by collaborative consumption.
I generally believe we're at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors -- through sites such as Flickr and Twitter that are becoming second nature online -- are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives.
From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food, we are consuming and collaborating once again.
So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption.
And although they vary enormously in scale, maturity and purpose, when we dived into them, we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.
The first is redistribution markets.
Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree, are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere, or someone, where it is.
They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' -- reduce, reuse, recycle, repair and redistribute -- because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste.
The second is collaborative lifestyles.
This is the sharing of resources of things like money, skills and time.
I bet, in a couple of years, that phrases like "coworking" and "couchsurfing" and "time banks" are going to become a part of everyday vernacular.
One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called Landshare.
It's a scheme in the U.K.
that matches Mr. Jones, with some spare space in his back garden, with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.
Together they grow their own food.
It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant, you wonder why it's never been done before.
Now, the third system is product-service systems.
This is where you pay for the benefit of the product -- what it does for you -- without needing to own the product outright.
This idea is particularly powerful for things that have high-idling capacity.
And that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to -- how many of you have a power drill, own a power drill? Right.
That power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes in its entire lifetime.
It's kind of ridiculous, right?
Because what you need is the hole, not the drill.
So why don't you rent the drill, or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it?
These three systems are coming together, allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles, or their cherished personal freedoms.
I'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit.
So I want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors.
The average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run.
Yet, that car sits idle for 23 hours a day.
So when you consider these two facts, it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright.
So this is where car-sharing companies such as Zipcar and GoGet come in.
In 2009, Zipcar took 250 participants from across 13 cities -- and they're all self-confessed car addicts and car-sharing rookies -- and got them to surrender their keys for a month.
Instead, these people had to walk, bike, take the train, or other forms of public transport.
They could only use their Zipcar membership when absolutely necessary.
The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering.
It's amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise.
But my favorite statistic is that 100 out of the 250 participants did not want their keys back.
In other words, the car addicts had lost their urge to own.
Now products-service systems have been around for years.
Just think of libraries and laundrettes.
But I think they're entering a new age, because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun.
There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times that said, "Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the 8-track, what solar power is to the coal mine."
I believe also, our generation, our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation.
I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.
I don't want a clunky answering machine; I want the message it saves.
I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.
In other words, I don't want stuff; I want the needs or experiences it fulfills.
This is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions -- or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it, "where access is better than ownership."
Now as our possessions dematerialize into the cloud, a blurry line is appearing between what's mine, what's yours, and what's ours.
I want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening.
This represents an eight-year time span.
We've gone from traditional car-ownership to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet, to ride-sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental, where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day to your neighbor.
Now all of these systems require a degree of trust, and the cornerstone to this working is reputation.
Now in the old consumer system, our reputation didn't matter so much, because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer-to-peer review.
But now with the Web, we leave a trail.
With every spammer we flag, with every idea we post, comment we share, we're actually signaling how well we collaborate, and whether we can or can't be trusted.
Let's go back to my first example, Swaptree.
I can see that Rondoron has completed 553 trades with a 100 percent success rate.
In other words, I can trust him or her.
Now mark my words, it's only a matter of time before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital.
And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption.
It's a new social currency, so to speak, that could become as powerful as our credit rating.
Now as a closing thought, I believe we're actually in a period where we're waking up from this humongous hangover of emptiness and waste, and we're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual identity.
I believe it will be referred to as a revolution, so to speak -- when society, faced with great challenges, made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good.
I'm on a mission to make sharing cool.
I'm on a mission to make sharing hip.
Because I really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business, help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption and teach us when enough really is enough.
Thank you very much.

I woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion.
It was deep at night.
I do not remember what time it was.
I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking.
Everything in my room was shaking -- my heart, my windows, my bed, everything.
I looked out the windows and I saw a full half-circle of explosion.
I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray, and a full circle of explosion.
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared.
I went back to my bed, and I prayed, and I secretly thanked God that that missile did not land on my family's home, that it did not kill my family that night.
Thirty years have passed, and I still feel guilty about that prayer, for the next day, I learned that that missile landed on my brother's friend's home and killed him and his father, but did not kill his mother or his sister.
His mother showed up the next week at my brother's classroom and begged seven-year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son, for she had lost everything.
This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war, and nameless refugees, whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes, dirty face, scared eyes.
This is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war, who we do not know their hopes, their dreams, their accomplishments, their families, their beliefs, their values.
This is my story.
I was that girl.
I am another image and vision of another survivor of war.
I am that refugee, and I am that girl.
You see, I grew up in war-torn Iraq, and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it.
We only talk about one side of it.
But there's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it.
I grew up with the colors of war -- the red colors of fire and blood, the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile, so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it.
I grew up with the sounds of war -- the staccato sounds of gunfire, the wrenching booms of explosions, ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens.
These are the sounds you would expect, but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night, the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous, unbearable silence.
"War," a friend of mine said, "is not about sound at all.
It is actually about silence, the silence of humanity."
I have since left Iraq and founded a group called Women for Women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars.
In my travels and in my work, from Congo to Afghanistan, from Sudan to Rwanda, I have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same, but the fears of war are the same.
You know, there is a fear of dying, and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid.
It is very scary to go through that feeling of "I am about to die" or "I could die in this explosion."
But there's also the fear of losing loved ones, and I think that's even worse.
It's too painful. You don't want to think about it.
But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear -- as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me, who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo; she said, "The fear of losing the 'I' in me, the fear of losing the 'I' in me."
That's what my mother in Iraq used to tell me.
It's like dying from inside-out.
A Palestinian woman once told me, "It is not about the fear of one death," she said, "sometimes I feel I die 10 times in one day," as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets.
She said, "But it's not fair, because there is only one life, and there should only be one death."
We have been only seeing one side of war.
We have only been discussing and consumed with high-level preoccupations over troop levels, drawdown timelines, surges and sting operations, when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn, where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going.
We have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics, tactics, weapons, dollars and casualties.
This is the language of sterility.
How casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic.
This is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities.
Eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children. Oh.
Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians.
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children.
How interesting.
Oh, half a million women in Rwanda get raped in 100 days.
Or, as we speak now, hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated.
How interesting.
These just become numbers that we refer to.
The front of wars is increasingly non-human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space, guiding missiles toward unseen targets, while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attack hits a villager instead of an extremist.
It is a chess game.
You learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership.
Checkmate.
We are missing a completely other side of wars.
We are missing my mother's story, who made sure with every siren, with every raid, with every cut off-of electricity, she played puppet shows for my brothers and I, so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions.
We are missing the story of Fareeda, a music teacher, a piano teacher, in Sarajevo, who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo and walked to that school, despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her, and kept the piano, the violin, the cello playing the whole duration of the war, with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats.
That was her fight.
That was her resistance.
We are missing the story of Nehia, a Palestinian woman in Gaza who, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war, she left out of home, collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have, in case there is no cease-fire the day after.
We are missing the stories of Violet, who, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre, she kept on going on, burying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets.
We are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars.
Do you know -- do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going?
And the ones who are keeping that life are women.
There are two sides of war.
There is a side that fights, and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open.
There is a side that is focused on winning battles, and there is a side that is focused on winning life.
There is a side that leads the front-line discussion, and there is a side that leads the back-line discussion.
There is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting, and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs.
There is a side that is led by men, and there is a side that is led by women.
And in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace, we must understand war and peace from both sides.
We must have a full picture of what that means.
In order for us to understand what actually peace means, we need to understand, as one Sudanese woman once told me, "Peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again."
She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan, for 20 years of war, where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees.
Many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers, as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers.
So that woman walked for 20 years, so she would not be kidnapped again.
And only when there was some sort of peace, her toenails grew back again.
We need to understand peace from a toenail's perspective.
We need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table.
I find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping, and the group of people who are mostly -- though not exclusively -- who are keeping life going in the midst of war, are not included in the negotiating table.
And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion, but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion.
The doctors who are not fighting, the artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns, they are, too, excluded from the negotiating tables.
There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace, building of democracy, sustainable economies, any kind of stabilities, if we do not fully include women at the negotiating table.
Not one, but 50 percent.
There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls.
Did you know that one year of the world's military spending equals 700 years of the U.N. budget and equals 2,928 years of the U.N. budget allocated for women?
If we just reverse that distribution of funds, perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world.
And last, but not least, we need to invest in peace and women, not only because it is the right thing to do, not only because it is the right thing to do, for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today, but it is for the future.
A Congolese woman, who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them, and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them, how they're doing okay right now.
She got into Women for Women International's program.
She got a support network.
She learned about her rights.
We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job.
She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay.
She was sending them to school. Have a new home.
She said, "But what I worry about the most is not any of that.
I worry that my children have hate in their hearts, and when they want to grow up, they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother."
We need to invest in women, because that's our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future.
That mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do.
Are there good news? Of course, there are good news. There are lots of good news.
To start with, these women that I told you about are dancing and singing every single day, and if they can, who are we not to dance?
That girl that I told you about ended up starting Women for Women International Group that impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars, and I started this from zero, nothing, nada, [unclear].
They are women who are standing on their feet in spite of their circumstances, not because of it.
Think of how the world can be a much better place if, for a change, we have a better equality, we have equality, we have a representation and we understand war, both from the front-line and the back-line discussion.
Rumi, a 13th-century Sufi poet, says, "Out beyond the worlds of right-doings and wrong-doings, there is a field.
I will meet you there.
When the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about.
Ideas, language, even the phrase 'each other' no longer makes any sense."
I humbly add -- humbly add -- that out beyond the worlds of war and peace, there is a field, and there are many women and men [who] are meeting there.
Let us make this field a much bigger place.
Let us all meet in that field.
Thank you.

<title>Zainab Salbi: Women, wartime and the dream of peace</title>
<description>In war we often see only the frontline stories of soldiers and combat. AT TEDGlobal 2010, Zainab Salbi tells powerful "backline" stories of women who keep everyday life going during conflicts, and calls for women to have a place at the negotiating table once fighting is over.</description>
<keywords>drones,global issues,iraq,politics,war,women</keywords>

What I want to do today is to spend some time talking about some stuff that's sort of giving me a little bit of existential angst, for lack of a better word, over the past couple of years, and basically, these three quotes tell what's going on.
"When God made the color purple, God was just showing off," Alice Walker wrote in "The Color Purple," and Zora Neale Hurston wrote in "Dust Tracks On A Road," "Research is a formalized curiosity.
It's poking and prying with a purpose."
And then finally, when I think about the near future, you know, we have this attitude, well, whatever happens, happens. Right?
So that goes along with the Chesire Cat saying, "If you don't care much where you want to get to, it doesn't much matter which way you go."
But I think it does matter which way we go, and what road we take, because when I think about design in the near future, what I think are the most important issues, what's really crucial and vital is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now in 2002.
If we describe the near future as 10, 20, 15 years from now, that means that what we do today is going to be critically important, because in the year 2015, and the year 2020, 2025, the world our society is going to be building on, the basic knowledge and abstract ideas, the discoveries that we came up with today, just as all these wonderful things we're hearing about here at the TED conference that we take for granted in the world right now, were really knowledge and ideas that came up in the '50s, the '60s, and the '70s.
That's the substrate that we're exploiting today, whether it's the internet, genetic engineering, laser scanners, guided missiles, fiber optics, high-definition television, sensing, remote-sensing from space and the wonderful remote-sensing photos that we see in 3D weaving, TV programs like Tracker, and Enterprise, CD rewrite drives, flatscreen, Alvin Ailey's Suite Otis, or Sarah Jones' "Your Revolution Will Not Be Between These Thighs," which by the way was banned by the FCC, or ska, all of these things without question, almost without exception, are really based on ideas and abstract and creativity from years before, so we have to ask ourselves, what are we contributing to that legacy right now? And when I think about it, I'm really worried. To be quite frank, I'm concerned. I'm skeptical that we're doing very much of anything.
We're, in a sense, failing to act in the future. We're purposefully, consciously being laggards.
We're lagging behind.
Frantz Fanon, who was a psychiatrist from Martinique, said, "Each generation must, out of relative obscurity, discover its mission, and fulfill or betray it."
What is our mission? What do we have to do? I think our mission is to reconcile, to reintegrate science and the arts, because right now there's a schism that exists in popular culture. You know, people have this idea that science and the arts are really separate.
We think of them as separate and different things, and this idea was probably introduced centuries ago, but it's really becoming critical now, because we're making decisions about our society every day that, if we keep thinking that the arts are separate from the sciences, and we keep thinking it's cute to say, "I don't understand anything about this one, I don't understand anything about the other one," then we're going to have problems.
Now I know no one here at TED thinks this. All of us, we already know that they're very connected, but I'm going to let you know that some folks in the outside world, believe it or not, they think it's neat when they say, "You know, scientists and science is not creative. Maybe scientists are ingenious, but they're not creative.
And then we have this tendency, the career counselors and various people say things like, "Artists are not analytical.
They're ingenious, perhaps, but not analytical," and when these concepts underly our teaching and what we think about the world, then we have a problem, because we stymie support for everything.
By accepting this dichotomy, whether it's tongue-in-cheek, when we attempt to accommodate it in our world, and we try to build our foundation for the world, we're messing up the future, because, who wants to be uncreative?
Who wants to be illogical?
Talent would run from either of these fields if you said you had to choose either.
Then they're going to go to something where they think, "Well, I can be creative and logical at the same time."
Now I grew up in the '60s and I'll admit it, actually, my childhood spanned the '60s, and I was a wannabe hippie and I always resented the fact that I wasn't really old enough to be a hippie.
And I know there are people here, the younger generation who want to be hippies, but people talk about the '60s all the time, and they talk about the anarchy that was there, but when I think about the '60s, what I took away from it was that there was hope for the future.
We thought everyone could participate.
There were wonderful, incredible ideas that were always percolating, and so much of what's cool or hot today is really based on some of those concepts, whether it's, you know, people trying to use the prime directive from Star Trek being involved in things, or again that three-dimensional weaving and fax machines that I read about in my weekly readers that the technology and engineering was just getting started.
But the '60s left me with a problem.
You see, I always assumed I would go into space, because I followed all of this, but I also loved the arts and sciences.
You see, when I was growing up as a little girl and as a teenager, I loved designing and making dogs' clothes and wanting to be a fashion designer.
I took art and ceramics. I loved dance.
Lola Falana. Alvin Ailey. Jerome Robbins.
And I also avidly followed the Gemini and the Apollo programs.
I had science projects and tons of astronomy books. I took calculus and philosophy.
I wondered about the infinity and the Big Bang theory.
And when I was at Stanford, I found myself, my senior year, chemical engineering major, half the folks thought I was a political science and performing arts major, which was sort of true because I was Black Student Union President and I did major in some other things, and I found myself the last quarter juggling chemical engineering separation processes, logic classes, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and also producing and choreographing a dance production, and I had to do the lighting and the design work, and I was trying to figure out, do I go to New York City to try to become a professional dancer, or do I go to medical school?
Now, my mother helped me figure that one out.
But when I went into space, when I went into space I carried a number of things up with me. I carried a poster by Alvin Ailey, which you can figure out now, I love the dance company.
An Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison performing the dance "Cry," dedicated to all black women everywhere. A Bundu statue, which was from the Women's Society in Sierra Leone, and a certificate for the Chicago Public School students to work to improve their science and math, and folks asked me, "Why did you take up what you took up?"
And I had to say, "Because it represents human creativity, the creativity that allowed us, that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch the space shuttle, springs from the same source as the imagination and analysis it took to carve a Bundu statue, or the ingenuity it took to design, choreograph, and stage "Cry."
Each one of them are different manifestations, incarnations, of creativity, avatars of human creativity, and that's what we have to reconcile in our minds, how these things fit together.
The difference between arts and sciences is not analytical versus intuitive, right?
E=MC squared required an intuitive leap, and then you had to do the analysis afterwards.
Einstein said, in fact, "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious.
It is the source of all true art and science."
Dance requires us to express and want to express the jubilation in life, but then you have to figure out, exactly what movement do I do to make sure that it comes across correctly?
The difference between arts and sciences is also not constructive versus deconstructive, right? A lot of people think of the sciences as deconstructive.
You have to pull things apart.
And yeah, sub-atomic physics is deconstructive. You literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them. But sculpture, from what I understand from great sculptors, is deconstructive, because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there.
Biotechnology is constructive.
Orchestral arranging is constructive.
So in fact we use constructive and deconstructive techniques in everything.
The difference between science and the arts is not that they are different sides of the same coin, even, or even different parts of the same continuum, but rather they're manifestations of the same thing.
Different quantum states of an atom?
Or maybe if I want to be more 21st century I could say that they are different harmonic resonances of a superstring.
But we'll leave that alone.
They spring from the same source.
The arts and sciences are avatars of human creativity. It's our attempt as humans to build an understanding of the universe, the world around us.
It's our attempt to influence things, the universe internal to ourselves and external to us.
The sciences, to me, are manifestations of our attempt to express or share our understanding, our experience, to influence the universe external to ourselves.
It doesn't rely on us as individuals.
It's the universe, as experienced by everyone, and the arts manifest our desire, our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals.
Let me say it again another way: science provides an understanding of a universal experience, and arts provides a universal understanding of a personal experience.
That's what we have to think about, that they're all part of us, they're all part of a continuum.
It's not just the tools, it's not just the sciences, you know, the mathematics and the numerical stuff and the statistics, because we heard, very much on this stage, people talked about music being mathematical. Right? Arts don't just use clay, aren't the only ones that use clay, light and sound and movement.
They use analysis as well.
So people might say, well, I still like that intuitive versus analytical thing, because everybody wants to do the right brain, left brain thing, right?
We've all been accused of being right-brained or left-brained at some point in time, depending on who we disagreed with.
You know, people say intuitive, you know that's like you're in touch with nature, in touch with yourself and relationships.
Analytical: you put your mind to work, and I'm going to tell you a little secret. You all know this though, but sometimes people use this analysis idea, that things are outside of ourselves, to be, say, that this is what we're going to elevate as the true, most important sciences, right?
And then you have artists, and you all know this is true as well, artists will say things about scientists because they say they're too concrete, they're disconnected with the world.
But, we've even had that here on stage, so don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.
We had folks talking about the Flat Earth Society and flower arrangers, so there's this whole dichotomy that we continue to carry along, even when we know better.
And folks say we need to choose either or.
But it would really be foolish to choose either one, right?
Intuitive versus analytical?
That's a foolish choice. It's foolish, just like trying to choose between being realistic or idealistic.
You need both in life. Why do people do this? I'm just gonna quote a molecular biologist, Sydney Brenner, who's 70 years old so he can say this. He said, "It's always important to distinguish between chastity and impotence."
Now...
I want to share with you a little equation, okay?
How do understanding science and the arts fit into our lives and what's going on and the things that we're talking about here at the design conference, and this is a little thing I came up with, understanding and our resources and our will cause us to have outcomes.
Our understanding is our science, our arts, our religion, how we see the universe around us, our resources, our money, our labor, our minerals, those things that are out there in the world we have to work with.
But more importantly, there's our will.
This is our vision, our aspirations of the future, our hopes, our dreams, our struggles and our fears.
Our successes and our failures influence what we do with all of those, and to me, design and engineering, craftsmanship and skilled labor, are all the things that work on this to have our outcome, which is our human quality of life.
Where do we want the world to be?
And guess what?
Regardless of how we look at this, whether we look at arts and sciences are separate or different, they're both being influenced now and they're both having problems.
I did a project called S.E.E.ing the Future: Science, Engineering and Education, and it was looking at how to shed light on most effective use of government funding.
We got a bunch of scientists in all stages of their careers. They came to Dartmouth College, where I was teaching, and they talked about with theologians and financiers, what are some of the issues of public funding for science and engineering research? What's most important about it?
There are some ideas that emerged that I think have really powerful parallels to the arts. The first thing they said was that the circumstances that we find ourselves in today in the sciences and engineering that made us world leaders is very different than the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s and the '70s when we emerged as world leaders, because we're no longer in competition with fascism, with Soviet-style communism, and by the way that competition wasn't just military, it included social competition and political competition as well, that allowed us to look at space as one of those platforms to prove that our social system was better.
Another thing they talked about was the infrastructure that supports the sciences is becoming obsolete. We look at universities and colleges, small, mid-sized community colleges across the country, their laboratories are becoming obsolete, and this is where we train most of our science workers and our researchers, and our teachers, by the way, and then that there's a media that doesn't support the dissemination of any more than the most mundane and inane of information.
There's pseudo-science, crop circles, alien autopsy, haunted houses, or disasters. And that's what we see.
And this isn't really the information you need to operate in everyday life and figure out how to participate in this democracy and determine what's going on.
They also said that there's a change in the corporate mentality. Whereas government money had always been there for basic science and engineering research, we also counted on some companies to do some basic research, but what's happened now is companies put more energy into short-term product development than they do in basic engineering and science research.
And education is not keeping up.
In K through 12, people are taking out wet labs. They think if we put a computer in the room it's going to take the place of actually, we're mixing the acids, we're growing the potatoes.
And government funding is decreasing in spending and then they're saying, let's have corporations take over, and that's not true. Government funding should at least do things like recognize cost-benefits of basic science and engineering research. We have to know that we have a responsibility as global citizens in this world.
We have to look at the education of humans. We need to build our resources today to make sure that they're trained so that they understand the importance of these things, and we have to support the vitality of science, and that doesn't mean that everything has to have one thing that's going to go on, or we know exactly what's going to be the outcome of it, but that we support the vitality and the intellectual curiosity that goes along, and if you think about those parallels to the arts, the competition with the Bolshoi Ballet spurred the Joffrey and the New York City Ballet to become better.
Infrastructure museums, theaters, movie houses across the country are disappearing. We have more television stations with less to watch, we have more money spent on rewrites to get old television programs in the movies.
We have corporate funding now that, when it goes to some company, when it goes to support the arts, it almost requires that the product be part of the picture that the artist draws, and we have stadiums that are named over and over again by corporations.
In Houston, we're trying to figure out what to do with that Enron Stadium thing.
And fine arts and education in the schools is disappearing, and we have a government that seems like it's gutting the NEA and other programs, so we have to really stop and think, what are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts?
There's a need to revitalize them.
We have to pay attention to it. I just want to tell you really quickly what I'm doing.
I want to tell you what I've been doing a little bit since... I feel this need to sort of integrate some of the ideas that I've had and run across over time.
One of the things that I found out is that there's a need to repair the dichotomy between the mind and body as well. My mother always told me, you have to be observant, know what's going on in your mind and your body, and as a dancer I had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body, just as I knew how to sense colors.
Then I went to medical school, and I was supposed to just go on what the machine said about bodies.
You know, you would ask patients questions and some people would tell you, "Don't, don't, don't listen to what the patients said." We know that patients know and understand their bodies better, but these days we're trying to divorce them from that idea. We have to reconcile the patient's knowledge of their body with physician's measurements.
We had someone talk about measuring emotions and getting machines to figure out what, to keep us from acting crazy. Right?
No, we shouldn't measure, we shouldn't use machines to measure road rage and then do something to keep us from engaging in it.
Maybe we can have machines help us to recognize that we have road rage and then we need to know how to control that without the machines. We even need to be able to recognize that without the machines.
What I'm very concerned about is how do we bolster our self-awareness as humans, as biological organisms?
Michael Moschen spoke of having to teach and learn how to feel with my eyes, to see with my hands.
We have all kinds of possibilities to use our senses by, and that's what we have to do.
That's what I want to do, is to try to use bioinstrumentation, those kind of things to help our senses in what we do, and that's the work I've been doing now as a company called BioSentient Corporation.
I figured I'd have to do that ad, because I'm an entrepreneur, because entrepreneur says that that's somebody who does what they want to do because they're not broke enough that they have to get a real job.
But that's the work I'm doing with BioSentient Corporation trying to figure out how do we integrate these things?
Let me finish by saying that my personal design issue for the future is really about integrating, to think about that intuitive and that analytical.
The arts and sciences are not separate.
High school physics lesson before you leave. High school physics teacher used to hold up a ball. She would say this ball has potential energy, but nothing will happen to it, it can't do any work until I drop it and it changes states.
I like to think of ideas as potential energy.
They're really wonderful, but nothing will happen until we risk putting them into action.
This conference is filled with wonderful ideas.
We're going to share lots of things with people, but nothing's going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action.
We need to revitalize the arts and sciences of today, we need to take responsibility for the future. We can't hide behind saying it's just for company profits, or it's just a business, or I'm an artist or an academician.
Here's how you judge what you're doing.
I talked about that balance between intuitive, analytical.
Fran Lebowitz, my favorite cynic, she said the three questions of greatest concern, now I'm going to add on to design, is, "Is it attractive?"
That's the intuitive.
"Is it amusing?" The analytical.
"And does it know its place?"
The balance. Thank you very much.

<title>Mae Jemison: Teach arts and sciences together</title>
<description>Mae Jemison is an astronaut, a doctor, an art collector, a dancer ... Telling stories from her own education and from her time in space, she calls on educators to teach both the arts and sciences, both intuition and logic, as one -- to create bold thinkers.</description>
<keywords>art,arts,dance,education,future,science,space,technology</keywords>

I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design; I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art.
But what we're going to talk about today is really design. Really good designers are like sponges: they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way, and transform it so that it can be used by people like us.
And so that gives me an opportunity, because every design show that I curate kind of looks at a different world. And it's great, because it seems like every time I change jobs.
And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview of the next exhibition that I'm working on, which is called "Design and the Elastic Mind."
The world that I decided to focus on this particular time is the world of science and the world of technology.
Technology always comes into play when design is involved, but science does a little less.
But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them.
And this is what this exhibition looks at.
If you think about your life today, you go every day through many different scales, many different changes of rhythm and pace.
You work over different time zones, you talk to very different people, you multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically.
Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic, others are a little slower, others have a few stretch marks, but nonetheless this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint.
Other people are not as elastic.
I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet.
He doesn't want to put high-speed Internet at home.
And that's because there's some little bit of fear, little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms.
So designers work on this particular malaise that we have, these kinds of discomforts that we have, and try to make life easier for us.
Elasticity of mind is something that we really need, you know, we really need, we really cherish and we really work on.
And this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic, and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity. And one last thing is that it's not only designers, but it's also scientists.
And before I launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview, I would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design.
You can say that the relationship between science and design goes back centuries. You can of course talk about Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women -- and there's a gigantic history behind it.
But according to a really great science historian you might know, Peter Galison -- he teaches at Harvard -- what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed interest, this real passion for design.
So basically, the idea of being able to build things bottom up, atom by atom, has made them all into tinkerers.
And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers, just like designers are seeking scientists.
It's a brand-new love affair that we're trying to cultivate at MOMA. Together with Adam Bly, who is the founder of Seed magazine -- that's now a multimedia company, you might know it -- we founded about a year ago a monthly salon for designers and scientists, and it's quite beautiful.
And Keith has come, and also Jonathan has come and many others.
And it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know, scientists would tell designers, you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant.
And designers would like, oh, I don't know how to do an equation, I don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden they really started talking each others' language, and now we're already at the point that they collaborate.
Paul Steinhardt, a physicist from New York, and Aranda/Lasch, architects, collaborated in an installation in London at the Serpentine.
And it's really interesting to see how this happens.
The exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists, and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us.
I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now, just to give you a taste of it.
Nanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance, have really opened the designer's mind.
In this case I'm showing more the designers' work, because they're the ones that have really been stimulated.
A lot of the objects in the show are concepts, not objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here is the work of some scientists from UCLA.
This kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins -- not only by color but literally by alphabet letters.
So they construct it, and they can construct all kinds of forms at the nanoscale. This is the work of design students from the Royal College of Arts in London that have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne, and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future.
New sensing elements on the body -- you can grow hairs on your nails, and therefore grab some of the particles from another person.
They seem very, very obsessed with finding out more about the ideal mate.
So they're working on enhancing everything: touch, smell -- everything they can, in order to find the perfect mate.
Very interesting. This is a typeface designer from Israel who has designed -- he calls them "typosperma."
He's thinking -- of course it's all a concept -- of injecting typefaces into spermatozoa, I don't know how to say it in English -- spermatazoi -- in order to make them become -- to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ejaculation.
I tell you, designers are quite fantastic, you know.
So, tissue design.
In this case too, you have a mixture of scientists and designers.
This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts.
The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint.
One of the assignments for a year was to work with in-vitro meat.
You know that already you can grow meat in vitro.
In Australia they did it -- this research company, called SymbioticA.
But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty.
And so, the assignment to the students was, how should the steak of tomorrow be?
When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape, what should it be like?
So this particular student, James King, went around the beautiful English countryside, picked the best, best cow that he could see, and then put her in the MRI machine.
Then, he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat -- of course, this is done with a Japanese resins food maker, but you know, in the future it could be made better -- which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find.
Instead, this element here is much more banal.
Something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue, so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one -- literally.
So, this is indeed made of human bone tissue.
This is SymbioticA, and they've been working -- they were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat -- and now they've also done an in-vitro coat, a leather coat.
It's miniscule, but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one.
So, we'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future.
One of the most important topics of the show -- you know, as anything in our life today, we can look at it from many, many different viewpoints, and at different levels.
One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale. We change scale very often: we change resolution of screens, and we're not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably.
So you go, even in the exhibition, from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data -- the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world.
In this particular case a section will be devoted to information design.
You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is "Human vs. Chimps" -- the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps.
It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine.
And here's the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized with all the go-to, go-back-to, also made into a beautiful choreography.
And then also graphs by scientists, this beautiful diagraph of protein homology.
Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics.
We were discussing with Keith Shrubb* this morning the fact that many scientists tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations, otherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes.
So they pick the worst background from any kind of PowerPoint presentation, the worst typeface.
It's only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first "pretty" -- if we can say so -- scientific presentations.
Another aspect of contemporary design that I think is mind-opening, promising and will really be the future of design, is the idea of collective design.
You know, the whole XO laptop, from One Laptop per Child, is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking.
So, the more the merrier.
The more computers, the stronger the signal, and children work on the interface so that it's all based on doing things together, tasks together.
So the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future, and this is chosen as an example.
Related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance between the individual and the collectiveness, collectivity is the idea of existence maximum.
That's a term that I coined a few years ago while I was thinking of how pressed we are together, and at the same time how these small objects, like the Walkman first and then the iPod, create bubbles of space around us that enable us to have a metaphysical space that is much bigger than our physical space.
You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your iPod.
And this is the work of several designers that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion by means of various techniques.
This is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa, you have a massage, you have a facial, maybe a rub, and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature, and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time.
And same thing here, Social Tele-presence.
It's actually already used by the military a little bit, but it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else with your senses while you're removed from it physically.
And this is called Blind Date. It's a [unclear], so if you're too shy to be really at the date, you can stay at a distance with your flowers and somebody else reenacts the date for you.
Rapid manufacturing is another big area in which technology and design are, I think, bound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times.
Rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine.
It used to be called rapid prototyping, rapid modeling.
It started out in the '80s, but at the beginning it was machines carving out of a foam block a model that was very, very fragile, and could not have any real use.
Slowly but surely, the materials became better -- better resins.
Techniques became better -- not only carving but also stereolithography and laser -- solidifying all kinds of resins, whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger, to the point that now we can have actual chairs made by rapid manufacturing.
It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair, but you know what? One day it will take seven hours.
And then the dream is that you'll be able to, from home, customize your chair. You know, companies and designers will be designing the matrix or the margins that respect both solidity and brand, and design identity.
And then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner and go get your chair. Now, the implications of this are enormous, not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process, but also no tracking, no warehousing, no wasted materials.
Also, I can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans and maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change.
And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine -- you know, the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much -- that shows you can have your desktop 3D printer and print your own basketball.
But here instead are examples, you can already 3D-print textiles, which is very interesting.
This is just a really nice touch -- it's called slow prototyping.
It's a designer that put 10,000 bees at work and they built this vase.
They had a particular shape that they had to stay in.
Mapping and tagging.
As the capacity of computers becomes really, really big, and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger, we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do in order to then retrace our path.
Also, we do it in order to share with other people.
Again, this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today.
So, various ways to map and tag are also the work of many designers nowadays.
Also, the senses -- designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more.
And also animal senses in a way.
This particular object that many people love so much is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment -- the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense, and so -- much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer -- bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex to detect one type of cancer, and also pregnancy.
And so this student at the RCA designed this beautiful blown-glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies, in this case, pregnancy.
Another shape is made for cancer.
Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves.
Some designers don't design objects, products, things that we're going to actually use, but rather, they design scenarios that are object-based.
They're still very useful.
They help companies and other designers think better about the future.
And usually they are accompanied by videos.
This is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby, "All the Robots."
Those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of.
We always think that robots will take care of us, and instead they designed these robots that are very, very needy.
You need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes for about five minutes before it does something.
Another one gets really, really nervous if you get in to the room, and starts shaking, so you have to calm it down.
So it's really a way to make us think more about what robots mean to us.
Noam Toran and "Accessories for Lonely Men": the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad breakup, what you miss the most are those annoying things that you used to hate when you were with the other person.
So he designed all these series of accessories.
This one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night.
Then there's another one that breathes on your neck.
There's another one that throws plates and breaks them.
So it's just this idea of what we really miss in life.
Elio Caccavale: he took the idea of those dolls that explain leukemia.
He's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation, and also the spider gene into the goat, from a few years ago.
He's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls that explain to children where babies come from today.
Because it's not anymore Mom, Dad, the flowers and the bees, and then there's the baby. No, it can be two moms, three dads, in-vitro -- there's the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed.
So it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now.
One of the most beautiful things is that designers really work on life, even though they take technology into account.
And many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning, and what we can do about it today with new technologies.
Or how we should behave about it with new technologies.
These three objects over there are hard drives with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality very, very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away.
So instead of having only the pictures, you will be able to put this object next to the computer and all of a sudden have, you know, Gertrude's whole life and all of her files and her address book come alive.
And this is even better. This is Auger-Loizeau, "AfterLife."
It's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife.
So to give them something tangible that shows that there is something after death, they take the gastric juices of people who passed away and concentrate them, and put them into a battery that can actually be used to power flashlights. They also go -- you know, sex toys, whatever.
It's quite amazing how these things can make you smile, can make you laugh, can make you cry sometimes.
But I'm hoping that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going -- which is always, hopefully, a portrait a few years in advance of where the world is going.
Thank you very much.

One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.
I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.
So when I thought about compassion, my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips, where he's lying there and he says, "I really understand, and I really appreciate how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself.
The only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them."
This, in a way, is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea.
We all, I think, believe in compassion.
If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions, you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.
So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah, that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.
And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel, who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself.
And all the main religions have similar teachings.
And again, within Judaism, we have a teaching about God, who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.
After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?
And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God, so we too have to be compassionate.
But what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life?
Sometimes, of course, being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control.
I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral, or when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying, and I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty, the challenge that is there for the family, for the person.
And I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes.
And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings, I wouldn't be doing my job -- because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.
And yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion, then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbi.
And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.
Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war, or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis?
I know some people who say "Well, you know there's just so much out there -- I can't do anything, I'm not going to even begin to try."
And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.
There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore, and so they turn off the television and don't watch.
In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.
You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others, but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people.
So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick.
And, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more.
And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation, which says that when God created the world, God thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice.
Because, after all, God is just.
Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world.
And then God looked to the future and realized, if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist.
So, God thought, "Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion."
And then God looked to the future and realized that, in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion, there would be anarchy and chaos.
There had to be limits to all things.
The rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.
If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.
If you put boiling water in, it will shatter.
What do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two.
And so God put both of these possibilities into the world.
There is something more though that has to be there.
And that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world, into action.
So, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors.
We actually have to do something about it.
And so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important: "chesed."
All these three things, then, have to be melded together.
The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living, what should we be doing, social justice.
There has to be a willingness to do good deeds, but not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity.
You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things.
And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion, which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.
This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God, who is ultimately the compassionate one.
What does this compassion entail?
It entails understanding the pain of the other.
But even more than that, it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation: understanding that one is part of that creation, that there is a unity that underlies all that we see, all that we hear, all that we feel.
I call that unity God.
And that unity is something that connects all of creation.
And, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement, we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things, that something I do here actually does matter in Africa, that if I use too much of my carbon allowance, it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa.
So there is a connectivity, and I have to understand that -- as part of the creation, as part of me being made in the image of God.
And I have to understand that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs.
This "18 minutes" business, I find quite fascinating.
Because in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters, stands for life -- the word "life."
So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say, "In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion."
But, something else as well: actually, 18 minutes is important.
Because at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread, the rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread, and dough that is made into unleavened bread, or "matzah"?
And they say "It's 18 minutes."
Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.
What does it mean, "dough becomes leaven"?
It means it gets filled with hot air.
What's matzah? What's unleavened bread? You don't get it.
Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover, what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride, our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world, and that everything should revolve round us.
So we try and get rid of those, and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas that enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision so we don't see the needs of others -- and free ourselves and free ourselves from that.
And that too is a basis for having compassion, for understanding our place in the world.
Now there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.
And, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.
And as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah.
And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem, the priests used to have bread, which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem.
The man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up.
He said, "God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants."
And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread, took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue, opened the ark and said, "God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are."
And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah.
Then he went home.
The cleaner came into the synagogue.
"Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed.
My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?"
He goes into the synagogue. "God, will you please help me?
Ah, what a wonderful smell."
He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.
"There's bread! God, you've answered my plea. You've answered my question."
Takes the bread and goes home.
Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself, "I'm an idiot. God wants bread?
God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"
He rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."
He goes in there, and it's not there.
And he says, "God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread.
Next week, with raisins."
This went on for years.
Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins, with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark.
Every week, the cleaner would come. "God you've answered my plea again."
Take the bread. Take it home.
Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things.
The rabbi came in and saw what was going on.
And he called the two of them to his office.
And he said, you know, "This is what's happening."
And the rich man -- oh, dear -- crestfallen.
"You mean God didn't want my bread?"
And the poor man said, "And you mean God didn't answer my pleas?"
And the rabbi said, "You've misunderstood me.
You've misunderstood totally," he said.
"Of course, what you are doing," he said to the rich man, "is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate.
And God," he said to the poor man, "is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give."
He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said, "Don't you understand?" He said, "These are the hands of God."
So that is the way I feel: that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate, of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world; that I want to try and serve that unity, and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope, trying to understand something of the pain of others; but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them; and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy, to the giving I can give.
I have to reevaluate them, try and separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me, so that I can see the world clearly.
And then I have to try to see in what ways I can make these the hands of God.
And so try to bring compassion to life in this world.

<title>Jackie Tabick: The balancing act of compassion</title>
<description>While we all agree that compassion is a great idea, Rabbi Tabick acknowledges there are challenges to its execution. She explains how a careful balance of compassion and justice allows us to do good deeds, and keep our sanity.</description>

So, indeed, I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive.
Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning, thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night.
But when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life, my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson.
He taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms: work, love and play.
And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other, is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age.
Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication, is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement, but with serenity.
So since I tell stories, let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point -- Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.
As for that first sphere of work, I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing.
He had a huge ambition.
But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame -- what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.
Even as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams.
He somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farm from which he was born.
No schooling was possible for him, except a few weeks here, a few weeks there.
But he read books in every spare moment he could find.
It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or "Aesop's Fables," he was so excited he couldn't sleep.
He couldn't eat.
The great poet Emily Dickinson once said, "There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away."
How true for Lincoln.
Though he never would travel to Europe, he went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England, he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal.
Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings.
But there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death.
His mother died when he was only nine years old; his only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later; and his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22.
Moreover, when his mother lay dying, she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an afterworld.
She simply said to him, "Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return."
As a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away -- dust to dust.
But only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion -- but followed by other cultures as well -- that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life, you could live on in the memory of others.
Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.
And that worthy ambition became his lodestar.
It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s.
Three things had combined to lay him low.
He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd, not certain he was ready to marry her, but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that.
His one intimate friend, Joshua Speed, was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died.
And his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide.
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal.
They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room.
And his great friend Speed went to his side and said, "Lincoln, you must rally or you will die."
He said that, "I would just as soon die right now, but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived."
So fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature.
He eventually won a seat in Congress.
He then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice.
"Everyone is broken by life," Ernest Hemingway once said, "but some people are stronger in the broken places."
So then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced, far more educated, far more celebrated rivals.
And then when he won the general election, he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet.
It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought, "He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people."
They said, "Why are you doing this, Lincoln?"
He said, "Look, these are the strongest and most able men in the country.
The country is in peril. I need them by my side."
But perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion: "Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out, than outside the tent pissing in."
But it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team.
For each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé.
For one thing, he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view.
He repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility.
He shared credit with ease, assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates, constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes.
These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.
He refused to be provoked by petty grievances.
He never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights.
And he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language, in metaphors, in stories.
And with a beauty of language -- almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul.
In 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, he brought his old friend, Joshua Speed, back to the White House, and remembered that conversation of decades before, when he was so sad.
And he, pointing to the Proclamation, said, "I believe, in this measure, my fondest hopes will be realized."
But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception.
So he put the pen down.
He said, "If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act.
But if I sign with a shaking hand, posterity will say, 'He hesitated.'" So he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand.
But even in his wildest dreams, Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach.
I was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer, Leo Tolstoy, in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s.
And in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus, where there were only wild barbarians, who had never left this part of Russia.
Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst, they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history.
So he said, "I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great and Julius Caesar, and they loved it.
But before I finished, the chief of the barbarians stood up and said, 'But wait, you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all.
We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder, who laughed like the sunrise, who came from that place called America, which is so far from here, that if a young man should travel there, he would be an old man when he arrived.
Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'" He was stunned.
He told them everything he could about Lincoln.
And then in the interview he said, "What made Lincoln so great?
Not as great a general as Napoleon, not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great."
But his greatness consisted, and historians would roundly agree, in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being.
So in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized.
That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself, to go through that string of political failures and the darkest days of the war.
His story would be told.
So as for that second sphere, not of work, but of love -- encompassing family, friends and colleagues -- it, too, takes work and commitment.
The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life, when I helped him on his memoirs, was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work, power and individual success, that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone.
My relationship with him began on a rather curious level.
I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old.
We had a big dance at the White House.
President Johnson did dance with me that night.
Not that peculiar -- there were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows.
But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House.
But it was not to be that simple.
For in the months leading up to my selection, like many young people, I'd been active in the anti-Vietnam War movement, and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson, which unfortunately came out in The New Republic two days after the dance in the White House.
And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.
So I was certain he would kick me out of the program.
But instead, surprisingly, he said, "Oh, bring her down here for a year, and if I can't win her over, no one can."
So I did end up working for him in the White House.
Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs, never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with.
I like to believe it was because I was a good listener.
He was a great storyteller.
Fabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories.
There was a problem with these stories, however, which I later discovered, which is that half of them weren't true.
But they were great, nonetheless.
So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales.
But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman.
And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation.
So I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends, even when I didn't have any at all.
Everything was working perfectly, until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship.
Sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake, conveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson.
And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth -- all the romantic trappings.
And he started out, "Doris, more than any other woman I have ever known ... " And my heart sank.
And then he said, "You remind me of my mother."
It was pretty embarrassing, given what was going on in my mind.
But I must say, the older I've gotten, the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man.
A victor in a thousand contests, three great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education.
And yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam.
And because he was so sad and so vulnerable, he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power -- sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries.
And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure, that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.
But it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life.
For on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years, in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency; he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted; he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city, sailboats, speedboats.
He had servants to answer any whim, and he had a family who loved him deeply.
And yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.
It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it.
As his spirits sagged, his body deteriorated until, I believe, he slowly brought about his own death.
In those last years, he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him.
He spoke with immense sadness in his voice, saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children, and their children in turn.
But it was too late.
Despite all that power, all that wealth, he was alone when he finally died -- his ultimate terror realized.
So as for that third sphere of play, which he never had learned to enjoy, I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy -- enough so that a hobby, a sport, a love of music, or art, or literature, or any form of recreation, can provide true pleasure, relaxation and replenishment.
So deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare, that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater, even during those dark days of the war.
He said, when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on, for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time.
But an even more important form of relaxation for him, that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy, was a love of -- somehow -- humor, and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce as a sidelight to the sadness.
He once said that he laughed so he did not cry, that a good story, for him, was better than a drop of whiskey.
His storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois.
The lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other, and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town, they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories.
He would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales.
And all these stories became part of his memory bank, so he could call on them whenever he needed to.
And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.
One of his favorite stories, for example, had to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.
And as Lincoln told the story, Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war.
And the British people were still upset about losing the Revolution, so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it.
They figured he'd be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse.
But he came out of the outhouse not upset at all.
And so they said, "Well, did you see George Washington in there?"
"Oh, yes," he said, "perfectly appropriate place for him."
"What do you mean?" they said.
"Well," he said, "there's nothing to make an Englishman shit faster than the sight of General George Washington."
So you can imagine, if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting -- and he had hundreds of these stories -- you would have to relax.
So between his nightly treks to the theater, his story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry, he found that form of play which carried him through his days.
In my own life, I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball.
Which allows me, from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall, to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work.
It all began when I was only six years old, and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games -- so that when he went to work in New York during the day, I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodgers game.
Now, when you're only six years old, and your father comes home every single night and listens to you -- as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail, recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon.
But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story.
It makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention.
In fact, I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father.
Because at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out, "The Dodgers won!" or, "The Dodgers lost!"
Which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away.
So I finally learned you had to tell a story from beginning to middle to end.
I must say, so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball.
The first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher, Roy Campanella, came to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island, just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion.
And I was so excited -- first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field.
But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church.
When you are brought up as a Catholic, you think that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church, you'll be struck dead at the threshold.
So I went to my father in tears, "What are we going to do?"
He said, "Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall.
We're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship.
It's not a sin."
But as I left that night, I was certain that somehow I'd traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella.
And there were no indulgences around that I could buy.
So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession.
I told the priest right away.
He said, "No problem. It wasn't a religious service."
But then, unfortunately, he said, "And what else, my child?"
And then came my second sin.
I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church, wishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters.
And he said, "To whom did you wish harm?"
And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players would break arms, legs and ankles -- -- so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series.
He said, "How often do you make these horrible wishes?"
And I had to say, every night when I said my prayers.
So he said, "Look, I'll tell you something.
I love the Brooklyn Dodgers, as you do, but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely.
You do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen."
"Oh yes," I said.
But luckily, my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest!
Well, though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s, before I had gotten married and had my three sons, I have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys.
Though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A., I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston and became an irrational Red Socks fan.
And I must say, even now, when I sit with my sons with our season tickets, I can sometimes close my eyes against the sun and imagine myself, a young girl once more, in the presence of my father, watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below: Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, and Duke Snider.
I must say there is magic in these moments.
When I open my eyes and I see my sons in the place where my father once sat, I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see, but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told.
Which is why, in the end, I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history, allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past.
Allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life.
Allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families, and the public figures we have respected in our history, just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe, really can live on, so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives.
Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today.
Thank you.

<title>Doris Kearns Goodwin: Lessons from past presidents</title>
<description>Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin talks about what we can learn from American presidents, including Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson. Then she shares a moving memory of her own father, and of their shared love of baseball.</description>

Across Europe and Central Asia, approximately one million children live in large residential institutions, usually known as orphanages.
Most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children.
Others know more about the living conditions there, but still think they're a necessary evil.
After all, where else would we put all of those children who don't have any parents?
But 60 years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development, and this is particularly true for young babies.
As we know, babies are born without their full muscle development, and that includes the brain.
During the first three years of life, the brain grows to its full size, with most of that growth taking place in the first six months. The brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation.
Every time a young baby learns something new -- to focus its eyes, to mimic a movement or a facial expression, to pick something up, to form a word or to sit up -- new synaptic connections are being built in the brain.
New parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning.
They are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness.
They communicate their delight to their children, who respond with smiles, and a desire to achieve more and to learn more.
This forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical, social, language, cognitive and psychomotor development.
It is the model for all future relationships with friends, with partners and with their own children.
It happens so naturally in most families that we don't even notice it. Most of us are unaware of its importance to human development and, by extension, to the development of a healthy society.
And it's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children.
In August, 1993, I had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting.
Those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of Romania after the 1989 revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions.
I was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families.
Housing 550 babies, this was Ceausescu's show orphanage, and so I'd been told the conditions were much better.
Having worked with lots of young children, I expected the institution to be a riot of noise, but it was as silent as a convent.
It was hard to believe there were any children there at all, yet the director showed me into room after room, each containing row upon row of cots, in each of which lay a child staring into space.
In a room of 40 newborns, not one of them was crying.
Yet I could see soiled nappies, and I could see that some of the children were distressed, but the only noise was a low, continuous moan.
The head nurse told me proudly, "You see, our children are very well-behaved."
Over the next few days, I began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional.
The newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours, but their demands were not met, and so eventually they learned not to bother. Within a few days, they were listless, lethargic, and staring into space like all the others.
Over the years, many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children, but often, one member of staff is caring for 10, 20, and even 40 children.
Hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program.
The children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7:30.
At 8, their nappies must be changed, so a staff member may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children.
If a child soils its nappy at 8:30, he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again.
The child's daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing, and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling, the walls or the bars of their cots.
Since my first visit to Ceausescu's institution, I've seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries, from the Czech Republic to Sudan.
Across all of these diverse lands and cultures, the institutions, and the child's journey through them, is depressingly similar.
Lack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors like hand-flapping, rocking back and forth, or aggression, and in some institutions, psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children, whilst in others, children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others.
These children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities.
Most of these children will never leave the institution again.
For those without disabilities, at age three, they're transferred to another institution, and at age seven, to yet another. Segregated according to age and gender, they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings, often without even a chance to say goodbye.
There's rarely enough to eat. They are often hungry.
The older children bully the little ones. They learn to survive. They learn to defend themselves, or they go under.
When they leave the institution, they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society.
In Moldova, young women raised in institutions are 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers, and a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions, young adults, 20 percent of them had a criminal record, 14 percent were involved in prostitution, and 10 percent had taken their own lives.
But why are there so many orphans in Europe when there hasn't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years?
In fact, more than 95 percent of these children have living parents, and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children, but research shows that most parents want their children, and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty, disability and ethnicity.
Many countries have not developed inclusive schools, and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school, at age six or seven.
The institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home.
If the family's poor, they find it difficult to visit, and gradually the relationship breaks down.
Behind each of the million children in institutions, there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they've run out of options, like Natalia in Moldova, who only had enough money to feed her baby, and so had to send her older son to the institution; or Desi, in Bulgaria, who looked after her four children at home until her husband died, but then she had to go out to work full time, and with no support, felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they're pregnant, who leave their babies in a hospital; or the new parents, the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability, and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child's potential, are told by the doctors, "Forget her, leave her in the institution, go home and make a healthy one."
This state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable.
Every child has the right to a family, deserves and needs a family, and children are amazingly resilient.
We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on, they recover their developmental delays, and go on to lead normal, happy lives.
It's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions.
One study suggests that a family support service costs 10 percent of an institutional placement, whilst good quality foster care costs usually about 30 percent.
If we spend less on these children but on the right services, we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs.
Across Europe, a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community-based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential. When I first started to work in Romania nearly 20 years ago, there were 200,000 children living in institutions, and more entering every day.
Now, there are less than 10,000, and family support services are provided across the country.
In Moldova, despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis, the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than 50 percent in the last five years, and the resources are being redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools.
Many countries have developed national action plans for change.
The European Commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support, empowering communities to look after their own children.
But there is still much to be done to end the systematic institutionalization of children.
Awareness-raising is required at every level of society.
People need to know the harm that institutions cause to children, and the better alternatives that exist.
If we know people who are planning to support orphanages, we should convince them to support family services instead.
Together, this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime.
Thank you.

What is so special about the human brain?
Why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us?
What does a human brain have or do that no other brain does?
When I became interested in these questions about 10 years ago, scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of.
Though it was based on very little evidence, many scientists thought that all mammalian brains, including the human brain, were made in the same way, with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size of the brain.
This means that two brains of the same size, like these two, with a respectable 400 grams, should have similar numbers of neurons.
Now, if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain, then the owners of these two brains should have similar cognitive abilities.
And yet, one is a chimp, and the other is a cow.
Now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it, but we eat them.
I think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more complex, elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are.
So this is a first indication that the "all brains are made the same way" scenario is not quite right.
But let's play along.
If all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes, larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains, and the larger the brain, the more cognitively able its owner should be.
So the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able.
Our brain, not the largest one around.
It seems quite vexing.
Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos, but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos, and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos, which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities.
It must be really extraordinary, an exception to the rule.
Theirs may be bigger, but ours is better, and it could be better, for example, in that it seems larger than it should be, with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies.
So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body.
That's because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body.
So the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes.
Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are, so their brains should also be larger than ours, but instead it's the other way around.
Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain.
The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses.
Although it weighs only two percent of the body, it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day.
That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories, just to keep your brain working.
So the human brain is larger than it should be, it uses much more energy than it should, so it's special.
And this is where the story started to bother me.
In biology, we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general, so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but not to us?
Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way.
Maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons.
Maybe a very large brain does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest-sized brain.
Maybe the human brain actually has the most neurons of any brain, regardless of its size, especially in the cerebral cortex.
So this to me became the important question to answer: how many neurons does the human brain have, and how does that compare to other animals?
Now, you may have heard or read somewhere that we have 100 billion neurons, so 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from.
But nobody did.
I've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number, and I could never find it.
It seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain, or in any other brain for that matter.
So I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain, and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup.
It works like this: You take a brain, or parts of that brain, and you dissolve it in detergent, which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact, so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this, like a clear soup.
This soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain.
Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup, you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid, so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution, you can count nuclei, and therefore tell how many cells that brain had.
It's simple, it's straightforward, and it's really fast.
So we've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far, and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way.
Take rodents and primates, for instance: In larger rodent brains, the average size of the neuron increases, so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons.
But primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger, which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain.
The result is that a primate brain will always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size, and the larger the brain, the larger this difference will be.
Well, what about our brain then?
We found that we have, on average, 86 billion neurons, 16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex, and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reasoning, and that 16 billion is the most neurons that any cortex has, I think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities.
But just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean.
Because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically, we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain.
So, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons would weigh 36 kilos.
That's not possible.
A brain that huge would be crushed by its own weight, and this impossible brain would go in the body of 89 tons.
I don't think it looks like us.
So this brings us to a very important conclusion already, which is that we are not rodents.
The human brain is not a large rat brain.
Compared to a rat, we might seem special, yes, but that's not a fair comparison to make, given that we know that we are not rodents.
We are primates, so the correct comparison is to other primates.
And there, if you do the math, you find that a generic primate with 86 billion neurons would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos, which seems just right, in a body of some 66 kilos, which in my case is exactly right, which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion: I am a primate.
And all of you are primates.
And so was Darwin.
I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this.
His brain, like ours, was made in the image of other primate brains.
So the human brain may be remarkable, yes, but it is not special in its number of neurons.
It is just a large primate brain.
I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought that should remind us of our place in nature.
Why does it cost so much energy, then?
Well, other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs, and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of, we could do the math.
And it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same, an average of six calories per billion neurons per day.
So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple, linear function of its number of neurons, and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect.
So the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons, and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal, the relative cost of our brain is large, but just because we're primates, not because we're special.
Last question, then: how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons, and in particular, if great apes are larger than we are, why don't they have a larger brain than we do, with more neurons?
When we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured, maybe there's a simple reason.
They just can't afford the energy for both a large body and a large number of neurons.
So we did the math.
We calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods, and on the other hand, how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs, and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day.
And what we found is that because neurons are so expensive, there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons.
So a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most 53 billion neurons, but then its body cannot be any bigger than 25 kilos.
To weigh any more than that, it has to give up neurons.
So it's either a large body or a large number of neurons.
When you eat like a primate, you can't afford both.
One way out of this metabolic limitation would be to spend even more hours per day eating, but that gets dangerous, and past a certain point, it's just not possible.
Gorillas and orangutans, for instance, afford about 30 billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating, and that seems to be about as much as they can do.
Nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate.
What about us?
With our 86 billion neurons and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass, we should have to spend over nine hours per day every single day feeding, which is just not feasible.
If we ate like a primate, we should not be here.
How did we get here, then?
Well, if our brain costs just as much energy as it should, and if we can't spend every waking hour of the day feeding, then the only alternative, really, is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods.
And remarkably, that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago, when they invented cooking.
To cook is to use fire to pre-digest foods outside of your body.
Cooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth, so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut, which makes them yield much more energy in much less time.
So cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day and with our neurons than just thinking about food, looking for food, and gobbling down food all day long.
So because of cooking, what once was a major liability, this large, dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons, could now become a major asset, now that we could both afford the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them.
So I think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution, all of the while remaining just a primate brain.
With this large brain now affordable by cooking, we went rapidly from raw foods to culture, agriculture, civilization, grocery stores, electricity, refrigerators, all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint.
So what once was a solution now became the problem, and ironically, we look for the solution in raw food.
So what is the human advantage?
What is it that we have that no other animal has?
My answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex, and I think that's the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities.
And what is it that we do that no other animal does, and which I believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large, largest number of neurons in the cortex?
In two words, we cook.
No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do.
And I think that's how we got to become human.
Studying the human brain changed the way I think about food.
I now look at my kitchen, and I bow to it, and I thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans.
Thank you very much.

<title>Suzana Herculano-Houzel: What is so special about the human brain?</title>
<description>The human brain is puzzling -- it is curiously large given the size of our bodies, uses a tremendous amount of energy for its weight and has a bizarrely dense cerebral cortex. But: why? Neuroscientist Suzana Herculano-Houzel puts on her detective's cap and leads us through this mystery. By making "brain soup," she arrives at a startling conclusion.</description>

Planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling, but whose streets we can't walk.
By studying those twinkling lights though, we can learn about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life.
In this image of the Tokyo skyline, I've hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block, the Kepler Mission.
Can you see it?
There we go.
This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at, where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars, all at once, every half hour, and very precisely.
And what we're looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us.
In just over two years of operations, we've found over 1,200 potential new planetary systems around other stars.
To give you some perspective, in the previous two decades of searching, we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler.
When we see these little dips in the light, we can determine a number of things.
For one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there, but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star.
That distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall.
And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire: You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm, but not so close that you're too toasty and you get burned.
However, there's more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall.
And I'll tell you why.
This is our star. This is our Sun.
It's shown here in visible light.
That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes.
You'll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball -- that Sun that we all draw when we're children.
But you'll notice something else, and that's that the face of the Sun has freckles.
These freckles are called sunspots, and they are just one of the manifestations of the Sun's magnetic field.
They also cause the light from the star to vary.
And we can measure this very, very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects.
However, these are just the tip of the iceberg.
If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes, we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our Sun's magnetic activity -- the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well.
Just think, even when it's cloudy outside, these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time.
So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable, whether it might be amenable to life, we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is, but we want to know about its space weather -- this high-energy radiation, the UV and the X-rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation.
And so, we can't really look at planets around other stars that we can look at planets in our own solar system.
I'm showing here Venus, Earth and Mars -- three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size, but only one of which is really a good place to live.
But what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe.
Kepler won't find a planet around every single star it looks at.
But really, every measurement it makes is precious, because it's teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets, and how it's really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe.
While it's Kepler the telescope, the instrument that stares, it's we, life, who are searching.
Thank you.

<title>Lucianne Walkowicz: Finding planets around other stars</title>
<description>How do we find planets -- even habitable planets -- around other stars? By looking for tiny dimming as a planet passes in front of its sun, Fellow Lucianne Walkowicz and the Kepler mission have found some 1,200 potential new planetary systems. With new techniques, they may even find ones with the right conditions for life.</description>

I'm going to talk to you today about the design of medical technology for low resource settings.
I study health systems in these countries.
And one of the major gaps in care, almost across the board, is access to safe surgery.
Now one of the major bottlenecks that we've found that's sort of preventing both the access in the first place and the safety of those surgeries that do happen is anesthesia.
And actually, it's the model that we expect to work for delivering anesthesia in these environments.
Here we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the U.S. or any other developed country.
In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine.
And this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives because it was designed with this environment in mind.
In order to operate, this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer.
It needs an extremely well-trained anesthesiologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monitor the flows of the gas and keep her patients safe and anesthetized throughout the surgery.
It's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms, and it needs special care, TLC, to keep it up and running, and it's going to break pretty easily.
And when it does, it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities, can fix it, can source the parts and keep it saving lives.
It's a pretty expensive machine.
It needs a hospital whose budget can allow it to support one machine costing upwards of 50 or $100,000.
And perhaps most obviously, and perhaps most importantly -- and the path to concepts that we've heard about kind of illustrate this -- it needs infrastructure that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity, of compressed oxygen and other medical supplies that are so critical to the functioning of this machine.
In other words, this machine requires a lot of stuff that this hospital cannot offer.
This is the electrical supply for a hospital in rural Malawi.
In this hospital, there is one person qualified to deliver anesthesia, and she's qualified because she has 12, maybe 18 months of training in anesthesia.
In the hospital and in the entire region there's not a single biomedical engineer.
So when this machine breaks, the machines they have to work with break, they've got to try and figure it out, but most of the time, that's the end of the road.
Those machines go the proverbial junkyard.
And the price tag of the machine that I mentioned could represent maybe a quarter or a third of the annual operating budget for this hospital.
And finally, I think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong.
This hospital is connected to a very weak power grid, one that goes down frequently.
So it runs frequently, the entire hospital, just on a generator.
And you can imagine, the generator breaks down or runs out of fuel.
And the World Bank sees this and estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low-income country can expect up to 18 power outages per month.
Similarly compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury and can often be out of stock for months or even a year.
So it seems crazy, but the model that we have right now is taking those machines that were designed for that first environment that I showed you and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment.
It's not just inappropriate, it becomes really unsafe.
One of our partners at Johns Hopkins was observing surgeries in Sierra Leone about a year ago.
And the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case.
A woman came in, she needed an emergency C-section to save her life and the life of her baby.
And everything began pretty auspiciously.
The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in.
The nurse was there.
She was able to anesthetize her quickly, and it was important because of the emergency nature of the situation.
And everything began well until the power went out.
And now in the middle of this surgery, the surgeon is racing against the clock to finish his case, which he can do -- he's got a headlamp.
But the nurse is literally running around a darkened operating theater trying to find anything she can use to anesthetize her patient, to keep her patient asleep.
Because her machine doesn't work when there's no power.
And now this routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced, and others are probably the product of, has now become a tragedy.
And what's so frustrating is this is not a singular event; this happens across the developing world.
35 million surgeries are attempted every year without safe anesthesia.
My colleague, Dr. Paul Fenton, was living this reality.
He was the chief of anesthesiology in a hospital in Malawi, a teaching hospital.
He went to work every day in an operating theater like this one, trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable, and frankly unsafe, in his hospital.
And after umpteen surgeries and, you can imagine, really unspeakable tragedy, he just said, "That's it. I'm done. That's enough.
There has to be something better."
So he took a walk down the hall to where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them -- I think that's the scientific term -- and he just started tinkering.
He took one part from here and another from there, and he tried to come up with a machine that would work in the reality that he was facing.
And what he came up with was this guy, the prototype for the Universal Anesthesia Machine -- a machine that would work and anesthetize his patients no matter the circumstances that his hospital had to offer.
Here it is back at home at that same hospital, developed a little further, 12 years later, working on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics.
Now let me show you a little bit about how this machine works.
Voila!
Here she is.
When you have electricity, everything in this machine begins in the base.
There's a built-in oxygen concentrator down there.
Now you've heard me mention oxygen a few times at this point.
Essentially, to deliver anesthesia, you want as pure oxygen as possible, because eventually you're going to dilute it essentially with the gas.
And the mixture that the patient inhales needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen or else it can become dangerous.
But so in here when there's electricity, the oxygen concentrator takes in room air.
Now we know room air is gloriously free, it is abundant, and it's already 21 percent oxygen.
So all this concentrator does is take that room air in, filter it and send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent.
Now before that mixture hits the patient's lungs, it's going to pass by here -- you can't see it, but there's an oxygen sensor here -- that's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered.
Now if you don't have power, or, God forbid, the power cuts out in the middle of surgery, this machine transitions automatically, without even having to touch it, to drawing in room air from this inlet.
Everything else is the same.
The only difference is that now you're only working with 21 percent oxygen.
Now that used to be a dangerous guessing game, because you only knew if you had given too little oxygen once something bad happened.
But we've put a long-life battery backup on here.
This is the only part that's battery backed up.
But this gives control to the provider, whether there's power or not, because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving their patient.
In both cases, whether you have power or not, sometimes the patient needs help breathing.
It's just a reality of anesthesia. The lungs can be paralyzed.
And so we've just added this manual bellows.
We've seen surgeries for three or four hours to ventilate the patient on this.
So it's a straightforward machine.
I shudder to say simple; it's straightforward.
And it's by design.
And you do not need to be a highly trained, specialized anesthesiologist to use this machine, which is good because, in these rural district hospitals, you're not going to get that level of training.
It's also designed for the environment that it will be used in.
This is an incredibly rugged machine.
It has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts.
And so it's not going to break very easily, but if it does, virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver.
And finally, it's affordable.
This machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that I showed you earlier.
So in other words, what we have here is a machine that can enable surgery and save lives because it was designed for its environment, just like the first machine I showed you.
But we're not content to stop there.
Is it working?
Is this the design that's going to work in place?
Well we've seen good results so far.
This is in 13 hospitals in four countries, and since 2010, we've done well over 2,000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events.
So we're thrilled.
This really seems like a cost-effective, scalable solution to a problem that's really pervasive.
But we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals.
So to do that we've launched a number of partnerships with NGOs and universities to gather data on the user interface, on the types of surgeries it's appropriate for and ways we can enhance the device itself.
One of those partnerships is with Johns Hopkins just here in Baltimore.
They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore.
So we're taking this machine and recreating some of the operating theater crises that this machine might face in one of the hospitals that it's intended for, and in a contained, safe environment, evaluating its effectiveness.
We're then able to compare the results from that study with real world experience, because we're putting two of these in hospitals that Johns Hopkins works with in Sierra Leone, including the hospital where that emergency C-section happened.
So I've talked a lot about anesthesia, and I tend to do that.
I think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health.
And it really seems peripheral, we never think about it, until we don't have access to it, and then it becomes a gatekeeper.
Who gets surgery and who doesn't?
Who gets safe surgery and who doesn't?
But you know, it's just one of so many ways that design, appropriate design, can have an impact on health outcomes.
If more people in the health delivery space really working on some of these challenges in low-income countries could start their design process, their solution search, from outside of that proverbial box and inside of the hospital -- in other words, if we could design for the environment that exists in so many parts of the world, rather than the one that we wished existed -- we might just save a lot of lives.
Thank you very much.

I'm five years old, and I am very proud.
My father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in Ukraine.
Inside, it's a smelly, gaping hole in the ground, but outside, it's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun.
This makes me feel so proud, so important, that I appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends and I devise missions for us.
So we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free.
Four years earlier, when I was one, after the Chernobyl accident, the rain came down black, and my sister's hair fell out in clumps, and I spent nine months in the hospital.
There were no visitors allowed, so my mother bribed a hospital worker.
She acquired a nurse's uniform, and she snuck in every night to sit by my side.
Five years later, an unexpected silver lining.
Thanks to Chernobyl, we get asylum in the U.S.
I am six years old, and I don't cry when we leave home and we come to America, because I expect it to be a place filled with rare and wonderful things like bananas and chocolate and Bazooka bubble gum, Bazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside, Bazooka that we'd get once a year in Ukraine and we'd have to chew one piece for an entire week.
So the first day we get to New York, my grandmother and I find a penny in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family's staying in.
Only, we don't know that it's a homeless shelter.
We think that it's a hotel, a hotel with lots of rats.
So we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor, and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don't just lose money.
And I hold this penny in the palm of my hand, and it's sticky and rusty, but it feels like I'm holding a fortune.
I decide that I'm going to get my very own piece of Bazooka bubble gum.
And in that moment, I feel like a millionaire.
About a year later, I get to feel that way again when we find a bag full of stuffed animals in the trash, and suddenly I have more toys than I've ever had in my whole life.
And again, I get that feeling when we get a knock on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn, and my sister and I find a deliveryman with a box of pizza that we didn't order.
So we take the pizza, our very first pizza, and we devour slice after slice as the deliveryman stands there and stares at us from the doorway.
And he tells us to pay, but we don't speak English.
My mother comes out, and he asks her for money, but she doesn't have enough.
She walks 50 blocks to and from work every day just to avoid spending money on bus fare.
Then our neighbor pops her head in, and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza.
Everyone's upset.
But the pizza is delicious.
It doesn't hit me until years later just how little we had.
On our 10 year anniversary of being in the U.S., we decided to celebrate by reserving a room at the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the U.S.
The man at the front desk laughs, and he says, "You can't reserve a room here. This is a homeless shelter."
And we were shocked.
My husband Brian was also homeless as a kid.
His family lost everything, and at age 11, he had to live in motels with his dad, motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill.
And one time, when he finally got his box of Frosted Flakes back, it was crawling with roaches.
But he did have one thing.
He had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere containing nine comic books, two G.I. Joes painted to look like Spider-Man and five Gobots. And this was his treasure.
This was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams.
I'm going to tell you about one more formerly homeless member of our family.
This is Scarlett.
Once upon a time, Scarlet was used as bait in dog fights.
She was tied up and thrown into the ring for other dogs to attack so they'd get more aggressive before the fight.
And now, these days, she eats organic food and she sleeps on an orthopedic bed with her name on it, but when we pour water for her in her bowl, she still looks up and she wags her tail in gratitude.
Sometimes Brian and I walk through the park with Scarlett, and she rolls through the grass, and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gratitude.
We forget about all of our new middle-class frustrations and disappointments, and we feel like millionaires.
Thank you.

We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly, and in many of the places where it counts the most, women are, in fact, taking control of everything.
In my mother's day, she didn't go to college.
Not a lot of women did.
And now, for every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same.
Women, for the first time this year, became the majority of the American workforce.
And they're starting to dominate lots of professions -- doctors, lawyers, bankers, accountants.
Over 50 percent of managers are women these days, and in the 15 professions projected to grow the most in the next decade, all but two of them are dominated by women.
So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men, believe it or not, and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture -- what our romantic comedies look like, what our marriages look like, what our dating lives look like, and our new set of superheroes.
For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated -- tough, rugged, in control of his own environment.
A few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen, who is a parody of American manhood, and that's what we have in our commercials today.
The phrase "first-born son" is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me.
In American fertility clinics, 75 percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys.
And in places where you wouldn't think, such as South Korea, India and China, the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little, and families are no longer strongly preferring first-born sons.
If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots, you can see the evidence everywhere.
You can see it in college graduation patterns, in job projections, in our marriage statistics, you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later, and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference, that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women.
Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women.
The '20s and the '60s also come to mind.
But the difference is that, back then, it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires, whereas this time, it's not about passion, and it's not about any kind of movement.
This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in.
The 200,000-year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end, believe it or not, and that's why I talk about the "end of men."
Now all you men out there, this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes, because the point is that this is happening to all of us.
I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love.
And this is why I like to talk about this, because if we don't acknowledge it, then the transition will be pretty painful.
But if we do take account of it, then I think it will go much more smoothly.
I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.
I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else, and I started to notice a distinct pattern -- that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women.
And I remembered back to about 10 years ago when I read a book by Susan Faludi in which she described how hard the recession had hit men, and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession.
And I realized that two things were different this time around.
The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men -- that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy.
And second, that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men, but it was also about what was happening to women.
And now look at this second set of slides.
These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.
These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago.
Women, a majority of the workplace.
And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.
This second set of headlines -- you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift.
And look at that last headline -- young women earning more than young men.
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.
They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future.
And they expected that it would be young families, or young men, just like it had always been.
But in fact, they found something very surprising.
It was young, single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.
And so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding, to do a nationwide survey.
So they spread out all the census data, and what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker, which is that in 1,997 out of 2,000 communities, women, young women, were making more money than young men.
So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them.
Now, I've just laid out the picture for you, but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening.
And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph, and what you'll see on this graph -- it begins in 1973, just before women start flooding the workforce, and it brings us up to our current day.
And basically what you'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy.
Now what does that mean?
It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage jobs -- and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs, and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.
This has been going on for 40 years now.
But this process is affecting men very differently than it's affecting women.
You'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue.
You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class, but see what happens to women and see what happens to men.
There we go.
So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class.
Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men.
The men sort of stagnate there, while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.
So what's that about?
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game, or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high.
But of course, it's not about that.
What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot.
We used to have a manufacturing economy, which was about building goods and products, and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy.
Those two economies require very different skills, and as it happens, women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been.
It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn't have a college degree, but you had a specific set of skills, and with the help of a union, you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.
But that really isn't true anymore.
This new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength, which is what's helped men along all these years.
What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills.
You basically need intelligence, you need an ability to sit still and focus, to communicate openly, to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be, and those are things that women do extremely well, as we're seeing.
If you look at management theory these days, it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like General Patton, right?
You would be issuing orders from above.
You would be very hierarchical.
You would tell everyone below you what to do.
But that's not what an ideal leader is like now.
If you read management books now, a leader is somebody who can foster creativity, who can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say "his" -- who can get the employees to talk to each other, who can basically build teams and get them to be creative.
And those are all things that women do very well.
And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect.
Women enter the workplace at the top, and then at the working class, all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.
So that's childcare, elder care and food preparation.
So those are all the jobs that are growing, and those are jobs that women tend to do.
Now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out-of-work, middle-aged, former steelworker guy to watch their children at home, and that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.
To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now, you have to look at our future workforce.
And here the story is fairly simple.
Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men.
Why? This is a real mystery.
People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college, to community college, say, and retool themselves, learn a new set of skills?
Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that.
They're used to thinking of themselves as providers, and they can't seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college.
So for some reason men just don't end up going back to college.
And what's even more disturbing is what's happening with younger boys.
There's been about a decade of research about what people are calling the "boy crisis."
Now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys, for whatever reason, are doing worse in school than very young girls, and people have theories about that.
Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum, and little girls are better at that than little boys?
Or that we require kids to sit still too much, and so boys initially feel like failures?
And some people say it's because, in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.
Because I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it, so I don't have the answer.
But in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert, who's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa, to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse.
Noa: The girls are obviously smarter.
I mean they have much larger vocabulary.
They learn much faster.
They are more controlled.
On the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.
Hanna Rosin: And why is that?
Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely.
HR: So there you go.
This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to visit a college in Kansas City -- working-class college.
Certainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life -- that my husband and I would both work, and that we would equally raise the children.
But these college girls had a completely different view of their future.
Basically, the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day, that their husband would maybe have a job, but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies.
And this was kind of a shocker to me.
And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls: "Men are the new ball and chain."
Now you laugh, but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?
And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don't reverse themselves without a lot of pain, and that's why I talk about us all going through this together.
The night after I talked to these college girls, I also went to a men's group in Kansas, and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier.
They were men who had been contractors, or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom, and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.
And the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age.
He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority, that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore, and they were not really the providers.
So who were they?
And this was very disheartening for them.
And what he did was he wrote down on the board "$85,000," and he said, "That's her salary," and then he wrote down "$12,000."
"That's your salary.
So who's the man now?" he asked them.
"Who's the damn man?
She's the man now."
And that really sent a shudder through the room.
And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this, because I think it can be pretty painful, and we really have to work through it.
And the other reason it's kind of urgent is because it's not just happening in the U.S.
It's happening all over the world.
In India, poor women are learning English faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in India.
In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses, small businesses, faster than men.
And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.
Over several decades, South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about.
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code.
And if women failed to birth male children, they were basically treated like domestic servants.
And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child.
But over the '70s and '80s, the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize, and so what they did was, they started to push women into the workforce.
Now they've been asking a question since 1985: "How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?"
And now look at the chart.
That's from 1985 to 2003.
How much do you prefer a first-born son?
So you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture.
Now because we haven't fully processed this information, it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways, where you can see that the stereotypes are changing.
And so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the "omega males" popping up, who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can't find a job.
And they come up in lots of different forms.
So we have the perpetual adolescent.
We have the charmless misanthrope.
Then we have our Bud Light guy who's the happy couch potato.
And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive, the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie.
And then on the female side, you have the opposite, in which you have these crazy superhero women.
You've got Lady Gaga.
You've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie.
And it's not just for the young, right?
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.
And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we've got these uber-exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal.
So for a long time in the economic sphere, we've lived with the term "glass ceiling."
Now I've never really liked this term.
For one thing, it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another, because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling.
And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.
And we have a lot of skill and experience, but it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling?
And also, "shattering the glass ceiling" is a terrible phrase.
What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling?
So the image that I like to think of, instead of glass ceiling, is the high bridge.
It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge, but it's also pretty exhilarating, because it's beautiful up there, and you're looking out on a beautiful view.
And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling.
There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables.
There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through.
And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you.
You can bring your husband along.
You can bring your friends, or your colleagues, or your babysitter to walk along with you.
And husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready.
But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge, that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge, but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it.
Thanks very much.

Today, I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics.
I'm, among several other things, an electrical engineer, and that means that I spend a good amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology, and more specifically designing and building electronics.
And what I've found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways.
So it's a really slow process, it's really expensive, and the outcome of that process, namely electronic circuit boards, are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways.
So they're really small, generally, they're square and flat and hard, and frankly, most of them just aren't very attractive, and so my team and I have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics.
And so what if you could design and build electronics like this? So what if you could do it extremely quickly, extremely inexpensively, and maybe more interestingly, really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally?
Wouldn't that be so cool, and that wouldn't that open up all sorts of new possibilities?
I'm going to share with you two projects that are investigations along these lines, and we'll start with this one.
Magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper.
A conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC.
Sticker templates.
Speed x 4.
Making a switch.
Music: DJ Shadow.
Adding some intelligence with a microcontroller.
Sketching an interface.
Pretty cool, huh? We think so.
So now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things, we started to realize that, essentially, anything that we can do with paper, anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics.
So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that possibility.
And I'll kind of let it speak for itself.
So the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this, and so the way that we're approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools, and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques And so sometime soon, you'll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way.
So thank you very much.
<title>Leah Buechley: How to "sketch" with electronics</title>
<description>Designing electronics is generally cumbersome and expensive -- or was, until Leah Buechley and her team at MIT developed tools to treat electronics just like paper and pen. In this talk from TEDYouth 2011, Buechley shows some of her charming designs, like a paper piano you can sketch and then play.</description>

I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day, at the exact same moment, each conceiving a baby -- okay?
So two couples each conceiving one baby.
Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception, because if you spend all that time imagining that conception, you're not going to listen to me.
So just imagine that for a moment.
And in this scenario, I want to imagine that, in one case, the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome, meeting that X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case, the sperm is carrying an X chromosome, meeting the X chromosome of the egg.
Both are viable; both take off.
We'll come back to these people later.
So I wear two hats in most of what I do.
As the one hat, I do history of anatomy.
I'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies, animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies.
The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist, as a patient advocate -- or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate -- for people who are patients of doctors.
In that case, what I've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms.
So some of what I've worked on, for example, is people who are conjoined twins -- two people within one body.
Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism -- so people who are much shorter than typical.
And a lot of what I've worked on is people who have atypical sex -- so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types.
And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this.
Intersex comes in a lot of different forms.
I'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or female.
So in one instance, you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis, and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life, to become testes.
And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone.
But because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone, the body doesn't react to the testosterone.
And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.
As a consequence, the body develops more along the female typical path.
When the child is born, she looks like a girl.
She is a girl. She is raised as a girl.
And it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts, but she's not getting her period, that somebody figures out something's up here.
And they do some tests and figure out that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus, she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.
Now what's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male, but they're really not.
Females, like males, have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.
They're in the back of our body.
And the adrenal glands make androgens, which are a masculinizing hormone.
Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female -- I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up but I think I'm probably typical -- most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.
The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways, they can be all over the place.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.
What he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
He had XX chromosomes, and in the womb, his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.
And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed, his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones.
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything.
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally, that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally.
Okay, so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex.
Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis, which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it.
And we're not exactly sure why that happens.
So sex can come in lots of different varieties.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning, or it's an intersex type -- are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health.
In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.
The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories.
Or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity; what it means to be a black person is, allegedly, is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history.
And so we have this terribly simplistic idea.
And when we're faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different, it startles us in terms of those categorizations.
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism.
And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.
when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body.
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya, had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me, "Which is the test they're going to run that will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female?"
And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female, or between male and intersex and female and intersex; we actually draw that line on nature.
So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes, the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.
And it's not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed.
As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.
We look, for example, about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees.
What are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides?
And as we get farther and farther with our science, we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic.
So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life.
One of the places we're seeing it, for example, in our culture today, in the United States today, is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.
We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human, such that it has a different right than a fetal life.
We have very difficult conversations nowadays -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody's dead.
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead.
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose, and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.
If it stopped twitching, you bury them.
But today, we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings.
And as a consequence, we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who's dead, and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.
Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories would make somebody like me really happy.
I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
Understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.
And it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
So in order to tell you about that tension, I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.
I know they were racists, I know they were sexist, but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that cheesy musical "1776" every few years, and it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.
It's because of what happened in 1776 with the Founding Fathers.
The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view, the original anatomical activists, and this is why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.
So as you all recall, what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy, and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA, but they did have a concept of birthright.
They had a concept of blue blood.
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth.
The Founding Fathers rejected that idea, and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept, and that concept was all men are created equal.
They leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy, not the difference in anatomy, and that was a really radical thing to do.
Now they were doing it in part because they were part of an Enlightenment system where two things were growing up together.
And that was democracy growing up, but it was also science growing up at the same time.
And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers, a lot of them were very interested in science, and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world.
They were moving away from supernatural explanations, and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power, where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright.
They were moving towards a naturalistic concept.
And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence, they talk about nature and nature's God.
They don't talk about God and God's nature.
They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
So as part of that, they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality.
And in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights movement of the future.
They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
So what happened years afterward?
What happened was women, for example, who wanted the right to vote, took the Founding Fathers' concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said, "The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote, the right to full citizenship, the right to own property, etc., etc."
And women successfully argued that.
Next came the successful Civil Rights movement, where we found people like Sojourner Truth talking about, "Ain't I a woman?"
We find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I am a man."
Again, people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy, again, successfully.
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement.
The problem is, of course, that, as we begin to look at all that commonality, we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions.
Now mind you, I want to maintain some divisions, anatomically, in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.
I don't want to say five-year-olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.
So there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain.
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning.
So let's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both conceived in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.
Let's imagine one of them, Mary, is born three months prematurely, so she's born on June 1, 1980.
Henry, by contrast, is born at term, so he's born on March 1, 1980.
Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months, she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does -- the right to consent to sex, the right to vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that, not because he's actually any different in age, biologically, except in terms of when he was born.
We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.
Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male -- although I haven't told you that he's the XY one -- by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted, which Mary does not need to worry about.
Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states, namely, the right to marry.
Henry can marry in every state a woman, but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman.
So we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable.
And the question to me becomes: What do we do, as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy, that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that's been based on anatomy might start falling apart?
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us.
So where do we go?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude: "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we will draw the line somewhere."
But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.
So for example, Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome, and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome.
Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes.
But this is also very bizarre, because of the story I told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, he offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech.
He says we should judge people "based not on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character," moving beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of character?
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans, because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know.
So how do we operationalize the question of content of character?
It turns out to be really difficult.
And part of me also wonders, what if content of character turns out to be something that's scannable in the future -- able to be seen with an fMRI?
Do we really want to go there?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy.
We've done a really good job struggling with democracy, and I think we would do a good job in the future.
We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example, where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered, unless he's willing to submit to a sex change, in which case he's allowed to live.
We don't have that kind of situation.
I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.
But when I was on the phone with him, asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-risk surgery -- his answer was that, in this other nation, these children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this.
My response to him was, "Well, have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery?"
The United States has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are, without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be in the lead.
Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you that I've been talking a lot about the fathers.
And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like, if we had more involved the mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies, particularly when we have people thinking in groups.
Now for years, because I've been interested in intersex, I've also been interested in sex difference research.
And one of the things that I've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world.
And what we know from cross-cultural studies is that females, on average -- not everyone, but on average -- are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group.
And so if we think about that, we have an interesting situation on our hands.
Years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- I considered myself a feminist, as I still do -- asked a really strange question.
He said, "Tell me what's feminine about feminism."
And I thought, "Well that's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender, so there's nothing feminine about feminism."
But the more I thought about his question, the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism.
That is to say, there might be something, on average, different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.
So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state, it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept, what we would have is more of a concept of, not just how to protect, but how to care for each other.
And maybe that's where we need to go in the future, when we take democracy beyond anatomy, is to think less about the individual body, in terms of the identity, and think more about those relationships.
So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union, we're thinking about what we do for each other.
Thank you.

<title>Alice Dreger: Is anatomy destiny?</title>
<description>Alice Dreger works with people at the edge of anatomy, such as conjoined twins and intersexed people. In her observation, it's often a fuzzy line between male and female, among other anatomical distinctions. Which brings up a huge question: Why do we let our anatomy determine our fate? &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>
<keywords>culture,gender,politics</keywords>

College presidents are not the first people who come to mind when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination.
So I thought I'd start by telling you how I got here.
The story begins in the late '90s.
I was invited to meet with leading educators from the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia.
They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities.
Since education under the Soviet Union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology, they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women.
Given this rare opportunity to start fresh, they chose liberal arts as the most compelling model because of its historic commitment to furthering its students' broadest intellectual, and deepest ethical potential.
Having made that decision they came to the United States, home of liberal arts education, to talk with some of us most closely identified with that kind of education.
They spoke with a passion, an urgency, an intellectual conviction that, for me, was a voice I had not heard in decades, a dream long forgotten.
For, in truth, we had moved light years from the passions that animated them.
But for me, unlike them, in my world, the slate was not clean, and what was written on it was not encouraging.
In truth, liberal arts education no longer exists -- at least genuine liberal arts education -- in this country.
We have professionalized liberal arts to the point where they no longer provide the breadth of application and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement that is their signature.
Over the past century the expert has dethroned the educated generalist to become the sole model of intellectual accomplishment.
Expertise has for sure had its moments.
But the price of its dominance is enormous.
Subject matters are broken up into smaller and smaller pieces, with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure.
We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane.
You may think you know what is going on in that Jane Austen novel -- that is, until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism.
The progression of today's college student is to jettison every interest except one.
And within that one, to continually narrow the focus, learning more and more about less and less; this, despite the evidence all around us of the interconnectedness of things.
Lest you think I exaggerate, here are the beginnings of the A-B-Cs of anthropology.
As one moves up the ladder, values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion.
Questions such as, "What kind of a world are we making?
What kind of a world should we be making?
What kind of a world can we be making?"
are treated with more and more skepticism, and move off the table.
In so doing, the guardians of secular democracy in effect yield the connection between education and values to fundamentalists, who, you can be sure, have no compunctions about using education to further their values: the absolutes of a theocracy.
Meanwhile, the values and voices of democracy are silent.
Either we have lost touch with those values or, no better, believe they need not or cannot be taught.
This aversion to social values may seem at odds with the explosion of community service programs.
But despite the attention paid to these efforts, they remain emphatically extracurricular.
In effect, civic-mindedness is treated as outside the realm of what purports to be serious thinking and adult purposes.
Simply put, when the impulse is to change the world, the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness than to create a sense of empowerment.
This brew -- oversimplification of civic engagement, idealization of the expert, fragmentation of knowledge, emphasis on technical mastery, neutrality as a condition of academic integrity -- is toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections between education and the public good, between intellectual integrity and human freedom, which were at the heart -- -- of the challenge posed to and by my European colleagues.
When the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough, I can assure you, to give one pause, what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable.
Whether it was threats to the environment, inequities in the distribution of wealth, lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy with respect to the continuing uses of energy, we were in desperate straits.
And that was only the beginning.
The corrupting of our political life had become a living nightmare; nothing was exempt -- separation of powers, civil liberties, the rule of law, the relationship of church and state.
Accompanied by a squandering of the nation's material wealth that defied credulity.
A harrowing predilection for the uses of force had become commonplace, with an equal distaste for the alternative forms of influence.
At the same time, all of our firepower was impotent when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in Rwanda, Darfur, Myanmar.
Our public education, once a model for the world, has become most noteworthy for its failures.
Mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy eludes vast numbers of our students.
Despite having a research establishment that is the envy of the world, more than half of the American public don't believe in evolution.
And don't press your luck about how much those who do believe in it actually understand it.
Incredibly, this nation, with all its material, intellectual and spiritual resources, seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas.
Equally startling, from my point of view, is the fact that no one was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic, and what is happening in our leading educational institutions.
We may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth.
We are not even on the list when it comes to our responsibility for the health of this democracy.
We are playing with fire.
You can be sure Jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said, "If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects what never was, and never will be."
On a more personal note, this betrayal of our principles, our decency, our hope, to avoid the question, "What will I say, years from now, when people ask, 'Where were you?'" As president of a leading liberal arts college, famous for its innovative history, there were no excuses.
So the conversation began at Bennington.
Knowing that if we were to regain the integrity of liberal education, it would take radical rethinking of basic assumptions, beginning with our priorities.
Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective.
The accomplishment of civic virtue is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination at their most challenging.
Our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out to reflect the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century, and everyone has the responsibility for trying and participating in finding them.
Bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences in personal and professional objectives.
But the balances redressed, our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance.
When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.
The idea is to make the political-social challenges themselves -- from health and education to the uses of force -- the organizers of the curriculum.
They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines.
But structures designed to connect, rather than divide mutually dependent circles, rather than isolating triangles.
And the point is not to treat these topics as topics of study, but as frameworks of action.
The challenge: to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference.
Contrary to widely held assumptions, an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking.
The importance of coming to grips with values like justice, equity, truth, becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone cannot tell them what they need to know when the issue is rethinking education, our approach to health, or strategies for achieving an economics of equity.
The value of the past also comes alive; it provides a lot of company.
You are not the first to try to figure this out, just as you are unlikely to be the last.
Even more valuable, history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual, as well as the intended consequences of ideas.
In the language of my students, "Deep thought matters when you're contemplating what to do about things that matter."
A new liberal arts that can support this action-oriented curriculum has begun to emerge.
Rhetoric, the art of organizing the world of words to maximum effect.
Design, the art of organizing the world of things.
Mediation and improvisation also assume a special place in this new pantheon.
Quantitative reasoning attains its proper position at the heart of what it takes to manage change where measurement is crucial.
As is a capacity to discriminate systematically between what is at the core and what is at the periphery.
And when making connections is of the essence, the power of technology emerges with special intensity.
But so does the importance of content.
The more powerful our reach, the more important the question "About what?"
When improvisation, resourcefulness, imagination are key, artists, at long last, take their place at the table, when strategies of action are in the process of being designed.
In this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education where the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood, knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential.
Social activists, business leaders, lawyers, politicians, professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good.
Students, in turn, continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly.
And of course, this new wine needs new bottles if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism of this idea.
The most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to appreciate that the hard choices are not between good and evil, but between competing goods.
This discovery is transforming.
It undercuts self-righteousness, radically alters the tone and character of controversy, and enriches dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground.
Ideology, zealotry, unsubstantiated opinions simply won't do.
This is a political education, to be sure.
But it is a politics of principle, not of partisanship.
So the challenge for Bennington is to do it.
On the cover of Bennington's 2008 holiday card is the architect's sketch of a building opening in 2010 that is to be a center for the advancement of public action.
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment.
Think of it as a kind of secular church.
The words on the card describe what will happen inside.
We intend to turn the intellectual and imaginative power, passion and boldness of our students, faculty and staff to developing strategies for acting on the critical challenges of our time.
So we are doing our job.
While these past weeks have been a time of national exhilaration in this country, it would be tragic if you thought this meant your job was done.
The glacial silence we have experienced in the face of the shredding of the constitution, the unraveling of our public institutions, the deterioration of our infrastructure is not limited to the universities.
We the people have become inured to our own irrelevance when it comes to doing anything significant about anything that matters concerning governance, beyond waiting another four years.
We persist also in being sidelined by the idea of the expert as the only one capable of coming up with answers, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
The problem is there is no such thing as a viable democracy made up of experts, zealots, politicians and spectators.
People will continue and should continue to learn everything there is to know about something or other.
We actually do it all the time.
And there will be and should be those who spend a lifetime pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry.
But this single-mindedness will not yield the flexibilities of mind, the multiplicity of perspectives, the capacities for collaboration and innovation this country needs.
That is where you come in.
What is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here, needs to turn its attention to that collaborative, messy, frustrating, contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy.
President Obama and his team simply cannot do it alone.
If the question of where to start seems overwhelming you are at the beginning, not the end of this adventure.
Being overwhelmed is the first step if you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter, on a scale that makes a difference.
So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed?
Well, you have two things.
You have a mind. And you have other people.
Start with those, and change the world.

Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi.
Our desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes.
As we design these things, we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds, and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems.
Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes, and these creatures define who we are.
The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.
The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.
The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath, or not, and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch.
So, for example, when you touch a pencil, microbial exchange happens.
If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings, this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways.
I get asked all of the time from people, "Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?"
And I believe the answer is yes.
I think we're doing it right now, but we're doing it unconsciously.
I'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how, through both conscious and unconscious design, we're impacting these invisible worlds.
This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon, and I worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over 300 rooms in this building.
We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building, and to do this, we sampled dust.
From the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells, broke them open, and compared their gene sequences.
This means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project.
This is a picture of Tim, who, right when I snapped this picture, reminded me, he said, "Jessica, the last lab group I worked in I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest, and things have changed dramatically for me."
So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices, and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk.
The way that you look at this data is, first, look around the outside of the circle.
You'll see broad bacterial groups, and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe, it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.
So at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare.
Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building.
If you look inside the restrooms, they all have really similar ecosystems, and if you were to look inside the classrooms, those also have similar ecosystems.
But if you look across these space types, you can see that they're fundamentally different from one another.
I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.
I told Tim, "If you could just see the microbes, it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of."
And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland.
This perspective is a really powerful one for designers, because you can bring on principles of ecology, and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal, the way organisms move around.
We know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air.
So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system.
Mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable, that the air flow and temperature is just right.
They do this using principles of physics and chemistry, but they could also be using biology.
If you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building, you'll see that they're all very similar to one another.
And if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit, you'll see that they're fundamentally different.
The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago, and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to.
Another facet of how microbes get around is by people, and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people, or the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices.
Given that microbes travel around with people, you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes.
And that is exactly what we found.
If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another, they have very similar ecosystems, but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away, the ecosystem is fundamentally different.
And when I see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns, it makes me think that it's possible to tackle really challenging problems, like hospital-acquired infections.
I believe this has got to be, in part, a building ecology problem.
All right, I'm going to tell you one more story about this building.
I am collaborating with Charlie Brown.
He's an architect, and Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change.
He's dedicated his life to sustainable design.
When he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building, he got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did.
He went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health.
He helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated.
So what I'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building.
What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air, and how they vary over time.
Next I'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms.
We blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation.
A lot of buildings are operated this way, probably where you work, and companies do this to save money on their energy bill.
What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until Saturday, when we opened the vents up again.
When you walked into those rooms, they smelled really bad, and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before.
Contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers.
In these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well, and when Charlie saw this, he got really excited.
He felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape.
The examples that I just gave you are about architecture, but they're relevant to the design of anything.
Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone.
There's a new microbe, I just discovered it.
It's called BLIS, and it's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?
A conscious approach to design, I'm calling it bioinformed design, and I think it's possible.
Thank you.

If you had caught me straight out of college in the halls of the Vermont State House where I was a lobbyist in training and asked me what I was going to do with my life, I would have told you that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi, the Chinese equivalency exam, and I was going to go study law in Beijing, and I was going to improve U.S.-China relations through top-down policy changes and judicial system reforms.
I had a plan, and I never ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo.
Little did I know what a huge impact it would have on me one night when I was at a party and I heard a sound coming out of a record player in the corner of a room.
And it was Doc Watson singing and playing "Shady Grove."
Shady Grove, my little love Shady Grove, my darlin' Shady Grove, my little love Going back to Harlan That sound was just so beautiful, the sound of Doc's voice and the rippling groove of the banjo.
And after being totally and completely obsessed with the mammoth richness and history of Chinese culture, it was like this total relief to hear something so truly American and so truly awesome.
I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China.
So before going to law school in China I bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truck and I traveled down through Appalachia and I learned a bunch of old American songs, and I ended up in Kentucky at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention.
And I was sitting in a hallway one night and a couple girls came up to me.
And they said, "Hey, do you want to jam?"
And I was like, "Sure."
So I picked up my banjo and I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them.
And a record executive walked up to me and invited me to Nashville, Tennessee to make a record.
It's been eight years, and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer.
In fact, I went to Nashville.
And after a few months I was writing songs.
And the first song I wrote was in English, and the second one was in Chinese.
[Chinese] Outside your door the world is waiting.
Inside your heart a voice is calling.
The four corners of the world are watching, so travel daughter, travel.
Go get it, girl.
It's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky.
And I've played thousands of shows.
And I've collaborated with so many incredible, inspirational musicians around the world.
And I see the power of music.
I see the power of music to connect cultures.
I see it when I stand on a stage in a bluegrass festival in east Virginia and I look out at the sea of lawn chairs and I bust out into a song in Chinese.
[Chinese] And everybody's eyes just pop wide open like it's going to fall out of their heads.
And they're like, "What's that girl doing?"
And then they come up to me after the show and they all have a story.
They all come up and they're like, "You know, my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's chicken went to China and adopted a girl."
And I tell you what, it like everybody's got a story.
It's just incredible.
And then I go to China and I stand on a stage at a university and I bust out into a song in Chinese and everybody sings along and they roar with delight at this girl with the hair and the instrument, and she's singing their music.
And I see, even more importantly, the power of music to connect hearts.
Like the time I was in Sichuan Province and I was singing for kids in relocation schools in the earthquake disaster zone.
And this little girl comes up to me.
[Chinese] "Big sister Wong," Washburn, Wong, same difference.
"Big sister Wong, can I sing you a song that my mom sang for me before she was swallowed in the earthquake?"
And I sat down, she sat on my lap.
She started singing her song.
And the warmth of her body and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks, and I started to cry.
And the light that shone off of her eyes was a place I could have stayed forever.
And in that moment, we weren't our American selves, we weren't our Chinese selves, we were just mortals sitting together in that light that keeps us here.
I want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone.
And I know U.S.-China relations doesn't need another lawyer.
Thank you.

I'm speaking to you about what I call the "mesh."
It's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives.
And it's starting to look at -- not always and not for everything -- but in certain moments of time, access to certain kinds of goods and service will trump ownership of them.
And so it's the pursuit of better things, easily shared.
And we come from a long tradition of sharing.
We've shared transportation.
We've shared wine and food and other sorts of fabulous experiences in coffee bars in Amsterdam.
We've also shared other sorts of entertainment -- sports arenas, public parks, concert halls, libraries, universities.
All these things are share-platforms, but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what I refer to as the "mother of all share-platforms."
And as I think about the mesh and I think about, well, what's driving it, how come it's happening now, I think there's a number of vectors that I want to give you as background.
One is the recession -- that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value -- so starting to align the value with the true cost.
Secondly, population growth and density into cities.
More people, smaller spaces, less stuff.
Climate change: we're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet.
Also, there's been this recent distrust of big brands, global big brands, in a bunch of different industries, and that's created an opening.
Research is showing here, in the States, and in Canada and Western Europe, that most of us are much more open to local companies, or brands that maybe we haven't heard of.
Whereas before, we went with the big brands that we were sure we trusted.
And last is that we're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before -- except for if you're sitting next to someone.
The other thing that's worth considering is that we've made a huge investment over decades and decades, and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance.
It's a physical infrastructure that allows us to get from point A to point B and move things that way.
It's also -- Web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems, and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance.
It allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways.
And so for me, a mesh company, the "classic" mesh company, brings together these three things: our ability to connect to each other -- most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled -- allows us to find each other and find things in time and space.
And third is that physical things are readable on a map -- so restaurants, a variety of venues, but also with GPS and other technology like RFID and it continues to expand beyond that, we can also track things that are moving, like a car, a taxicab, a transit system, a box that's moving through time and space.
And so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them.
For example, I want to use Zipcar.
How many people here have experienced car-sharing or bike-sharing?
Wow, that's great. Okay, thank you.
Basically Zipcar is the largest car-sharing company in the world.
They did not invent car-sharing.
Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe.
One of the founders went to Switzerland, saw it implemented someplace, said, "Wow, that looks really cool.
I think we can do that in Cambridge," brought it to Cambridge and they started -- two women -- Robin Chase being the other person who started it.
Zipcar got some really important things right.
First, they really understood that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.
And so they were very clever about the way that they packaged car-sharing.
They made it sexy. They made it fresh.
They made it aspirational.
If you were a member of the club, when you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster.
The cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars that were hollowed out or something.
They picked these sexy cars.
They targeted to universities.
They made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching.
It was a very nice experience, and the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.
And so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right.
But they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company.
They understand that they are an information company.
Because when we buy a car we go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow -- usually as quickly as possible.
But when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service, you might use an E.V. to commute, you get a truck because you're doing a home project.
When you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan.
And you're going to the mountains to ski, you get different accessories put on the car for doing that sort of thing.
Meanwhile, these guys are sitting back, collecting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service.
And so it's not only an option for them, but I believe it's an imperative for Zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us, to be like a concierge service.
Because we give them so much information, and they are entitled to really see how it is that we're moving.
They're in really good shape to anticipate what we're going to want next.
And so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car?
What percentage of the time?
Any guesses?
Those are really very good.
I was imagining it was like 20 percent when I first started.
The number across the U.S. and Western Europe is eight percent.
And so basically even if you think it's 10 percent, 90 percent of the time, something that costs us a lot of money -- personally, and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things -- 90 percent of the time it's sitting around.
So for this reason, I think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that, if we squeeze hard on things that we've thrown away, there's a lot of value in those things.
What set up with Zipcar -- Zipcar started in 2000.
In the last year, 2010, two car companies started, one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar, and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.
They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services, because the two things that really work for car-sharing is, one, the car has to be available, and two, it's within one or two blocks of where you stand.
Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor's car, and it's probably also available.
So people have created this business.
Zipcar started a decade earlier, in 2000.
It took them six years to get 1,000 cars in service.
WhipCar, which started April of last year, it took them six months to get 1,000 cars in the service.
So, really interesting.
People are making anywhere between 200 and 700 dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it.
So it's like vacation rentals for cars.
Since I'm here -- and I hope some people in the audience are in the car business -- -- I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things -- we saw cable-ready TVs and WiFi-ready Notebooks -- it would be really great if, any minute now, you guys could start rolling share-ready cars off.
Because it just creates more flexibility.
It allows us as owners to have other options.
And I think we're going there anyway.
The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses -- and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix that are full mesh businesses, or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies, car manufacturers, who are beginning to offer their own car-share services as well as a second flanker brand, or as really a test, I think -- is to make sharing irresistible.
We have experiences in our lives, certainly, when sharing has been irresistible.
It's just, how do we make that recurrent and scale it?
We know also, because we're connected in social networks, that it's easy to create delight in one little place.
It's contagious because we're all connected to each other.
So if I have a terrific experience and I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels.
The opposite, as we know, is also true, often more true.
So here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A., doing the things that gourmet food trucks do, and they've gathered quite a following.
In general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur, I look at things as platforms.
Platforms are invitations.
So creating Craigslist or iTunes and the iPhone developer network, there are all these networks -- Facebook as well.
These platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of people to come with their ideas and their opportunity to create and target an application for a particular audience.
And honestly, it's full of surprises.
Because I don't think any of us in this room could have predicted the sorts of applications that have happened at Facebook, around Facebook, for example, two years ago, when Mark announced that they were going to go with a platform.
So in this way, I think that cities are platforms, and certainly Detroit is a platform.
The invitation of bringing makers and artists and entrepreneurs -- it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity and helps a city to thrive.
It's inviting participation, and cities have, historically, invited all sorts of participation.
Now we're saying that there's other options as well.
So, for example, city departments can open up transit data.
Google has made available transit data API.
And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.
that have provided the transit data, and different developers are building applications.
So I was having a coffee in Portland, and half-of-a-latte in and the little board in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in 16 minutes.
And so it's reliable, real data that's right in my face, where I am, so I can finish the latte.
There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now: about 21 percent of vacant commercial and industrial space.
That space is not vital.
The areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement.
There's this thing -- how many people here have heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?
Oh, great. So I'm a big fan of this.
And this is a very mesh-y thing.
Essentially, there are all sorts of restaurants in Oakland, near where I live.
There's a pop-up general store every three weeks, and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for foodies.
Super fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood.
Subsequent to that, after it's been going for about a year now, they actually started to lease and create and extend.
An area that was edgy-artsy is now starting to become much cooler and engage a lot more people.
So this is an example.
The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts, and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London.
But these sorts of things are happening in many different environments.
From my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do is create perishability and urgency.
It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson: sold out.
And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention is a wonderful thing.
So a lot of what we see in the mesh, and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define, refine and scale.
It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur, to go to market, to be in conversation with people, listen, refine something and go back.
It's very cost-effective, and it's very mesh-y.
The infrastructure enables that.
In closing, and as we're moving towards the end, I just also want to encourage -- and I'm willing to share my failures as well, though not from the stage.
I would just like to say that one of the big things, when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other, but also move to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation, is by sharing failures.
And one quick example is Velib, in 2007, came forward in Paris with a very bold proposition, a very big bike-sharing service.
They made a lot of mistakes.
They had some number of big successes.
But they were very transparent, or they had to be, in the way that they exposed what worked and didn't work.
And so B.C. in Barcelona and B-cycle and Boris Bikes in London -- no one has had to repeat the version 1.0 screw-ups and expensive learning exercises that happened in Paris.
So the opportunity when we're connected is also to share failures and successes.
We're at the very beginning of something that, what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward, is inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early.
I have a website -- it's a directory -- and it started with about 1,200 companies, and in the last two-and-a-half months it's up to about 3,300 companies.
And it grows on a very regular daily basis.
But it's very much at the beginning.
So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride.
And thank you very much.

I and my colleagues Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others, have put 37 people who are madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner.
17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped, and we're just starting our third experiment: studying people who report that they're still in love after 10 to 25 years of marriage.
So, this is the short story of that research.
In the jungles of Guatemala, in Tikal, stands a temple.
It was built by the grandest Sun King, of the grandest city-state, of the grandest civilization of the Americas, the Mayas.
His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil.
He stood over six feet tall.
He lived into his 80s, and he was buried beneath this monument in 720 AD.
And Mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife.
So, he built a temple in her honor, facing his.
And every spring and autumn, exactly at the equinox, the sun rises behind his temple, and perfectly bathes her temple with his shadow.
And as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon, it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow.
After 1,300 years, these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb.
Around the world, people love.
They sing for love, they dance for love, they compose poems and stories about love.
They tell myths and legends about love.
They pine for love, they live for love, they kill for love, and they die for love.
As Walt Whitman once said, he said, "Oh, I would stake all for you."
Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies.
They've never found a society that did not have it.
But love isn't always a happy experience.
In one study of college students, they asked a lot of questions about love, but the two that stood out to me the most were, "Have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved?"
And the second question was, "Have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you?"
And almost 95 percent of both men and women said yes to both.
Almost nobody gets out of love alive.
So, before I start telling you about the brain, I want to read for you what I think is the most powerful love poem on Earth.
There's other love poems that are, of course, just as good, but I don't think this one can be surpassed.
It was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska to a missionary in 1896, and here it is.
I've never had the opportunity to say it before.
"Fire runs through my body with the pain of loving you.
Pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you.
Pain like a boil about to burst with my love for you, consumed by fire with my love for you.
I remember what you said to me.
I am thinking of your love for me.
I am torn by your love for me.
Pain and more pain -- where are you going with my love?
I am told you will go from here.
I am told you will leave me here.
My body is numb with grief.
Remember what I said, my love.
Goodbye, my love, goodbye."
Emily Dickinson once wrote, "Parting is all we need to know of hell."
How many people have suffered in all the millions of years of human evolution?
How many people around the world are dancing with elation at this very minute?
Romantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth.
So, several years ago, I decided to look into the brain and study this madness.
Our first study of people who were happily in love has been widely publicized, so I'm only going to say a very little about it.
We found activity in a tiny, little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area.
We found activity in some cells called the A10 cells, cells that actually make dopamine, a natural stimulant, and spray it to many brain regions.
Indeed, this part, the VTA, is part of the brain's reward system.
It's way below your cognitive thinking process.
It's below your emotions.
It's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain, associated with wanting, with motivation, with focus and with craving.
In fact, the same brain region where we found activity becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine.
But romantic love is much more than a cocaine high -- at least you come down from cocaine.
Romantic love is an obsession. It possesses you.
You lose your sense of self.
You can't stop thinking about another human being.
Somebody is camping in your head.
As an eighth-century Japanese poet said, "My longing had no time when it ceases."
Wild is love.
And the obsession can get worse when you've been rejected.
So, right now, Lucy Brown and I, the neuroscientist on our project, are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped.
It was very difficult actually, putting these people in the machine, because they were in such bad shape.
So anyway, we found activity in three brain regions.
We found activity in the brain region, in exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love.
What a bad deal.
You know, when you've been dumped, the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being, and then go on with your life -- but no, you just love them harder.
As the poet Terence, the Roman poet once said, he said, "The less my hope, the hotter my love."
And indeed, we now know why.
Two thousand years later, we can explain this in the brain.
That brain system -- the reward system for wanting, for motivation, for craving, for focus -- becomes more active when you can't get what you want.
In this case, life's greatest prize: an appropriate mating partner.
We found activity in other brain regions also -- in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses.
You know, you're lying there, you're looking at the picture, and you're in this machine, and you're calculating, you know, what went wrong.
How, you know, what have I lost?
As a matter of fact, Lucy and I have a little joke about this.
It comes from a David Mamet play, and there's two con artists in the play, and the woman is conning the man, and the man looks at the woman and says, "Oh, you're a bad pony, I'm not going to bet on you."
And indeed, it's this part of the brain, the core of the nucleus accumbens, actually, that is becoming active as you're measuring your gains and losses.
It's also the brain region that becomes active when you're willing to take enormous risks for huge gains and huge losses.
Last but not least, we found activity in a brain region associated with deep attachment to another individual.
No wonder people suffer around the world, and we have so many crimes of passion.
When you've been rejected in love, not only are you engulfed with feelings of romantic love, but you're feeling deep attachment to this individual.
Moreover, this brain circuit for reward is working, and you're feeling intense energy, intense focus, intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all to win life's greatest prize.
So, what have I learned from this experiment that I would like to tell the world?
Foremost, I have come to think that romantic love is a drive, a basic mating drive.
Not the sex drive -- the sex drive gets you out there, looking for a whole range of partners.
Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on just one at a time, conserve your mating energy, and start the mating process with this single individual.
I think of all the poetry that I've read about romantic love, what sums it up best is something that is said by Plato, over 2,000 years ago.
He said, "The god of love lives in a state of need.
It is a need. It is an urge.
It is a homeostatic imbalance.
Like hunger and thirst, it's almost impossible to stamp out."
I've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction: a perfectly wonderful addiction when it's going well, and a perfectly horrible addiction when it's going poorly.
And indeed, it has all of the characteristics of addiction.
You focus on the person, you obsessively think about them, you crave them, you distort reality, your willingness to take enormous risks to win this person.
And it's got the three main characteristics of addiction: tolerance, you need to see them more, and more, and more; withdrawals; and last, relapse.
I've got a girlfriend who's just getting over a terrible love affair.
It's been about eight months, she's beginning to feel better.
And she was driving along in her car the other day, and suddenly she heard a song on the car radio that reminded her of this man.
And she -- not only did the instant craving come back, but she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry.
So, one thing I would like the medical community, and the legal community, and even the college community, to see if they can understand, that indeed, romantic love is one of the most addictive substances on Earth.
I would also like to tell the world that animals love.
There's not an animal on this planet that will copulate with anything that comes along.
Too old, too young, too scruffy, too stupid, and they won't do it.
Unless you're stuck in a laboratory cage -- and you know, if you spend your entire life in a little box, you're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with -- but I've looked in a hundred species, and everywhere in the wild, animals have favorites.
As a matter of fact ethologists know this.
There are over eight words for what they call "animal favoritism:" selective proceptivity, mate choice, female choice, sexual choice.
And indeed, there are now three academic articles in which they've looked at this attraction, which may only last for a second, but it's a definite attraction, and either this same brain region, this reward system, or the chemicals of that reward system are involved.
In fact, I think animal attraction can be instant -- you can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant.
And I think that this is really the origin of what you and I call "love at first sight."
People have often asked me whether what I know about love has spoiled it for me.
And I just simply say, "Hardly."
You can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake, and then when you sit down and eat that cake, you can still feel that joy.
And certainly, I make all the same mistakes that everybody else does too, but it's really deepened my understanding and compassion, really, for all human life.
As a matter of fact, in New York, I often catch myself looking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the tot.
And in fact, sometimes I feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate, when I think of how intense this brain system is.
Our newest experiment has been hatched by my colleague, Art Aron -- putting people who are reporting that they are still in love, in a long-term relationship, into the functional MRI.
We've put five people in so far, and indeed, we found exactly the same thing. They're not lying.
The brain areas associated with intense romantic love still become active, 25 years later.
There are still many questions to be answered and asked about romantic love.
The question that I'm working on right this minute -- and I'm only going to say it for a second, and then end -- is, why do you fall in love with one person, rather than another?
I never would have even thought to think of this, but Match.com, the Internet-dating site, came to me three years ago and asked me that question.
And I said, I don't know.
I know what happens in the brain, when you do become in love, but I don't know why you fall in love with one person rather than another.
And so, I've spent the last three years on this.
And there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another, that psychologists can tell you.
And we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background, the same general level of intelligence, the same general level of good looks, the same religious values.
Your childhood certainly plays a role, but nobody knows how.
And that's about it, that's all they know.
No, they've never found the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship.
So, it began to occur to me that maybe your biology pulls you towards some people rather than another.
And I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree you express dopamine, serotonin, estrogen and testosterone.
I think we've evolved four very broad personality types associated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain.
And on this dating site that I have created, called Chemistry.com, I ask you first a series of questions to see to what degree you express these chemicals, and I'm watching who chooses who to love.
And 3.7 million people have taken the questionnaire in America.
About 600,000 people have taken it in 33 other countries.
I'm putting the data together now, and at some point -- there will always be magic to love, but I think I will come closer to understanding why it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background, your same general level of intelligence, your same general level of good looks, and you don't feel pulled towards all of them.
I think there's biology to that.
I think we're going to end up, in the next few years, to understand all kinds of brain mechanisms that pull us to one person rather than another.
So, I will close with this. These are my older people.
Faulkner once said, "The past is not dead, it's not even the past."
Indeed, we carry a lot of luggage from our yesteryear in the human brain.
And so, there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature, and this reminds me of it.
These are two women.
Women tend to get intimacy differently than men do.
Women get intimacy from face-to-face talking.
We swivel towards each other, we do what we call the "anchoring gaze" and we talk.
This is intimacy to women.
I think it comes from millions of years of holding that baby in front of your face, cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.
Men tend to get intimacy from side-by-side doing.
As soon as one guy looks up, the other guy will look away.
I think it comes from millions of years of standing behind that -- sitting behind the bush, looking straight ahead, trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock.
I think, for millions of years, men faced their enemies, they sat side by side with friends.
So my final statement is: love is in us.
It's deeply embedded in the brain.
Our challenge is to understand each other. Thank you.

<title>Helen Fisher: The brain in love</title>
<description>Why do we crave love so much, even to the point that we would die for it? To learn more about our very real, very physical need for romantic love, Helen Fisher and her research team took MRIs of people in love -- and people who had just been dumped.</description>

Well, now we're going to the Bahamas to meet a remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with in the wild for the last 28 years.
Now I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains and what they might be doing with all that brainpower in the wild.
And we know they use some of that brainpower for just living complicated lives, but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence?
Well, we know a few things.
We know that their brain-to-body ratio, which is a physical measure of intelligence, is second only to humans.
Cognitively, they can understand artificially-created languages.
And they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors.
And in some parts of the world, they use tools, like sponges to hunt fish.
But there's one big question left: do they have a language, and if so, what are they talking about?
So decades ago, not years ago, I set out to find a place in the world where I could observe dolphins underwater to try to crack the code of their communication system.
Now in most parts of the world, the water's pretty murky, so it's very hard to observe animals underwater, but I found a community of dolphins that live in these beautiful, clear, shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas which are just east of Florida.
And they spend their daytime resting and socializing in the safety of the shallows, but at night, they go off the edge and hunt in deep water.
Now, it's not a bad place to be a researcher, either.
So we go out for about five months every summer in a 20-meter catamaran, and we live, sleep and work at sea for weeks at a time.
My main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone, which is an underwater microphone, and this is so I can correlate sound and behavior.
And most of our work's pretty non-invasive.
We try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water, since we're actually observing them physically in the water.
Now, Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species to work with for a couple of reasons.
They're born without spots, and they get spots with age, and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases, so that's fun to track their behavior.
And by about the age of 15, they're fully spotted black and white.
Now the mother you see here is Mugsy.
She's 35 years old in this shot, but dolphins can actually live into their early 50s.
And like all the dolphins in our community, we photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots and nicks in her dorsal fin, and also the unique spot patterns as she matured over time.
Now, young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up, and they use their teenage years to practice social skills, and at about the age of nine, the females become sexually mature, so they can get pregnant, and the males mature quite a bit later, at around 15 years of age.
And dolphins are very promiscuous, and so we have to determine who the fathers are, so we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material out of the water and extracting DNA.
So what that means is, after 28 years, we are tracking three generations, including grandmothers and grandfathers.
Now, dolphins are natural acousticians.
They make sounds 10 times as high and hear sounds 10 times as high as we do.
But they have other communication signals they use.
They have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate.
They have taste, not smell.
And they have touch.
And sound can actually be felt in the water, because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same.
So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance.
Now, we do know some things about how sounds are used with certain behaviors.
Now, the signature whistle is a whistle that's specific to an individual dolphin, and it's like a name.
And this is the best-studied sound, because it's easy to measure, really, and you'd find this whistle when mothers and calves are reuniting, for example.
Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks.
This is the dolphin's sonar.
And they use these clicks to hunt and feed.
But they can also tightly pack these clicks together into buzzes and use them socially.
For example, males will stimulate a female during a courtship chase.
You know, I've been buzzed in the water.
Don't tell anyone. It's a secret.
And you can really feel the sound. That was my point with that.
So dolphins are also political animals, so they have to resolve conflicts.
And they use these burst-pulsed sounds as well as their head-to-head behaviors when they're fighting.
And these are very unstudied sounds because they're hard to measure.
Now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight.
So you're going to see two groups, and you're going to see the head-to-head posturing, some open mouths, lots of squawking.
There's a bubble.
And basically, one of these groups will kind of back off and everything will resolve fine, and it doesn't really escalate into violence too much.
Now, in the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose that interact socially with the spotted dolphins.
For example, they babysit each other's calves.
The males have dominance displays that they use when they're chasing each other's females.
And the two species actually form temporary alliances when they're chasing sharks away.
And one of the mechanisms they use to communicate their coordination is synchrony.
They synchronize their sounds and their body postures to look bigger and sound stronger.
Now, these are bottlenose dolphins, and you'll see them starting to synchronize their behavior and their sounds.
You see, they're synchronizing with their partner as well as the other dyad.
I wish I was that coordinated.
Now, it's important to remember that you're only hearing the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds, and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds, and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds.
Now, researchers have actually measured whistle complexity using information theory, and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages.
But burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery.
Now, these are three spectragrams.
Two are human words, and one is a dolphin vocalizing.
So just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin.
Now, it turns out burst-pulsed sounds actually look a bit like human phonemes.
Now, one way to crack the code is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean, but it's a difficult job, and we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet.
But a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology, an interface to do two-way communication, and that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas and in real time.
Now, scientists have used keyboard interfaces to try to bridge the gap with species including chimpanzees and dolphins.
This underwater keyboard in Orlando, Florida, at the Epcot Center, was actually the most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water and exchange information.
So we wanted to develop an interface like this in the Bahamas, but in a more natural setting.
And one of the reasons we thought we could do this is because the dolphins were starting to show us a lot of mutual curiosity.
They were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations and our postures, and they were also inviting us into dolphin games.
Now, dolphins are social mammals, so they love to play, and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed, or sargassum in this case, around.
And they're very adept. They like to drag it and drop it from appendage to appendage.
Now in this footage, the adult is Caroh.
She's 25 years old here, and this is her newborn, Cobalt, and he's just learning how to play this game.
She's kind of teasing him and taunting him.
He really wants that sargassum.
Now, when dolphins solicit humans for this game, they'll often sink vertically in the water, and they'll have a little sargassum on their flipper, and they'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes on the bottom and let us go get it, and then we'll have a little seaweed keep away game.
But when we don't dive down and get it, they'll bring it to the surface and they'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail and drop it for us like they do their calves, and then we'll pick it up and have a game.
And so we started thinking, well, wouldn't it be neat to build some technology that would allow the dolphins to request these things in real time, their favorite toys?
So the original vision was to have a keyboard hanging from the boat attached to a computer, and the divers and dolphins would activate the keys on the keypad and happily exchange information and request toys from each other.
But we quickly found out that dolphins simply were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard.
They've got better things to do in the wild.
They might do it in captivity, but in the wild -- So we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water, and we labeled four objects they like to play with, the scarf, rope, sargassum, and also had a bow ride, which is a fun activity for a dolphin.
And that's the scarf whistle, which is also associated with a visual symbol.
And these are artificially created whistles.
They're outside the dolphin's normal repertoire, but they're easily mimicked by the dolphins.
And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour, working out in the field with this keyboard using it with each other to do requests for toys while the dolphins were watching.
And the dolphins could get in on the game.
They could point at the visual object, or they could mimic the whistle.
Now this is video of a session.
The diver here has a rope toy, and I'm on the keyboard on the left, and I've just played the rope key, and that's the request for the toy from the human.
So I've got the rope, I'm diving down, and I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention, because they're kind of like little kids.
You have to keep their attention.
I'm going to drop the rope, see if they come over.
Here they come, and then they're going to pick up the rope and drag it around as a toy.
Now, I'm at the keyboard on the left, and this is actually the first time that we tried this.
I'm going to try to request this toy, the rope toy, from the dolphins using the rope sound.
Let's see if they might actually understand what that means.
That's the rope whistle.
Up come the dolphins, and drop off the rope, yay. Wow.
So this is only once.
We don't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles.
Okay, so here's a second toy in the water.
This is a scarf toy, and I'm trying to lead the dolphin over to the keyboard to show her the visual and the acoustic signal.
Now this dolphin, we call her "the scarf thief," because over the years she's absconded with about 12 scarves.
In fact, we think she has a boutique somewhere in the Bahamas.
So I'm reaching over. She's got the scarf on her right side.
And we try to not touch the animals too much, we really don't want to over-habituate them.
And I'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard.
And the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound to request the scarf.
So I try to give her the scarf.
Whoop. Almost lost it.
But this is the moment where everything becomes possible.
The dolphin's at the keyboard.
You've got full attention.
And this sometimes went on for hours.
And I wanted to share this video with you not to show you any big breakthroughs, because they haven't happened yet, but to show you the level of intention and focus that these dolphins have, and interest in the system.
And because of this, we really decided we needed some more sophisticated technology.
So we joined forces with Georgia Tech, with Thad Starner's wearable computing group, to build us an underwater wearable computer that we're calling CHAT. [CHAT: Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry] Now, instead of pushing a keyboard through the water, the diver's wearing the complete system, and it's acoustic only, so basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad on the forearm, the sounds go out through an underwater speaker, if a dolphin mimics the whistle or a human plays the whistle, the sounds come in and are localized by two hydrophones.
The computer can localize who requested the toy if there's a word match.
And the real power of the system is in the real-time sound recognition, so we can respond to the dolphins quickly and accurately.
And we're at prototype stage, but this is how we hope it will play out.
So Diver A and Diver B both have a wearable computer and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle, the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water, but also as a word through bone conduction.
So Diver A plays the scarf whistle or Diver B plays the sargassum whistle to request a toy from whoever has it.
What we hope will happen is that the dolphin mimics the whistle, and if Diver A has the sargassum, if that's the sound that was played and requested, then the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin and they'll swim away happily into the sunset playing sargassum for forever.
Now, how far can this kind of communication go?
Well, CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins to request things from us.
It's designed to really be two-way.
Now, will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally?
We hope so and we think so.
But as we decode their natural sounds, we're also planning to put those back into the computerized system.
For example, right now we can put their own signature whistles in the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin.
Likewise, we can create our own whistles, our own whistle names, and let the dolphins request specific divers to interact with.
Now it may be that all our mobile technology will actually be the same technology that helps us communicate with another species down the road.
In the case of a dolphin, you know, it's a species that, well, they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways and we might not be able to admit that right now, but they live in quite a different environment, and you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems.
I mean, imagine what it would be like to really understand the mind of another intelligent species on the planet.
Thank you.

Living in Africa is to be on the edge, metaphorically, and quite literally when you think about connectivity before 2008.
Though many human intellectual and technological leaps had happened in Europe and the rest of the world, but Africa was sort of cut off.
And that changed, first with ships when we had the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution and also the Industrial Revolution.
And now we've got the digital revolution.
These revolutions have not been evenly distributed across continents and nations.
Never have been.
Now, this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables that connect Africa to the rest of the world.
What I find amazing is that Africa is transcending its geography problem.
Africa is connecting to the rest of the world and within itself.
The connectivity situation has improved greatly, but some barriers remain.
It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be.
In 2008, one of the problems that we faced was lack of information flow.
There was a media blackout in 2008, when there was post-election violence in Kenya.
It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time.
So we came together and we created software called Ushahidi.
And Ushahidi means "testimony" or "witness" in Swahili.
I'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators.
This is David and Erik.
I call them brothers from another mother.
Clearly I have a German mother somewhere.
And we worked together first with building and growing Ushahidi.
And the idea of the software was to gather information from SMS, email and web, and put a map so that you could see what was happening where, and you could visualize that data.
And after that initial prototype, we set out to make free and open-source software so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did.
All the while, we also wanted to give back to the local tech community that helped us grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days.
And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi, an actual physical space where we could collaborate, and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya.
We did that with the support of different organizations like the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network.
And we were able to grow this software footprint, and a few years later it became very useful software, and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti where citizens could indicate where they are and what their needs were, and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis and the tsunami in Japan.
Now, this year the Internet turns 20, and Ushahidi turned five.
Ushahidi is not only the software that we made.
It is the team, and it's also the community that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee.
We did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world.
There are crisis maps, election maps, corruption maps, and even environmental monitoring crowd maps.
We are humbled that this has roots in Kenya and that it has some use to people around the world trying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with.
There is more that we're doing to explore this idea of collective intelligence, that I, as a citizen, if I share the information with whatever device that I have, could inform you about what is going on, and that if you do the same, we can have a bigger picture of what's going on.
I moved back to Kenya in 2011.
Erik moved in 2010.
Very different reality. I used to live in Chicago where there was abundant Internet access.
I had never had to deal with a blackout.
And in Kenya, it's a very different reality, and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress and the digital revolution is the electricity problem.
The day-to-day frustrations of dealing with this can be, let's just say very annoying.
Blackouts are not fun.
Imagine sitting down to start working, and all of a sudden the power goes out, your Internet connection goes down with it, so you have to figure out, okay, now, where's the modem, how do I switch back?
And then, guess what? You have to deal with it again.
Now, this is the reality of Kenya, where we live now, and other parts of Africa.
The other problem that we're facing is that communication costs are also still a challenge.
It costs me five Kenyan shillings, or .06 USD to call the U.S., Canada or China.
Guess how much it costs to call Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria?
Thirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the cost to connect within Africa.
And also, when traveling within Africa, you've got different settings for different mobile providers.
This is the reality that we deal with.
So we've got a joke in Ushahidi where we say, "If it works in Africa, it'll work anywhere."
[Most use technology to define the function. We use function to drive the technology.] What if we could overcome the problem of unreliable Internet and electricity and reduce the cost of connection?
Could we leverage the cloud?
We've built a crowd map, we've built Ushahidi.
Could we leverage these technologies to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country?
So we looked at the modem, an important part of the infrastructure of the Internet, and asked ourselves why the modems that we are using right now are built for a different context, where you've got ubiquitous internet, you've got ubiquitous electricity, yet we sit here in Nairobi and we do not have that luxury.
We wanted to redesign the modem for the developing world, for our context, and for our reality.
What if we could have connectivity with less friction?
This is the BRCK.
It acts as a backup to the Internet so that, when the power goes out, it fails over and connects to the nearest GSM network.
Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive.
It's actually everywhere.
Most towns at least have a 3G connection.
So why don't we leverage that? And that's why we built this.
The other reason that we built this is when electricity goes down, this has eight hours of battery left, so you can continue working, you can continue being productive, and let's just say you are less stressed.
And for rural areas, it can be the primary means of connection.
The software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play when we wondered how can we use the cloud to be more intelligent so that you can analyze the different networks, and whenever you switch on the backup, you pick on the fastest network, so we'll have multi-SIM capability so that you can put multiple SIMs, and if one network is faster, that's the one you hop on, and if the up time on that is not very good, then you hop onto the next one.
The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere.
With load balancing, this can be possible.
The other interesting thing for us -- we like sensors -- is this idea that you could have an on-ramp for the Internet of things.
Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this.
It's built in a modular way so that you can also attach a satellite module so that you could have Internet connectivity even in very remote areas.
Out of adversity can come innovation, and how can we help the ambitious coders and makers in Kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure?
And for us, we begin with solving the problem in our own backyard in Kenya.
It is not without challenge.
Our team has basically been mules carrying components from the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations with customs border agents.
"What are you carrying?"
And the local financing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects.
So we put it on Kickstarter, and I'm happy to say that, through the support of many people, not only here but online, the BRCK has been Kickstarted, and now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins.
I will close by saying that, if we solve this for the local market, it could be impactful not only for the coders in Nairobi but also for small business owners who need reliable connectivity, and it can reduce the cost of connecting, and hopefully collaboration within African countries.
The idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy are connectivity and entrepreneurship.
The BRCK is our part to keep Africans connected, and to help them drive the global digital revolution.
Thank you.

<title>Juliana Rotich: Meet BRCK, Internet access built for Africa</title>
<description>Tech communities are booming all over Africa, says Nairobi-based Juliana Rotich, cofounder of the open-source software Ushahidi. But it remains challenging to get and stay connected in a region with frequent blackouts and spotty Internet hookups. So Rotich and friends developed BRCK, offering resilient connectivity for the developing world.</description>

I was one of those kids that, every time I got in the car, I basically had to roll down the window.
It was usually too hot, too stuffy or just too smelly, and my father would not let us use the air conditioner.
He said that it would overheat the engine.
And you might remember, some of you, how the cars were back then, and it was a common problem of overheating.
But it was also the signal that capped the use, or overuse, of energy-consuming devices.
Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country.
We blast the air conditioning the entire way, and we never experience overheating.
So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop.
Great, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings.
In the past, before air conditioning, we had thick walls.
The thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interior very cool during the summertime, and warm during the wintertime, and the small windows were also very good because it limited the amount of temperature transfer between the interior and exterior.
Then in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass, rolled steel and mass production, we were able to make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views, and with that came the irreversible reliance on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces.
Over time, the buildings got taller and bigger, our engineering even better, so that the mechanical systems were massive. They require a huge amount of energy.
They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere, and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities, where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas, but we also have problems that, when we lose power, we can't open a window here, and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again.
Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net-zero energy state, we can't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient.
We need to look for something else, and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut.
So what do we do here? How do we pull ourselves and dig us out of this hole that we've dug?
If we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know, I was a biology major before I went into architecture, the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing.
That's the first line of defense for the body.
It has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things that work together very dynamically and very efficiently, and so what I propose is that our building skins should be more similar to human skin, and by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsive and differentiated, depending on where it is.
And this gets me back to my research.
What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.
I presently, or currently, work with smart materials, and a smart thermo-bimetal.
First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy, and that's a very big deal for architecture.
What it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together.
You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.
And because it has two different coefficients of expansion, when heated, one side will expand faster than the other and result in a curling action.
So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system, and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen when also heated, and currently have this installation at the Materials &amp; Applications gallery in Silver Lake, close by, and it's there until August, if you want to see it.
It's called "Bloom," and the surface is made completely out of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things. One, it's a sun-shading device, so that when the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through, and in other areas, it's a ventilating system, so that hot, trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary.
You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun, as it moves across the surface, as well as the shade, each of the tiles moves individually.
Keep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today, this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different.
And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate each one to be very, very specific to its location, to the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls.
So this kind of proof of concept project has a lot of implications to actual future application in architecture, and in this case, here you see a house, that's for a developer in China, and it's actually a four-story glass box.
It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access, but now it's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer, it's a screen that goes around it, and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface.
In addition to that, it can also screen areas for privacy, so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas in the space during different times of day.
And what it basically implies is that, in houses now, we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things, as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building.
I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market, and so here you see a pretty typical double-glazed window panel, and in that panel, between those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing, I'm trying to work on making a thermo-bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetal will begin to curl, and what actually will happen then is it'll start to block out the sun in certain areas of the building, and totally, if necessary.
And so you can imagine, even in this application, that in a high-rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to 30, 40 floors, the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface.
And these are some later studies that I'm working on right now that are on the boards, where you can see, in the bottom right-hand corner, with the red, it's actually smaller pieces of thermometal, and it's actually going to, This last project is also of components.
The influence -- and if you have noticed, one of my spheres of influence is biology -- is from a grasshopper.
And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system.
They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles, and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down, and so in this project, I'm trying to look at how we can consider that in architecture too, how we can bring air through holes in the sides of a building.
And so you see here some early studies of blocks, where those holes are actually coming through, and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied, and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little hard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows.
On the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks, and on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through, so those are two different components that I'm working on, and again, it's a completely different thing, because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows.
So I want to leave you with one last impression about the project, or this kind of work and using smart materials.
When you're tired of opening and closing those blinds day after day, when you're on vacation and there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls, or when there's a power outage, and you have no electricity to rely on, these thermo-bimetals will still be working tirelessly, efficiently and endlessly. Thank you.

You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses, and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.
So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.
It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.
And it comes in a male form, too -- very glamorous.
Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine, there actually is a little wine in there -- and of course, always wears a tuxedo.
But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning -- one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters, but also comes in other forms.
A magazine?
Well, it's certainly not this one.
This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it's all about sex tips.
Sex tips are not glamorous.
And Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm, is not glamorous either.
But there is a glamour of industry.
This is Margaret Bourke-White's -- one of her pictures she did.
Fantastic, glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places.
And there's the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur.
This is the Hewlett-Packard garage.
We know everyone who starts a business in a garage ends up founding Hewlett-Packard.
There's the glamour of physics.
What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe, grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene -- he has other kinds of glamour.
And there is, of course, this glamour.
This is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space -- and not the alien-style glamour, but the nice, clean, early '60s version.
So what do we mean by glamour?
Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary.
And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary, in this case the 1913 dictionary.
Because for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning, and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.
You had "a" glamour.
It wasn't glamour as a quality -- you "cast a glamour."
Glamour was a literal magic spell.
Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today, but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent, Celtic magic.
And over the years, around the turn of the 20th century, it started to take on this other kind of deception -- this definition for any artificial interest in, or association with, an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified.
But still, glamour is an illusion.
Glamour is a magic spell.
And there's something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell on you, it was not in your self-interest -- it was to get you to act against your interest.
Well of course, in the 20th century, glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood.
And this is Hedy Lamarr.
Hedy Lamarr said, "Anyone can look glamorous, all you have to do is sit there and look stupid."
But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy -- about whom we'll hear more later -- there's a lot more to it.
There was a tremendous amount of technical achievement associated with creating this Hollywood glamour.
There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts.
You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood and see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.
So you've got this highly stylized portrait of something that was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star.
And actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time -- they call them false color.
Glamour is a form of falsification, but falsification to achieve a particular purpose.
It may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.
And it involves a great deal of technique.
It's not -- glamour is not something -- you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.
Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.
There is a process of "idealization, glorification and dramatization," and it's not just the case for people.
Glamour doesn't have to be people.
Architectural photography -- Julius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration, took this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.
Architectural photography is extremely glamorous.
It puts you into this special, special world.
This is Alex Ross's comic book art, which appears to be extremely realistic, as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art.
Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world.
When you stack people in rows, the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground -- but not in the world of glamour.
What glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurb in the table of contents of New York magazine, which was telling us that glamour is back -- glamour is all about transcending the everyday.
And I think that that's starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is.
This is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia.
And I don't know who she is either, but this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel.
It's a very glamorous portrait.
Why is it glamorous?
It's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful -- but that does not make you glamorous, that only makes you beautiful.
She is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent, and those are the central qualities of glamour.
You don't see her eyes; they're looking downward.
She's not looking away from you exactly, but you have to mentally imagine her world.
She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture.
Mel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" -- not glamorous.
That's glamour: that's Michelangelo's "Pieta," where Mary is the same age as Jesus and they're both awfully happy and pleasant.
Glamour invites us to live in a different world.
It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant -- that's why, often in these glamour shots, the person is not looking at the audience, it's why sunglasses are glamorous -- but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.
In some sense, there has to be something like us.
So as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous.
God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent, omniscient -- too far above us.
And yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Mary will often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms.
As I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people, but it has to have this transcendent quality.
What is it about Superman?
Aside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous, one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.
Glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized, perfect place.
And this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous.
The less experience we have with them, the more glamorous they are.
So you can do a glamorized picture of a car, but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.
You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.
The notion is that it's going to transport you, and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane, who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.
The story is about where you're arriving, or thinking about where you're arriving.
And this sense of being transported is one reason that we have glamour styling.
This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period, but because, in it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday.
The same thing -- arches are very glamorous.
Arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous.
Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous.
I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because, to me, it captures the whole promise of the academic contemplative life -- but maybe that's because I went to Princeton.
Anyway, skylines are super glamorous, city streets -- not so glamorous.
You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.
The horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous.
There are few things more glamorous than the horizon -- except, possibly, multiple horizons.
Of course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat -- you just see the possibilities.
In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality of sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglione in his book, "The Book Of The Courtier."
There's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today, after a few centuries.
And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art.
It makes things look effortless.
You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress -- she just looks completely natural.
And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies, how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue.
Of course, they covered that with make-up, because Lara Croft did all those same stunts -- but she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura.
"To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort": And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour.
Glamour is about editing.
How do you create the sense of transcendence, the sense of evoking a perfect world?
The sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this -- I could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world.
We don't tell you all the grubby details.
Now, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year.
This is underneath Jeff's desk.
This is what the real world of computers, lamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.
But if you look in a catalog -- particularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home -- it looks like this.
There are no cords.
Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail -- you can usually figure out where they hid the cord.
But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp, you will live in a world without cords.
And the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer -- and even in these wireless eras, you don't get to live in the world without cords.
You have to have mystery and you have to have grace.
And there she is -- Grace.
This is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever.
Part of the thing is that, in "Rear Window," the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?
And the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.
Here's Hedy Lamarr again.
And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.
Translucence is glamorous -- that's why all these people wear pearls.
It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent -- not transparent, not opaque.
It invites us into the world but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.
And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person, maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot, because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.
It has that sense of going up and away, and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were -- particularly going down.
And of course glass block has that sense of translucence.
So, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour's really partly about meaning.
All individuals and all cultures have ideals that cannot possibly be realized in reality.
They have contradictions, they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other -- whatever it is -- and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose to our lives as cultures and as individuals.
And the way we deal with that is we displace them -- we put them into a golden world, an imagined world, an age of heroes, the world to come.
And in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object.
The white picket fence, the perfect house.
The perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen.
You know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like.
The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace, the perfect diamond ring.
The perfect getaway in your perfect car.
This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia.
The perfect office -- again, no cords, as far as I can tell.
And certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office.
I mean, there's no paper on the desk.
We want this golden world.
And some people get rich enough, and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense, they get to acquire their perfect world.
Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is -- I don't think accidentally -- in Art Deco style.
That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.
This is not always good, because what is your perfect world?
What is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out?
Is it something important?
"The Matrix" is a movie that is all about glamour.
I could do a whole talk on "The Matrix" and glamour.
It was criticized for glamorizing violence, because, look -- sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course, they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world.
This is another Margaret Bourke-White photo.
This is from Soviet Union. Attractive.
I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too.
You know, we're marching toward Utopia.
I'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad.
Because what they're doing is they're saying, your coat's not so glamorous, what's been edited out is something important.
But actually, what's even more important than remembering what's been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good?
Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive.
And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor.
This is from "Triumph Of The Will" -- brilliant editing to cut together things.
There's a glamour shot.
National Socialism is all about glamour.
It was a very aesthetic ideology.
It was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world, and ridding it of anything unglamorous.
So glamour can be dangerous.
I think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value.
I'm not against glamour.
But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life.
And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour and a way to broaden your appreciation of it.
And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice and confront the manipulation of it all, and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy, but also enjoy how it happens.
And here's Hedy Lamarr.
She's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology.
So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid, even though she thought she could look stupid.
David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash, which only took a fraction of a second to happen.
There is a book out in the bookstore -- it's called "Symphony In Steel," and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.
And that has a fascination.
It's not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal.
There's a wonderful book called "Crowns" that's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats.
And there's a quote from one of these women, and she talks about, "As a little girl, I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats.
They looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine.
But I also knew how hard they worked all week.
Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow."
And, actually, you get more appreciation for glamour when you realize what went into creating it.
Thank you.

<title>Virginia Postrel: On glamour</title>
<description>In a timely talk, cultural critic Virginia Postrel muses on the true meaning, and the powerful uses, of glamour -- which she defines as any calculated, carefully polished image designed to impress and persuade.</description>
<keywords>beauty,business,culture,entertainment,illusion,marketing,performance,politics</keywords>

For a long time, there was me, and my body.
Me was composed of stories, of cravings, of strivings, of desires of the future.
Me was trying not to be an outcome of my violent past, but the separation that had already occurred between me and my body was a pretty significant outcome.
Me was always trying to become something, somebody.
Me only existed in the trying.
My body was often in the way.
Me was a floating head.
For years, I actually only wore hats.
It was a way of keeping my head attached.
It was a way of locating myself.
I worried that [if] I took my hat off I wouldn't be here anymore.
I actually had a therapist who once said to me, "Eve, you've been coming here for two years, and, to be honest, it never occurred to me that you had a body."
All this time I lived in the city because, to be honest, I was afraid of trees.
I never had babies because heads cannot give birth.
Babies actually don't come out of your mouth.
As I had no reference point for my body, I began to ask other women about their bodies -- in particular, their vaginas, because I thought vaginas were kind of important.
This led to me writing "The Vagina Monologues," which led to me obsessively and incessantly talking about vaginas everywhere I could.
I did this in front of many strangers.
One night on stage, I actually entered my vagina.
It was an ecstatic experience.
It scared me, it energized me, and then I became a driven person, a driven vagina.
I began to see my body like a thing, a thing that could move fast, like a thing that could accomplish other things, many things, all at once.
I began to see my body like an iPad or a car.
I would drive it and demand things from it.
It had no limits. It was invincible.
It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself.
I didn't heed it; no, I organized it and I directed it.
I didn't have patience for my body; I snapped it into shape.
I was greedy.
I took more than my body had to offer.
If I was tired, I drank more espressos.
If I was afraid, I went to more dangerous places.
Oh sure, sure, I had moments of appreciation of my body, the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness.
My father was really kind to me on my 16th birthday, for example.
I heard people murmur from time to time that I should love my body, so I learned how to do this.
I was a vegetarian, I was sober, I didn't smoke.
But all that was just a more sophisticated way to manipulate my body -- a further disassociation, like planting a vegetable field on a freeway.
As a result of me talking so much about my vagina, many women started to tell me about theirs -- their stories about their bodies.
Actually, these stories compelled me around the world, and I've been to over 60 countries.
I heard thousands of stories, and I have to tell you, there was always this moment where the women shared with me that particular moment when she separated from her body -- when she left home.
I heard about women being molested in their beds, flogged in their burqas, left for dead in parking lots, acid burned in their kitchens.
Some women became quiet and disappeared.
Other women became mad, driven machines like me.
In the middle of my traveling, I turned 40 and I began to hate my body, which was actually progress, because at least my body existed enough to hate it.
Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated.
It was proof that I had not measured up, that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.
My stomach was proof that I had failed, that it had failed me, that it was broken.
My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it.
In fact, it became so extreme I wrote a play about it.
But the more I talked about it, the more objectified and fragmented my body became.
It became entertainment; it became a new kind of commodity, something I was selling.
Then I went somewhere else.
I went outside what I thought I knew.
I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
And I heard stories that shattered all the other stories.
I heard stories that got inside my body.
I heard about a little girl who couldn't stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her.
I heard an 80-year-old woman whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets and twisted up on her head as the soldiers raped her like that.
There are thousands of these stories, and many of the women had holes in their bodies -- holes, fistula -- that were the violation of war -- holes in the fabric of their souls.
These stories saturated my cells and nerves, and to be honest, I stopped sleeping for three years.
All the stories began to bleed together.
The raping of the Earth, the pillaging of minerals, the destruction of vaginas -- none of these were separate anymore from each other or me.
Militias were raping six-month-old babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iPhones and computers.
My body had not only become a driven machine, but it was responsible now for destroying other women's bodies in its mad quest to make more machines to support the speed and efficiency of my machine.
Then I got cancer -- or I found out I had cancer.
It arrived like a speeding bird smashing into a windowpane.
Suddenly, I had a body, a body that was pricked and poked and punctured, a body that was cut wide open, a body that had organs removed and transported and rearranged and reconstructed, a body that was scanned a body that was burning from chemicals.
Cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection.
I suddenly understood that the crisis in my body was the crisis in the world, and it wasn't happening later, it was happening now.
Suddenly, my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere, the cancer of cruelty, the cancer of greed, the cancer that gets inside people who live down the streets from chemical plants -- and they're usually poor -- the cancer inside the coal miner's lungs, the cancer of stress for not achieving enough, the cancer of buried trauma, the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish, the cancer in women's uteruses from being raped, the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness.
In his new and visionary book, "New Self, New World," the writer Philip Shepherd says, "If you are divided from your body, you are also divided from the body of the world, which then appears to be other than you or separate from you, rather than the living continuum to which you belong."
Before cancer, the world was something other.
It was as if I was living in a stagnant pool and cancer dynamited the boulder that was separating me from the larger sea.
Now I am swimming in it.
Now I lay down in the grass and I rub my body in it, and I love the mud on my legs and feet.
Now I make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine, and I hunger for the green fields in the bush outside Bukavu.
And when it rains hard rain, I scream and I run in circles.
I know that everything is connected, and the scar that runs the length of my torso is the markings of the earthquake.
And I am there with the three million in the streets of Port-au-Prince.
And the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world.
I know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation, the 16 ounces of puss, is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico, and there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me and dead floating fish.
And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out the way the Earth cries out from the drilling.
In my second chemo, my mother got very sick and I went to see her.
And in the name of connectedness, the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved Gulf of Mexico.
So we brought her home, and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died.
And gratefully, it didn't.
And she died quietly in her favorite place.
And a few weeks later, I was in New Orleans, and this beautiful, spiritual friend told me she wanted to do a healing for me.
And I was honored.
And I went to her house, and it was morning, and the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains.
And my friend was preparing this big bowl, and I said, "What is it?"
And she said, "It's for you.
The flowers make it beautiful, and the honey makes it sweet."
And I said, "But what's the water part?"
And in the name of connectedness, she said, "Oh, it's the Gulf of Mexico."
And I said, "Of course it is."
And the other women arrived and they sat in a circle, and Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water.
And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang.
And the other women sang and they prayed for me and my mother.
And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head, I realized that it held the best and the worst of us.
It was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion.
It was all the lies that got told before and after.
It was the honey in the water that made it sweet, it was the oil that made it sick.
It was my head that was bald -- and comfortable now without a hat.
It was my whole self melting into Michaela's lap.
It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf that were falling down my cheek.
It was finally being in my body.
It was the sorrow that's taken so long.
It was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection.
It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo and the indifference of the world.
It was the Congolese women who are now rising up.
It was my mother leaving, just at the moment that I was being born.
It was the realization that I had come very close to dying -- in the same way that the Earth, our mother, is barely holding on, in the same way that 75 percent of the planet are hardly scraping by, in the same way that there is a recipe for survival.
What I learned is it has to do with attention and resources that everybody deserves.
It was advocating friends and a doting sister.
It was wise doctors and advanced medicine and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands.
It was underpaid and really loving nurses.
It was magic healers and aromatic oils.
It was people who came with spells and rituals.
It was having a vision of the future and something to fight for, because I know this struggle isn't my own.
It was a million prayers.
It was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms.
It was a lot of anger, insane humor, a lot of attention, outrage.
It was energy, love and joy.
It was all these things.
It was all these things.
It was all these things in the water, in the world, in my body.

<title>Eve Ensler: Suddenly, my body</title>
<description>Poet, writer, activist Eve Ensler lived in her head. In this powerful talk from TEDWomen, she talks about her lifelong disconnection from her body -- and how two shocking events helped her to connect with the reality, the physicality of being human.</description>
<keywords>activism,arts,brain,cancer,culture,poetry</keywords>

Today I'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds.
And the problem I'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy, which is, "How can we know whether other people have minds?"
That is, maybe you have a mind, and everyone else is just a really convincing robot.
So that's a problem in philosophy, but for today's purposes I'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind, and that I don't have to worry about this.
There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses and novelists, which is, "Why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes?"
Or perhaps, more relevantly, "Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes?"
I think novelists put this best.
Like Philip Roth, who said, "And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people?
So ill equipped are we all, to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims."
So as a teacher and as a spouse, this is, of course, a problem I confront every day.
But as a scientist, I'm interested in a different problem of other minds, and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today.
And that problem is, "How is it so easy to know other minds?"
So to start with an illustration, you need almost no information, one snapshot of a stranger, to guess what this woman is thinking, or what this man is.
And put another way, the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds, our brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells, that we share with all other animals, with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs.
And yet, you put them together in a particular network, and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet.
Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did, "I know you think you understand what you thought I said, but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant."
So, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas, one in each hand.
And to try to understand how you can put together simple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network, and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds.
So I'm going to tell you three things about this today.
Obviously the whole project here is huge.
And I'm going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about other people's thoughts.
Some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job.
And then finally, to show that some of the differences between people, in how we judge others, can be explained by differences in this brain system.
So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains, whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts.
This is a picture of it.
It's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction.
It's above and behind your right ear.
And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you, or when you read Romeo and Juliet or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan.
And you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems.
So this brain region is called the Right TPJ.
And this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults.
They're MIT undergraduates.
The second thing I want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other minds, we weren't always that way.
It takes children a long time to break into the system.
I'm going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process.
The first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five, as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own.
So I'm going to show you a five-year-old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task.
Rebecca Saxe : This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan.
And you know what pirates really like?
What? RS: Pirates really like cheese sandwiches.
Cheese? I love cheese!
RS: Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich, and he says, "Yum yum yum yum yum!
I really love cheese sandwiches."
And Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest.
And Ivan says, "You know what? I need a drink with my lunch."
And so Ivan goes to get a drink.
And while Ivan is away the wind comes, and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass.
And now, here comes the other pirate.
This pirate is called Joshua.
And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches.
So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says, "Yum yum yum yum yum! I love cheese sandwiches."
And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest.
So, that one is his.
RS: That one is Joshua's. That's right.
And then his went on the ground.
RS: That's exactly right.
So he won't know which one is his.
RS: Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink.
Ivan comes back and he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
So which one do you think Ivan is going to take?
I think he is going to take that one.
RS: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right. Let's see.
Oh yeah, you were right. He took that one.
So that's a five-year-old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions.
Now I'm going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle.
RS: And Ivan says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
Which sandwich is he going to take?
Do you think he's going to take that one? Let's see what happens.
Let's see what he does. Here comes Ivan.
And he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
And he takes this one.
Uh-oh. Why did he take that one?
His was on the grass.
So the three-year-old does two things differently.
First, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich that's really his.
And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his, where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his, the three-year-old comes up with another explanation: He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it, because now it's dirty, on the ground.
So that's why he's taking the other sandwich.
Now of course, development doesn't end at five.
And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now, not for an action prediction, but for a moral judgment.
So first I'm going to show you the three-year-old again.
RS.: So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich?
Yeah.
RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?
Yeah.
So it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan to take Joshua's sandwich, since he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich.
But now I'm going to show you the five-year-old.
Remember the five-year-old completely understood why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich.
RS: Was Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich?
Um, yeah.
And so, it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response.
RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?
No, because the wind should get in trouble.
He says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches.
And now what we've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts.
So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ, being used while children are thinking about other people.
But it's not quite like the adult brain.
So whereas in the adults, as I told you, this brain region is almost completely specialized -- it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts -- in children it's much less so, when they are age five to eight, the age range of the children I just showed you.
And actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds, getting into early adolescence, they still don't have quite an adult-like brain region.
And so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence, both the cognitive system, our mind's ability to think about other minds, and the brain system that supports it are continuing, slowly, to develop.
But of course, as you're probably aware, even in adulthood, people differ from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds, how often they do it and how accurately.
And so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults in how they think about other people's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region?
So, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids.
And I'm going to give that to you now.
So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory, and they take a break for coffee.
And Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee.
Grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder, which is sugar.
But the powder is labeled "Deadly Poison," so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison.
And she puts it in her friend's coffee.
And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine.
How many people think it was morally permissible for Grace to put the powder in the coffee?
Okay. Good.
So we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed in this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm?
And we can compare that to another case, where everything in the real world is the same.
The powder is still sugar, but what's different is what Grace thinks.
Now she thinks the powder is sugar.
And perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend's coffee, people say she deserves no blame at all.
Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar, now people say she deserves a lot of blame, even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same.
And in fact, they say she deserves more blame in this case, the failed attempt to harm, than in another case, which we call an accident.
Where Grace thought the powder was sugar, because it was labeled "sugar" and by the coffee machine, but actually the powder was poison.
So even though when the powder was poison, the friend drank the coffee and died, people say Grace deserves less blame in that case, when she innocently thought it was sugar, than in the other case, where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred.
People, though, disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame Grace should get in the accident case.
Some people think she should deserve more blame, and other people less.
And what I'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they're making that judgment.
So what I'm showing you, from left to right, is how much activity there was in this brain region, and from top to bottom, how much blame people said that Grace deserved.
And what you can see is, on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region, people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident.
Whereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity, people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief, and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident.
So that's good, but of course what we'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region, and see if we could change people's moral judgment.
And we do have such a tool.
It's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation, or TMS.
This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebody's skull, into a small region of their brain, and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region.
So I'm going to show you a demo of this.
First, I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse.
I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine.
When you hear clicks, we're turning the machine on.
So now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain, to the part of my brain that controls my hand.
So there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse.
Woman : Ready, Rebecca? RS: Yes.
Okay, so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain.
And we can use that same pulse, now applied to the RTPJ, to ask if we can change people's moral judgments.
So these are the judgments I showed you before, people's normal moral judgments.
And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ and ask how people's judgments change.
And the first thing is, people can still do this task overall.
So their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same. They say she deserves no blame.
But in the case of a failed attempt to harm, where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar, people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee.
And in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar, but it was really poison and so she caused a death, people say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame.
So what I've told you today is that people come, actually, especially well equipped to think about other people's thoughts.
We have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking.
This system takes a long time to develop, slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence.
And even in adulthood, differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people.
But I want to give the last word back to the novelists, and to Philip Roth, who ended by saying, "The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway.
It's getting them wrong that is living.
Getting them wrong and wrong and wrong, and then on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again."
Thank you.
So, I have a question. When you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments, that sounds alarming.
Please tell me that you're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon, say.
RS: I'm not.
I mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call.
They really are calling?
So then seriously, you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads.
I mean, you're clearly an incredible human being, but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not-torture chamber, do acts that people here might be worried about.
RS: Yeah, we worry about this.
So, there's a couple of things to say about TMS.
One is that you can't be TMSed without knowing it.
So it's not a surreptitious technology.
It's quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes.
The changes I showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain, but they're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make.
And what we changed was not people's moral judgments when they're deciding what to do, when they're making action choices.
We changed their ability to judge other people's actions.
And so, I think of what I'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial, but studying the jury.
Is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education, to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments?
RS: That's one of the idealistic hopes.
The whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.
Until recently, what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animal's brain could do too, so we could study it in animal models.
We knew how brains see, and how they control the body and how they hear and sense.
And the whole project of understanding how brains do the uniquely human things -- learn language and abstract concepts, and thinking about other people's thoughts -- that's brand new.
And we don't know yet what the implications will be of understanding it.
So I've got one last question. There is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness, that puzzles a lot of people.
The notion that you can understand why a brain works, perhaps.
But why does anyone have to feel anything?
Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate?
You're a brilliant young neuroscientist.
I mean, what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career, someone, you or someone else, is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem?
RS: I hope they do. And I think they probably won't.
Why?
RS: It's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing.
That's a great answer. Rebecca Saxe, thank you very much. That was fantastic.

I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women run the show, have sex to say hello, and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business.
And no, this isn't Burning Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo.
Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, your living closest relative.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived around six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression.
But unfortunately, we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
While chimpanzees are dominated by big, scary guys, bonobo society is run by empowered females.
These guys have really worked something out, since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet.
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least understood of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it has been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War.
Not surprisingly, this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.
Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world -- and we're not even sure of that to be honest.
Yet, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees.
Who are these cousins?
We know them as the "make love, not war" apes since they have frequent, promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues.
Now, I'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity's problems -- since there's more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra.
Bonobos, like humans, love to play throughout their entire lives.
Play is not just child's games.
For us and them, play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance.
It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience, and it's all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you watch bonobo play, you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter, dance and ritual.
Play is the glue that binds us together.
Now, I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild.
First, it's a ball game bonobo-style -- and I do not mean football.
So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game.
Have a look what she's doing.
It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "she's got him by the balls."
Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right?
Yeah.
So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun.
But play's a shapeshifter.
Play's a shapeshifter, and it can take many forms, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew.
And I want you to see, this is Fuku, a young female, and she is quietly playing with water.
I think, like her, we sometimes play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, drives us to interact, and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity.
So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present.
But they also hold a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capacities.
In other words, play is our adaptive wildcard.
In order to adapt successfully to a changing world, we need to play.
But will we make the most of our playfulness?
Play is not frivolous.
Play's essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just red in tooth and claw.
In times when it seems least appropriate to play, it might be the times when it is most urgent.
And so, my fellow primates, let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together, as we rediscover creativity, fellowship and wonder.
Thank you.

<title>Isabel Behncke: Evolution's gift of play, from bonobo apes to humans</title>
<description>With never-before-seen video, primatologist Isabel Behncke Izquierdo shows how bonobo ape society learns from constantly playing -- solo, with friends, even as a prelude to sex. Indeed, play appears to be the bonobos' key to problem-solving and avoiding conflict. If it works for our close cousins, why not for us?</description>

This is my first trip, my first foreign trip as a first lady.
Can you believe that?
And while this is not my first visit to the U.K., I have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit.
The special relationship between the United States and the U.K.
is based not only on the relationship between governments, but the common language and the values that we share, and I'm reminded of that by watching you all today.
During my visit I've been especially honored to meet some of Britain's most extraordinary women -- women who are paving the way for all of you.
And I'm honored to meet you, the future leaders of Great Britain and this world.
And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant, with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America, and you, just getting through school, I want you to know that we have very much in common.
For nothing in my life's path would have predicted that I'd be standing here as the first African-American First Lady of the United States of America.
There is nothing in my story that would land me here.
I wasn't raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of.
I was raised on the South Side of Chicago.
That's the real part of Chicago.
And I was the product of a working-class community.
My father was a city worker all of his life, and my mother was a stay-at-home mom.
And she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother.
Neither of them attended university.
My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the prime of his life.
But even as it got harder for him to walk and get dressed in the morning -- I saw him struggle more and more -- my father never complained about his struggle.
He was grateful for what he had.
He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder.
And my brother and I were raised with all that you really need: love, strong values and a belief that with a good education and a whole lot of hard work, that there was nothing that we could not do.
I am an example of what's possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by the people around them.
I was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life: grandmothers, teachers, aunts, cousins, neighbors, who taught me about quiet strength and dignity.
And my mother, the most important role model in my life, who lives with us at the White House and helps to care for our two little daughters, Malia and Sasha.
She's an active presence in their lives, as well as mine, and is instilling in them the same values that she taught me and my brother: things like compassion, and integrity, and confidence, and perseverance -- all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love that only a grandmother can give.
I was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged by some strong male role models as well, including my father, my brother, uncles and grandfathers.
The men in my life taught me some important things, as well.
They taught me about what a respectful relationship should look like between men and women.
They taught me about what a strong marriage feels like: that it's built on faith and commitment and an admiration for each other's unique gifts.
They taught me about what it means to be a father and to raise a family.
And not only to invest in your own home but to reach out and help raise kids in the broader community.
And these were the same qualities that I looked for in my own husband, Barack Obama.
And when we first met, one of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date.
And his date was to go with him to a community meeting.
I know, how romantic.
But when we met, Barack was a community organizer.
He worked, helping people to find jobs and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods.
As he talked to the residents in that community center, he talked about two concepts.
He talked about "the world as it is" and "the world as it should be."
And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign.
What he said, that all too often, is that we accept the distance between those two ideas.
And sometimes we settle for the world as it is, even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations.
But Barack reminded us on that day, all of us in that room, that we all know what our world should look like.
We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like.
We all know.
And he urged the people in that meeting, in that community, to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas, to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be, one and the same.
And I think about that today because I am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of closing that gap.
You are the women who will build the world as it should be.
You're going to write the next chapter in history.
Not just for yourselves, but for your generation and generations to come.
And that's why getting a good education is so important.
That's why all of this that you're going through -- the ups and the downs, the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't -- why it's so important.
Because communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong as the health of their women.
And that's important to keep in mind.
Part of that health includes an outstanding education.
The difference between a struggling family and a healthy one is often the presence of an empowered woman or women at the center of that family.
The difference between a broken community and a thriving one is often the healthy respect between men and women who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society.
The difference between a languishing nation and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls.
And this school, named after the U.K.'s first female doctor, and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, Mary Seacole, the Jamaican nurse known as the "black Florence Nightingale," and the English author, Emily Bronte, honor women who fought sexism, racism and ignorance, to pursue their passions to feed their own souls.
They allowed for no obstacles.
As the sign said back there, "without limitations."
They knew no other way to live than to follow their dreams.
And having done so, these women moved many obstacles.
And they opened many new doors for millions of female doctors and nurses and artists and authors, all of whom have followed them.
And by getting a good education, you too can control your own destiny.
Please remember that.
If you want to know the reason why I'm standing here, it's because of education.
I never cut class. Sorry, I don't know if anybody is cutting class.
I never did it.
I loved getting As.
I liked being smart.
I liked being on time. I liked getting my work done.
I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world.
And you too, with these same values, can control your own destiny.
You too can pave the way.
You too can realize your dreams, and then your job is to reach back and to help someone just like you do the same thing.
History proves that it doesn't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate.
Your success will be determined by your own fortitude, your own confidence, your own individual hard work.
That is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in.
You now have control over your own destiny.
And it won't be easy -- that's for sure.
But you have everything you need.
Everything you need to succeed, you already have, right here.
My husband works in this big office.
They call it the Oval Office.
In the White House, there's the desk that he sits at -- it's called the Resolute desk.
It was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute and given by Queen Victoria.
It's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations.
And its name, Resolute, is a reminder of the strength of character that's required not only to lead a country, but to live a life of purpose, as well.
And I hope in pursuing your dreams, you all remain resolute, that you go forward without limits, and that you use your talents -- because there are many; we've seen them; it's there -- that you use them to create the world as it should be.
Because we are counting on you.
We are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be.
Because the world is big.
And it's full of challenges.
And we need strong, smart, confident young women to stand up and take the reins.
We know you can do it. We love you. Thank you so much.

Folks, you've just met Claron McFadden.
She is a world-class soprano singer who studied in Rochester, New York.
Her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied.
In August 2007, Claron was awarded the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts, winning praise for her brilliance, her amazing and extensively wide repertoire and her vivid stage personality.
Please welcome Claron McFadden.
Claron McFadden: The human voice: mysterious, spontaneous, primal.
For me, the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel -- except perhaps jealousy.
And the breath, the breath is the captain of that vessel.
A child is born, takes its first breath -- and we behold the wondrous beauty of vocal expression -- mysterious, spontaneous and primal.
A few years ago, I did a meditation retreat in Thailand.
I wanted a place that I would have total silence and total solitude.
I spent two weeks at this retreat in my own little hut -- no music, no nothing, sounds of nature -- trying to find the essence of concentration, being in the moment.
On my last day, the woman who looked after the place, she came and we spoke for a minute, and then she said to me, "Would you sing something for me?"
And I thought, but this is a place of total quiet and silence.
I can't make noise.
She said, "Please, sing for me."
So I closed my eyes, I took breath and the first thing that came up and out was "Summertime," Porgy and Bess.
Summertime and the living is easy Fish are jumping and the cotton is high Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-looking So hush little baby Don't you cry And I opened my eyes, and I saw that she had her eyes closed.
And after a moment, she opened her eyes and she looked at me and she said, "It's like meditation."
And in that moment I understood that everything I had gone to Thailand to look for, to search for, I had it already in my singing -- the calm, but alertness, the focus, but awareness, and being totally in the moment.
When you're totally in the moment, when I'm totally in the moment, the vessel of expression is open.
The emotions can flow from me to you and back.
Extremely profound experience.
There's a piece by a composer, an American composer called John Cage.
It's called "Aria."
It was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian.
And the thing about this piece that's so special -- if you see it behind me -- it's not notated in any way.
No notes, no flats, no sharps.
But it's a kind of structure, and the singer within this structure has total freedom to be creative, spontaneous.
For example, there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing -- pop, country and western, opera, jazz -- and you just have to be consistent with that color.
You see there are different lines: you choose in your own tempo in your own way to follow the line, but you must respect it, more or less.
And these little dots, these represent a sort of sound that's not a vocal, not a lyrical way of expressing the voice.
Using the body -- it could be sneezing, it could be coughing, it could be animals -- exactly -- clapping, whatever.
And there's different text.
There's Armenian, Russian, French, English, Italian.
So within this structure one is free.
To me, this piece is an ode to the voice because it's mysterious -- as we can see -- it's quite spontaneous, and it's primal.
So I would like to share this piece with you.
It's "Aria" of John Cage.
No other way Dans l'espace, so help To have the fruits

As a particle physicist, I study the elementary particles and how they interact on the most fundamental level.
For most of my research career, I've been using accelerators, such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road, to study things on the smallest scale.
But more recently, I've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale.
Because, as I'll explain to you, the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.
So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe, what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are -- at least some of the big questions.
So, recently, we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe -- and by ordinary matter, I mean you, me, the planets, the stars, the galaxies -- the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe.
Almost a quarter, or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe, is stuff that's invisible.
By invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum.
It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect.
It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum, which is what we use to detect things.
It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there?
We know it's there by its gravitational effects.
In fact, this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale, and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that.
What about the rest of the pie?
The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy.
More about that later, OK.
So for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter.
In these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this, most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy.
This huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy.
So we have these stars going around in circles like this.
As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK -- that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here, OK.
So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars, that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.
In other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance -- this is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK -- we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases from the center of the galaxy.
When those measurements are made, instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant, as a function of distance.
If it's constant, that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.
In fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.
And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves, and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy.
So we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.
Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space; they tend to cluster.
And this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster.
And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster.
They're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here.
So these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now, we take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical.
But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds.
They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK.
So all of these galaxies are moving.
We can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities, and figure out how much mass is in this cluster.
And again, what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see.
Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well.
But that cannot account for the mass either.
In fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter, OK.
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.
I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK, to try to remind you that it's there.
Can we see it more visually? Yes, we can.
And so let me lead you through how we can do this.
So here's an observer: it could be an eye; it could be a telescope.
And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.
How do we see that galaxy?
A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye.
Now, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?
Well, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye, right?
We say, the ray of light came this way; the galaxy must be there, OK.
Now, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies -- and don't forget the dark matter, OK.
Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this, we now need to take into account what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity.
And that was that the gravitational field, due to mass, will deflect not only the trajectory of particles, but will deflect light itself.
So this light ray will not continue in a straight line, but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye.
Where will this observer see the galaxy?
You can respond. Up, right?
We extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here.
Is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy?
Yes, great. I see people going down like this.
So a ray of light could go down, be bent up into the observer's eye, and the observer sees a ray of light here.
Now, take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe, OK, a three-dimensional space.
Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye?
Yes! The rays would lie on a -- I'd like to see -- yeah, on a cone.
So there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone -- that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye.
If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see?
A circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK.
Now, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector and the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line.
If they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.
Now, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK, to figure out what that image will look like.
Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise, that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect.
We call this gravitational lensing.
And so, this is your instrument, OK.
.
But ignore the top part.
It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.
So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass, I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.
We shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK.
So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing.
And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper -- I'm a physicist.
So, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle.
And now put the lens over the galaxy, and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring.
Now, move the base off to the side, and the ring will split up into arcs, OK.
And you can put it on top of any image.
On the graph paper, you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted.
And again, this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing.
OK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky?
Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies?
And the answer is yes.
And so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Well, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies -- those are the galaxies in the cluster.
They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically, of the background galaxies.
So the streaks that you see, all these streaks, are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.
So what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion we see in those images, we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster.
And it's an enormous amount of mass.
And also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this, that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies.
They are centered on some more spread out structure, and that is the dark matter in which the cluster is embedded, OK.
So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.
OK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following.
So the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter -- this gravitationally attracting stuff -- is that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter.
The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter.
And we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions that say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.
OK. So now, let's turn to dark energy.
So to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session.
And that is the fact that space itself is expanding.
So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe -- and so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK -- and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures, so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure, horizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are.
If you could do this, what you would find that with each passing day, each passing year, each passing billions of years, OK, the distance between galaxies is getting greater.
And it's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space.
They're not necessarily moving through space.
They're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger, OK.
That's what the expansion of the universe or space means.
So they're moving further apart.
Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well, is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.
But because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space, it tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.
So the expansion slows down with time.
So, in the last century, OK, people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever; whether it would slow down, you know, will be slowing down, but continue forever; slow down and stop, asymptotically stop; or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.
So a little over a decade ago, two groups of physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down, OK.
By how much less is it expanding today, compared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?
The startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments, was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago, OK.
So the expansion of space is actually speeding up.
This was a completely surprising result.
There is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK.
No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found.
It was the opposite of what was expected.
So we need something to be able to explain that.
Now it turns out, in the mathematics, you can put it in as a term that's an energy, but it's a completely different type of energy from anything we've ever seen before.
We call it dark energy, and it has this effect of causing space to expand.
But we don't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point, OK.
So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.
Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you, is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy are completely different things, OK.
There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe, and they have very different effects.
Dark matter, because it gravitationally attracts, it tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK.
So clusters of galaxies will tend to form, because of all this gravitational attraction.
Dark energy, on the other hand, is putting more and more space between the galaxies, makes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease, and so it impedes the growth of structure.
So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies, and how they -- their number density, how many there are as a function of time -- we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming.
In terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any, you know, really persuasive argument for dark energy.
Do we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes.
We have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter.
Now, what do I mean by well motivated?
I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon, OK, things that I haven't even talked about, that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting, new particle.
So, this is exactly what you want in physics: where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else.
But we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate, OK.
One or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different.
Now, we look for these dark matter particles because, after all, they are here in the room, OK, and they didn't come in the door.
They just pass through anything.
They can come through the building, through the Earth -- they're so non-interacting.
So one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.
So a crystal that will ring if that happens.
So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector.
And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota, OK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far.
They haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are.
There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy, to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.
The Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator, that we'll be turning on later this year.
It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the Large Hadron Collider.
Now, because they are so non-interactive, they will actually escape the detector, so their signature will be missing energy, OK.
Now, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy, so it will be hard to tell the difference.
And finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy -- ground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy.
So in terms of the big questions: what is dark matter? What is dark energy?
The big questions facing physics.
And I'm sure you have lots of questions, which I very much look forward to addressing over the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.

So I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.
And this is a pretty well-educated audience, so I imagine you all know something about AIDS.
You probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa are infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty, and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well.
If you know something more, you probably know that Uganda, to date, is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa that has had success in combating the epidemic.
Using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain, be faithful, and use condoms -- the ABC campaign -- they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years.
If you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years, and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic.
So today I'm going to talk about some things that you might not know about the epidemic, and I'm actually also going to challenge some of these things that you think that you do know.
To do that I'm going to talk about my research as an economist on the epidemic.
And I'm not really going to talk much about the economy.
I'm not going to tell you about exports and prices.
But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem that's more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology.
And I think in that sense, this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea.
Here I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline to think about problems of another.
So we think, first and foremost, AIDS is a policy issue.
And probably for most people in this room, that's how you think about it.
But this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic.
It's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it.
I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff, which is really the most important, but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually cannot develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works.
And the first thing that I want to talk about, the first thing I think we need to understand is: how do people respond to the epidemic?
So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you.
So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS, there's a really significant cost of sex.
If you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent, if you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress -- your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points.
That is a huge effect.
And so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex.
And in fact among gay men in the US we did see that kind of change in the 1980s.
So if we look in this particularly high-risk sample, they're being asked, "Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months?"
Over a period from '84 to '88, that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent.
It's a huge change in a very short period of time.
We didn't see anything like that in Africa.
So we don't have quite as good data, but you can see here the share of single men having pre-marital sex, or married men having extra-marital sex, and how that changes from the early '90s to late '90s, and late '90s to early 2000s. The epidemic is getting worse.
People are learning more things about it.
We see almost no change in sexual behavior.
These are just tiny decreases -- two percentage points -- not significant.
This seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this, and that to understand this you need to think about health the way than an economist does -- as an investment.
So if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program, it's important to think about how much it costs.
It's also important to think about what the benefit is.
And one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active.
If version 10 is coming out next week, there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine.
But your health decisions are the same.
Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie, every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies, that's a costly investment in your health.
But how much you want to invest is going to depend on how much longer you expect to live in the future, even if you don't make those investments.
AIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS.
People really like to have sex.
But, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity.
But life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low: 40 or 50 years in a lot of places.
I think it's possible, if we think about that intuition, and think about that fact, that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change.
But we really need to test that.
And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see: do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more?
And the way that I'm going to do that is, I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria.
So malaria is a disease that kills you.
It's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa, in addition to a lot of children.
And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria.
some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there's less malaria.
So that's what this figure shows you.
This shows you -- in areas with low malaria, medium malaria, high malaria -- what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence.
If you look at the blue line, the areas with low levels of malaria, you can see in those areas, actually, the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot as HIV prevalence goes up.
Areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some -- it doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria -- actually, it's increasing a little bit, although that's not significant.
This is not just through malaria.
Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality change their behavior less in response to HIV than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality.
There's another risk, and they respond less to this existing risk.
So by itself, I think this tells a lot about how people behave.
It tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa.
But it also tells us something about policy.
Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa, it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria, in combating poor indoor air quality, in improving maternal mortality rates.
Because if you improve those things, then people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own.
But it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before.
Education campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding, may not be enough, at least not alone.
If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own, even if they know everything about the disease, they still may not change their behavior.
So the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself.
People aren't changing their behavior enough to decrease the growth in the epidemic.
So we're going to need to think about policy and what kind of policies might be effective.
And a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past.
The reason that we know that the ABC campaign was effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time.
In Uganda we see the prevalence went down.
We know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works.
It's not the only place we had any interventions.
Other places have tried things, so why don't we look at those places and see what happened to their prevalence?
Unfortunately, there's almost no good data on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003.
So if I asked you, "Why don't you go and find me the prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991?"
You get on Google, you Google, and you find, actually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in 1991 are STD patients and pregnant women, which is not a terribly representative group of people.
you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year, because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users.
But even worse -- some years it's only IV drug users, some years it's only pregnant women.
We have no way to figure out what happened over time.
We have no consistent testing.
Now in the last few years, we actually have done some good testing.
In Kenya, in Zambia, and a bunch of countries, there's been testing in random samples of the population.
But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge.
So I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003, but I can't tell you anything about 1993 or 1983.
So this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research.
And I started thinking about how else might we figure out what the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past.
And I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data, and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.
To do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease.
It kills people in the prime of their lives.
Not a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here -- this is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt.
Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS, Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS.
And you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people.
That suggests it's pretty similar levels of development.
But in this middle region, between 20 and 45, the death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt.
But since there are very few other diseases that kill people, we can really attribute that mortality to HIV.
But because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago, we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past.
So it turns out, if you use this technique, actually your estimates of prevalence are very close to what we get from testing random samples in the population, but they're very, very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are.
So this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS, and prevalence based on the mortality data for the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in Africa.
You can see, almost without exception, the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates.
UNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is 20 percent, and mortality estimates suggest it's only about 5 percent.
And these are not trivial differences in mortality rates.
So this is another way to see this.
You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says, we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000 rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group.
I'm going to talk a little bit in a minute about how we can use this kind of information to learn something that's going to help us think about the world.
But this also tells us that one of these facts that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right.
If you think that 25 million people are infected, if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high, maybe that's more like 10 or 15 million.
It doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem.
But it does suggest that that number might be a little big.
What I really want to do, is I want to use this new data to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower.
And I said in the beginning, I wasn't going to tell you about exports.
When I started working on these projects, I was not thinking at all about economics, but eventually it kind of sucks you back in.
So I am going to talk about exports and prices.
And I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity, in particular export volume, and HIV infections.
So obviously, as an economist, I'm deeply familiar with the fact that development, that openness to trade, is really good for developing countries.
It's good for improving people's lives.
But openness and inter-connectedness, it comes with a cost when we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise.
On Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett that I'm definitely going to get the bird flu, and I wouldn't be at all worried about that if we never had any contact with Asia.
And HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit.
The epidemic was introduced to the US by actually one male steward on an airline flight, who got the disease in Africa and brought it back.
And that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US.
In Africa, epidemiologists have noted for a long time that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people.
Areas with a lot of economic activity -- with a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization -- those areas have higher prevalence than others.
But that actually doesn't mean at all that if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence.
By using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time, we can actually test that. And so it seems to be -- that these things are positively related.
More exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big.
So the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume, it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections.
So this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy.
From a forecasting perspective, if we know where trade is likely to change, for example, because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act or other policies that encourage trade, we can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV.
And we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there.
Likewise, as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports, if we know there's this externality -- this extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports -- we can think about what the right kinds of policies are.
But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know.
Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS, in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS, it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty -- at least in the short run, that improving exports and improving development -- to a decline in HIV prevalence.
So throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times the special case of Uganda, and the fact that it's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention.
It's been widely heralded.
It's been replicated in Kenya, and Tanzania, and South Africa and many other places.
But now I want to actually also question that.
Because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence in Uganda in the 1990s. It's true that they had an education campaign.
But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period.
There was a big decline in coffee prices.
Coffee is Uganda's major export.
Their exports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up really, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections.
the black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections -- you can see they're both increasing.
Starting about 1987 they're both going down a lot.
And then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade.
So if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the data that I talked about before, it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of the decline in prevalence in Uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign.
But that's enormously important for policy.
We're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.
And if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was, then there are all sorts of other things maybe we should be spending our money on instead.
Trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases.
Trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision.
There are tons of other things that we should think about doing.
And maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things.
I hope that in the last 16 minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS, and I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit some of the things that you did know.
And I hope that I've convinced you maybe that it's important to understand things about the epidemic in order to think about policy.
But more than anything, you know, I'm an academic.
And when I leave here, I'm going to go back and sit in my tiny office, and my computer, and my data.
And the thing that's most exciting about that is every time I think about research, there are more questions.
There are more things that I think that I want to do.
And what's really, really great about being here is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very, very different than the questions that I think up myself.
And I can't wait to hear about what they are.
So thank you very much.

<title>Emily Oster: Flip your thinking on AIDS in Africa</title>
<description>Emily Oster re-examines the stats on AIDS in Africa from an economic perspective and reaches a stunning conclusion: Everything we know about the spread of HIV on the continent is wrong.</description>
<keywords>AIDS,Africa,Featured,economics,global issues,health,science,statistics</keywords>

If I could reveal anything that is hidden from us, at least in modern cultures, it would be to reveal something that we've forgotten, that we used to know as well as we knew our own names.
And that is that we live in a competent universe, that we are part of a brilliant planet, and that we are surrounded by genius.
Biomimicry is a new discipline that tries to learn from those geniuses, and take advice from them, design advice.
That's where I live, and it's my university as well.
I'm surrounded by genius. I cannot help but remember the organisms and the ecosystems that know how to live here gracefully on this planet.
This is what I would tell you to remember if you ever forget this again.
Remember this.
This is what happens every year.
This is what keeps its promise.
While we're doing bailouts, this is what happened.
Spring.
Imagine designing spring.
Imagine that orchestration.
You think TED is hard to organize. Right?
Imagine, and if you haven't done this in a while, do.
Imagine the timing, the coordination, all without top-down laws, or policies, or climate change protocols.
This happens every year.
There is lots of showing off.
There is lots of love in the air.
There's lots of grand openings.
And the organisms, I promise you, have all of their priorities in order.
I have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this, because he's living, usually on his back, looking up at those grasses.
And one time he came up to me -- he was about seven or eight years old -- he came up to me.
And there was a wasp's nest that I had let grow in my yard, right outside my door.
And most people knock them down when they're small.
But it was fascinating to me, because I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers.
And he came up to me and he knocked.
He would come every day with something to show me.
And like, knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up.
And he asked me how I had made the house for those wasps, because he had never seen one this big.
And I told him, "You know, Cody, the wasps actually made that."
And we looked at it together.
And I could see why he thought, you know -- it was so beautifully done.
It was so architectural. It was so precise.
But it occurred to me, how in his small life had he already believed the myth that if something was that well done, that we must have done it.
How did he not know -- it's what we've all forgotten -- that we're not the first ones to build.
We're not the first ones to process cellulose.
We're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones to try to optimize packing space, or to waterproof, or to try to heat and cool a structure.
We're not the first ones to build houses for our young.
What's happening now, in this field called biomimicry, is that people are beginning to remember that organisms, other organisms, the rest of the natural world, are doing things very similar to what we need to do.
But in fact they are doing them in a way that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet for billions of years.
So these people, biomimics, are nature's apprentices.
And they're focusing on function.
What I'd like to do is show you a few of the things that they're learning.
They have asked themselves, "What if, every time I started to invent something, I asked, 'How would nature solve this?'" And here is what they're learning.
This is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley.
This is a story about an engineer at J.R. West.
They're the people who make the bullet train.
It was called the bullet train because it was rounded in front, but every time it went into a tunnel it would build up a pressure wave, and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited.
So the engineer's boss said, "Find a way to quiet this train."
He happened to be a birder.
He went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting.
And he studied -- there was a film about king fishers.
And he thought to himself, "They go from one density of medium, the air, into another density of medium, water, without a splash. Look at this picture.
Without a splash, so they can see the fish.
And he thought, "What if we do this?"
Quieted the train.
Made it go 10 percent faster on 15 percent less electricity.
How does nature repel bacteria?
We're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves from some bacteria.
Turns out that -- this is a Galapagos Shark.
It has no bacteria on its surface, no fouling on its surface, no barnacles.
And it's not because it goes fast.
It actually basks. It's a slow-moving shark.
So how does it keep its body free of bacteria build-up?
It doesn't do it with a chemical.
It does it, it turns out, with the same denticles that you had on Speedo bathing suits, that broke all those records in the Olympics, but it's a particular kind of pattern.
And that pattern, the architecture of that pattern on its skin denticles keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere.
There is a company called Sharklet Technologies that's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals to keep bacteria from landing, which is better than dousing it with anti-bacterials or harsh cleansers that many, many organisms are now becoming drug resistant.
Hospital-acquired infections are now killing more people every year in the United States than die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined -- about 100,000.
This is a little critter that's in the Namibian desert.
It has no fresh water that it's able to drink, but it drinks water out of fog.
It's got bumps on the back of its wing covers.
And those bumps act like a magnet for water.
They have water-loving tips, and waxy sides.
And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips.
And it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth.
There is actually a scientist here at Oxford who studied this, Andrew Parker.
And now kinetic and architectural firms like Grimshaw are starting to look at this as a way of coating buildings so that they gather water from the fog.
10 times better than our fog-catching nets.
CO2 as a building block.
Organisms don't think of CO2 as a poison.
Plants and organisms that make shells, coral, think of it as a building block.
There is now a cement manufacturing company starting in the United States called Calera.
They've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef, and they're using CO2 as a building block in cement, in concrete.
Instead of -- cement usually emits a ton of CO2 for every ton of cement.
Now it's reversing that equation, and actually sequestering half a ton of CO2 thanks to the recipe from the coral.
None of these are using the organisms.
They're really only using the blueprints or the recipes from the organisms.
How does nature gather the sun's energy?
This is a new kind of solar cell that's based on how a leaf works.
It's self-assembling.
It can be put down on any substrate whatsoever.
It's extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years.
It's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun, with Paul Hawken.
There are many many ways that nature filters water that takes salt out of water.
We take water and push it against a membrane.
And then we wonder why the membrane clogs and why it takes so much electricity.
Nature does something much more elegant.
And it's in every cell.
Every red blood cell of your body right now has these hourglass-shaped pores called aquaporins.
They actually export water molecules through.
It's kind of a forward osmosis.
They export water molecules through, and leave solutes on the other side.
A company called Aquaporin is starting to make desalination membranes mimicking this technology.
Trees and bones are constantly reforming themselves along lines of stress.
This algorithm has been put into a software program that's now being used to make bridges lightweight, to make building beams lightweight.
Actually G.M. Opel used it to create that skeleton you see, in what's called their bionic car.
It lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material, as an organism must, for the maximum amount of strength.
This beetle, unlike this chip bag here, this beetle uses one material, chitin.
And it finds many many ways to put many functions into it.
It's waterproof.
It's strong and resilient.
It's breathable. It creates color through structure.
Whereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things.
One of our major inventions that we need to be able to do to come even close to what these organisms can do is to find a way to minimize the amount of material, the kind of material we use, and to add design to it.
We use five polymers in the natural world to do everything that you see.
In our world we use about 350 polymers to make all this.
Nature is nano.
Nanotechnology, nanoparticles, you hear a lot of worry about this.
Loose nanoparticles. What is really interesting to me is that not many people have been asking, "How can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe?"
Nature has been doing that for a long time.
Embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance, always.
In fact, sulfur-reducing bacteria, as part of their synthesis, they will emit, as a byproduct, nanoparticles into the water.
But then right after that, they emit a protein that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles so that they fall out of solution.
Energy use. Organisms sip energy, because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get.
And one of the largest fields right now, in the world of energy grids, you hear about the smart grid.
One of the largest consultants are the social insects.
Swarm technology. There is a company called Regen.
They are looking at how ants and bees find their food and their flowers in the most effective way as a whole hive.
And they're having appliances in your home talk to one another through that algorithm, and determine how to minimize peak power use.
There's a group of scientists in Cornell that are making what they call a synthetic tree, because they are saying, "There is no pump at the bottom of a tree."
It's capillary action and transpiration pulls water up, a drop at a time, pulling it, releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots.
And they're creating -- you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper.
They're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings to move water up without pumps.
Amazon electric eel -- incredibly endangered, some of these species -- create 600 volts of electricity with the chemicals that are in your body.
Even more interesting to me is that 600 volts doesn't fry it.
You know we use PVC, and we sheath wires with PVC for insulation.
These organisms, how are they insulating against their own electric charge?
These are some questions that we've yet to ask.
Here's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale.
Humpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers.
And those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by 32 percent.
These wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds, as a result.
MIT just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips.
And it's based on the cochlear of your ear, able to pick up internet, wireless, television signals and radio signals, in the same chip.
Finally, on an ecosystem scale.
At Biomimicry Guild, which is my consulting company, we work with HOK Architects.
We're looking at building whole cities in their planning department.
And what we're saying is that, shouldn't our cities do at least as well, in terms of ecosystem services, as the native systems that they replace?
So we're creating something called Ecological Performance Standards that hold cities to this higher bar.
The question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate.
The question I would ask is, "What's worth solving?"
If you haven't seen this, it's pretty amazing.
Dr. Adam Neiman.
This is a depiction of all of the water on Earth in relation to the volume of the Earth -- all the ice, all the fresh water, all the sea water -- and all the atmosphere that we can breathe, in relation to the volume of the Earth.
And inside those balls life, over 3.8 billion years, has made a lush, livable place for us.
And we are in a long, long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves, "How can we live here gracefully over the long haul?"
How can we do what life has learned to do?
Which is to create conditions conducive to life.
Now in order to do this, the design challenge of our century, I think, we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses, and to somehow meet them again.
One of the big ideas, one of the big projects I've been honored to work on is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it.
It's called AskNature.org.
And what we're trying to do, in a TEDesque way, is to organize all biological information by design and engineering function.
And we're working with EOL, Encyclopedia of Life, Ed Wilson's TED wish.
And he's gathering all biological information on one website.
And the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question, "What can we learn from this organism?"
And that information will go into AskNature.org.
And hopefully, any inventor, anywhere in the world, will be able, in the moment of creation, to type in, "How does nature remove salt from water?"
And up will come mangroves, and sea turtles and your own kidneys.
And we'll begin to be able to do as Cody does, and actually be in touch with these incredible models, these elders that have been here far, far longer than we have.
And hopefully, with their help, we'll learn how to live on this Earth, and on this home that is ours, but not ours alone.
Thank you very much.

<keywords>biodiversity,biology,biomimicry,biotech,creativity,design,innovation,invention,nature</keywords>

Now I'm going to give you a story.
It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.
Let me begin with my parents.
I'm a product of this visionary mother and father.
Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s -- '50s and '60s didn't belong to girls in India.
They belonged to boys.
They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents, and girls would be dolled up to get married.
My family, in my city, and almost in the country, was unique.
We were four of us, not one, and fortunately no boys.
We were four girls and no boys.
And my parents were part of a landed property family.
My father defied his own grandfather, almost to the point of disinheritance, because he decided to educate all four of us.
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education.
As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents, and when we go to school, we don't choose our school.
Children don't choose a school.
They just get the school which parents choose for them.
So this is the foundation time which I got.
I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters.
And my father used to say at that time, "I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world."
I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened.
I'm the only one who's left in India.
One is a British, another is an American and the third is a Canadian.
So we are four of us in four corners of the world.
And since I said they're my role models, I followed two things which my father and mother gave me.
One, they said, "Life is on an incline.
You either go up, or you come down."
And the second thing, which has stayed with me, which became my philosophy of life, which made all the difference, is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.
Out of 100, 90 are your creation.
They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it.
If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it.
Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing.
It's like a death of a relative, or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake.
You can't do a thing about it.
You've got to just respond to the situation.
But that response comes out of those 90 points.
Since I'm a product of this philosophy, of 90/10, and secondly, "life on an incline," that's the way I grew up to be valuing what I got.
I'm a product of opportunities, rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s, which girls didn't get, and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique.
Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry, and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities.
I thought I must tell you this.
Why I said this, is the background.
This is what comes next.
I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman, a woman with indefatigable stamina, because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc.
But I joined the Indian Police Service, and then it was a new pattern of policing.
For me the policing stood for power to correct, power to prevent and power to detect.
This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India -- the power to prevent.
Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it, or power to punish.
But I decided no, it's a power to prevent, because that's what I learned when I was growing up.
How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10?
So this was how it came into my service, and it was different from the men.
I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different, because this was the way I was different.
And I redefined policing concepts in India.
I'm going to take you on two journeys, my policing journey and my prison journey.
What you see, if you see the title called "PM's car held."
This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket.
That's the first time in India, and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it.
It'll never happen again in India, because now it was once and forever.
And the rule was, because I was sensitive, I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice, and I was very pro-justice.
That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service.
I had other options, but I didn't choose them.
So I'm going to move on.
This is about tough policing, equal policing.
Now I was known as "here's a woman that's not going to listen."
So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings, postings which others would say no.
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer.
Normally police officers don't want to do prison.
They sent me to prison to lock me up, thinking, "Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to.
Let's lock her up."
Here I got a prison assignment.
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals.
Obviously, it was.
But 10,000 men, of which only 400 were women -- 10,000 -- 9,000 plus about 600 were men.
Terrorists, rapists, burglars, gangsters -- some of them I'd sent to jail as a police officer outside.
And then how did I deal with them?
The first day when I went in, I didn't know how to look at them.
And I said, "Do you pray?" When I looked at the group, I said, "Do you pray?"
They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit.
I said, "Do you pray?"
And they didn't say anything.
I said, "Do you pray? Do you want to pray?"
They said, "Yes." I said, "All right, let's pray."
I prayed for them, and things started to change.
This is a visual of education inside the prison.
Friends, this has never happened, where everybody in the prison studies.
I started this with community support.
Government had no budget.
It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism in any prison in the world.
This was initiated in Delhi prison.
You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class.
These are hundreds of classes.
Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program -- the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten.
We converted this into an ashram -- from a prison to an ashram through education.
I think that's the bigger change.
It was the beginning of a change.
Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers.
Books came from donated schoolbooks.
Stationery was donated.
Everything was donated, because there was no budget of education for the prison.
Now if I'd not done that, it would have been a hellhole.
That's the second landmark.
I want to show you some moments of history in my journey, which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world.
One, the numbers you'll never get to see.
Secondly, this concept.
This was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners.
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation.
This was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor.
And this is what transformed.
You want to know more about this, go and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana."
You will hear about it, and you will love it.
And write to me on KiranBedi.com, and I'll respond to you.
Let me show you the next slide.
I took the same concept of mindfulness, because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison?
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind.
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control.
Not by preaching, not by telling, not by reading, but by addressing your mind.
I took the same thing to the police, because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds, and they felt as if it was "we" and "they," and that the people don't cooperate.
This worked.
This is a feedback box called a petition box.
This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints, listen to grievances.
This was a magic box.
This was a sensitive box.
This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison.
If you see somebody in the blue -- yeah, this guy -- he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher.
And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste.
Let me wrap it up.
I'm currently into movements, movements of education of the under-served children, which is thousands -- India is all about thousands.
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India.
That's a big way we, as a small group of activists, have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India.
Friends, you will hear a lot about it.
That's the movement at the moment I'm driving, and that's the movement and ambition of my life.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Twelve years ago, I founded Zipcar.
Zipcar buys cars and parks them throughout dense metropolitan areas for people to use, by the hour and by the day, instead of owning their own cars.
Each Zipcar replaces 15 personal cars, and each driver drives about 80 percent less because they're now paying the full cost, all at once, in real time.
But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm.
Now, a decade later, it's really time to push the envelope a little bit, and so a couple years ago I moved to Paris with my husband and youngest child, and we launched Buzzcar a year ago.
Buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars to their friends and neighbors.
Instead of investing in a car, we invest in a community.
We bring the power of a corporation to individuals who add their cars to the network.
Some people call this peer-to-peer.
This does express the humanity of what's going on, and the personal relationships, but that is also like saying that it's the same thing as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting.
That's peer-to-peer.
It's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay, or craft fairs are the same thing as Etsy.
But what's really happening is that we've got the power of a free and open Internet, and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation, and the peers are now in partnership with the company, creating shared value on shared values, and each strengthening the other, and doing what the other can't do.
I call this Peers, Inc.
The incorporated side, the company, is doing things that it does really well.
What does it do really well? It creates economies of scale, significant and long-term resource investment, the expertise of many different kinds of people and different kinds of minds, and for individuals, consumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recourse that we really want as consumers, and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise, and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation.
Peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do.
What do they bring? They bring this fabulous diversity, expensive for companies. And what does that deliver?
It delivers localization and customization, specialization, and all of this aspect about social networks and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there?
It's natural for me. Me and my friends, I can connect to them easily.
And it also delivers really fabulous innovation, and I'll talk about that later.
So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product, and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do.
The two of these are delivering the best of both worlds.
Some of my favorite examples: in transportation, Carpooling.com. Ten years old, three and a half million people have joined up, and a million rides are shared every day.
It's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent of 2,500 TGV trains, and just think, they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car.
This is all happening with excess capacity.
And it's not just with transportation, my love, but of course in other realms. Here's Fiverr.com.
I met these founders just weeks after they had launched, and now, in two years, what would you do for five dollars?
Seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years, what people would do for five dollars.
And not just easy things that anyone can do.
This Peers, Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm.
TopCoder has 400,000 engineers who are delivering complex design and engineering services.
When I talked to their CEO, he had this great line.
He said, "We have a community that owns its own company."
And then my all-time favorite, Etsy.
Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they're selling it in a marketplace.
It just celebrated its seventh anniversary, and after seven years, last year it delivered 530 million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects.
I know you guys out there who are businesspeople, are thinking, "Oh my God, I want to build one of those.
I see this incredible speed and scale.
You mean all I have to do is build a platform and all these people are going to put their stuff on top and I sit back and roll it in?"
Building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do.
I think of the difference of Google Video versus YouTube.
Who would have thought that two young guys and a start-up would beat out Google Video? Why?
I actually have no idea why. I didn't talk to them.
But I'm thinking, you know, they probably had the "share" button a little bit brighter and to the right, and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides that are always participating on these networks.
So I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now, and a Peers, Inc. company, because I've spent the last two years doing that in Paris.
So let me take you back how it's so incredibly different building Buzzcar than it was building Zipcar, because now every single thing we do has these two different bodies that I have to be thinking about: the owners who are going to provide the cars and the drivers who are going to rent them.
Every single decision, I have to think about what is right for both sides.
There are many, many examples and I'll give you one that is not my favorite example: insurance.
It took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right.
Hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative, they'd never thought of it before.
Way too much money, I just can't even go there, with lawyers, trying to figure out how this is different, who's responsible to whom, and the result was that we were able to provide owners protection for their own driving records and their own history.
The cars are completely insured during the rental, and it gives drivers what they need, and what do they need?
They need a low deductible, and 24-hour roadside assistance.
So this was a trick to get these two sides.
So now I want to take you to the moment of -- When you're an entrepreneur, and you've started a new company, there's the, here's all the stuff we do beforehand, and then the service launches. What happens?
So all those months of work, they come into play.
Last June 1, we launched. It was an exciting moment.
And all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting.
All the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent.
The reservations start coming in, and here, owners who were getting text messages and emails that said, "Hey, Joe wants to rent your car for the weekend.
You can earn 60 euros. Isn't that great? Yes or no?"
No reply. Like, a huge proportion of them couldn't be bothered after they had just started, they just signed up, to reply.
So I thought, "Duh, Robin, this is the difference between industrial production and peer production."
Industrial production, the whole point of industrial production is to provide a standardized, exact service model that is consistent every single time, and I'm really thankful that my smartphone is made using industrial production.
And Zipcar provides a very nice, consistent service that works fabulously.
But what does peer production do? Peer production is this completely different way of doing things, and you have a big quality range, and so eBay, cleverly, the first peer production, Peer, Inc. company, I'd say, they figured out early on, we need to have ratings and commentaries and all that yucky side stuff.
We can flag that and we can put it to the side, and people who are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it.
So going back, this is my look of excitement and joy, because all this stuff that I'd also been hoping for actually really did happen, and what's that?
That is the diversity of what's going on.
You have these different fabulous owners and their different cars, different prices, different locations.
They dress differently, and they look different, and, really, I love these photos every time I look at them.
Cool guys, excited guys, and here is Selma, who -- I love this driver.
And after a year, we have 1,000 cars that are parked across France and 6,000 people who are members and eager to drive them.
This would not be possible to do that in economic fashion for a traditional company.
Back to this spectrum.
So what's happening is, we had the yuck side, but we actually had this real wow side.
And I can tell you two great stories.
A driver was telling me that they went to rent a car to go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them, and said, "You know what, here's where the cliffs are, and here's all the beaches, and this is my best beach, and this is where the best fish restaurant is."
And the peers also become, peers and owners create relationships, and so at the last minute people can -- a driver can say, "Hey, you know what, I really need the car, is it available?" And that person will say, "Sure, my wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it."
So you can have these really nice things that can't happen, and it's a kind of "Wow!" and I want to say "Wow!"
type of thing that's happening here, because individuals, if you're a company, what happens is you might have 10 people who are in charge of innovation, or 100 people who are in charge of innovation.
What happens in Peer, Inc. companies is that you have tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions of people who are creating experiments on this model, and so out of all that influence and that effort, you are having this exceptional amount of innovation that is coming out.
So one of the reasons, if we come back to why did I call it Buzzcar? I wanted to remind all of us about the power of the hive, and its incredible facility to create this platform that individuals want to participate and innovate on.
And for me, when I think about our future, and all of those problems that seem incredibly large, the scale is impossible, the urgency is there, Peers, Inc. provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems.
All we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation -- nontrivial.
So I continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe.
All problems come back to transportation for me.
But there are all these other areas that are these profound, big problems that I know that we can work on, and people are working on them in many different sectors, but there's this really fabulous group of things with the power of this Peers, Inc. model.
So over the last decade, we've been reveling in the power of the Internet and how it's empowered individuals, and for me, what Peers, Inc. does is it takes it up a notch. We're now bringing the power of the company and the corporation and supercharging individuals.
So for me, it's a collaboration.
Together, we can.
Thank you.

So, embryonic stem cells are really incredible cells.
They are our body's own repair kits, and they're pluripotent, which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies.
Soon, we actually will be able to use stem cells to replace cells that are damaged or diseased.
But that's not what I want to talk to you about, because right now there are some really extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells that are completely changing the way we look and model disease, our ability to understand why we get sick, and even develop drugs.
I truly believe that stem cell research is going to allow our children to look at Alzheimer's and diabetes and other major diseases the way we view polio today, which is as a preventable disease.
So here we have this incredible field, which has enormous hope for humanity, but much like IVF over 35 years ago, until the birth of a healthy baby, Louise, this field has been under siege politically and financially.
Critical research is being challenged instead of supported, and we saw that it was really essential to have private safe haven laboratories where this work could be advanced without interference.
And so, in 2005, we started the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory so that we would have a small organization that could do this work and support it.
What we saw very quickly is the world of both medical research, but also developing drugs and treatments, is dominated by, as you would expect, large organizations, but in a new field, sometimes large organizations really have trouble getting out of their own way, and sometimes they can't ask the right questions, and there is an enormous gap that's just gotten larger between academic research on the one hand and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs that are responsible for delivering all of our drugs and many of our treatments, and so we knew that to really accelerate cures and therapies, we were going to have to address this with two things: new technologies and also a new research model.
Because if you don't close that gap, you really are exactly where we are today.
And that's what I want to focus on.
We've spent the last couple of years pondering this, making a list of the different things that we had to do, and so we developed a new technology, It's software and hardware, that actually can generate thousands and thousands of genetically diverse stem cell lines to create a global array, essentially avatars of ourselves.
And we did this because we think that it's actually going to allow us to realize the potential, the promise, of all of the sequencing of the human genome, but it's going to allow us, in doing that, to actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells, not animal cells, to generate drugs and treatments that are much more effective, much safer, much faster, and at a much lower cost.
So let me put that in perspective for you and give you some context.
This is an extremely new field.
In 1998, human embryonic stem cells were first identified, and just nine years later, a group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell called an induced pluripotent stem cell, or what we refer to as an IPS cell.
This was really an extraordinary advance, because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells, which still remain the gold standard, they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery.
So a few months later, in 2008, one of our scientists built on that research. He took skin biopsies, this time from people who had a disease, ALS, or as you call it in the U.K., motor neuron disease.
He turned them into the IPS cells that I've just told you about, and then he turned those IPS cells into the motor neurons that actually were dying in the disease.
So basically what he did was to take a healthy cell and turn it into a sick cell, and he recapitulated the disease over and over again in the dish, and this was extraordinary, because it was the first time that we had a model of a disease from a living patient in living human cells.
And as he watched the disease unfold, he was able to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying in the disease in a different way than the field had previously thought. There was another kind of cell that actually was sending out a toxin and contributing to the death of these motor neurons, and you simply couldn't see it until you had the human model.
So you could really say that researchers trying to understand the cause of disease without being able to have human stem cell models were much like investigators trying to figure out what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash without having a black box, or a flight recorder.
They could hypothesize about what had gone wrong, but they really had no way of knowing what led to the terrible events.
And stem cells really have given us the black box for diseases, and it's an unprecedented window.
It really is extraordinary, because you can recapitulate many, many diseases in a dish, you can see what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation well before you would ever see symptoms appear in a patient.
And this opens up the ability, which hopefully will become something that is routine in the near term, of using human cells to test for drugs.
Right now, the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic.
To bring a successful drug to market, it takes, on average, 13 years — that's one drug — with a sunk cost of 4 billion dollars, and only one percent of the drugs that start down that road are actually going to get there.
You can't imagine other businesses that you would think of going into that have these kind of numbers.
It's a terrible business model.
But it is really a worse social model because of what's involved and the cost to all of us.
So the way we develop drugs now is by testing promising compounds on -- We didn't have disease modeling with human cells, so we'd been testing them on cells of mice or other creatures or cells that we engineer, but they don't have the characteristics of the diseases that we're actually trying to cure.
You know, we're not mice, and you can't go into a living person with an illness and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells and then start fooling around in a lab to test for, you know, a promising drug.
But what you can do with human stem cells, now, is actually create avatars, and you can create the cells, whether it's the live motor neurons or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells or other kinds of cells, and you can test for drugs, promising compounds, on the actual cells that you're trying to affect, and this is now, and it's absolutely extraordinary, and you're going to know at the beginning, the very early stages of doing your assay development and your testing, you're not going to have to wait 13 years until you've brought a drug to market, only to find out that actually it doesn't work, or even worse, harms people.
But it isn't really enough just to look at the cells from a few people or a small group of people, because we have to step back.
We've got to look at the big picture.
Look around this room. We are all different, and a disease that I might have, if I had Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, it probably would affect me differently than if one of you had that disease, and if we both had Parkinson's disease, and we took the same medication, but we had different genetic makeup, we probably would have a different result, and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully for me was actually ineffective for you, and similarly, it could be that a drug that is harmful for you is safe for me, and, you know, this seems totally obvious, but unfortunately it is not the way that the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs because, until now, it hasn't had the tools.
And so we need to move away from this one-size-fits-all model.
The way we've been developing drugs is essentially like going into a shoe store, no one asks you what size you are, or if you're going dancing or hiking.
They just say, "Well, you have feet, here are your shoes."
It doesn't work with shoes, and our bodies are many times more complicated than just our feet.
So we really have to change this.
There was a very sad example of this in the last decade.
There's a wonderful drug, and a class of drugs actually, but the particular drug was Vioxx, and for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain, the drug was an absolute lifesaver, but unfortunately, for another subset of those people, they suffered pretty severe heart side effects, and for a subset of those people, the side effects were so severe, the cardiac side effects, that they were fatal.
But imagine a different scenario, where we could have had an array, a genetically diverse array, of cardiac cells, and we could have actually tested that drug, Vioxx, in petri dishes, and figured out, well, okay, people with this genetic type are going to have cardiac side effects, people with these genetic subgroups or genetic shoes sizes, about 25,000 of them, are not going to have any problems.
The people for whom it was a lifesaver could have still taken their medicine.
The people for whom it was a disaster, or fatal, would never have been given it, and you can imagine a very different outcome for the company, who had to withdraw the drug.
So that is terrific, and we thought, all right, as we're trying to solve this problem, clearly we have to think about genetics, we have to think about human testing, but there's a fundamental problem, because right now, stem cell lines, as extraordinary as they are, and lines are just groups of cells, they are made by hand, one at a time, and it takes a couple of months.
This is not scalable, and also when you do things by hand, even in the best laboratories, you have variations in techniques, and you need to know, if you're making a drug, that the Aspirin you're going to take out of the bottle on Monday is the same as the Aspirin that's going to come out of the bottle on Wednesday.
So we looked at this, and we thought, okay, artisanal is wonderful in, you know, your clothing and your bread and crafts, but artisanal really isn't going to work in stem cells, so we have to deal with this.
But even with that, there still was another big hurdle, and that actually brings us back to the mapping of the human genome, because we're all different.
We know from the sequencing of the human genome that it's shown us all of the A's, C's, G's and T's that make up our genetic code, but that code, by itself, our DNA, is like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code without having a computer that can read it.
It's like having an app without having a smartphone.
We needed to have a way of bringing the biology to that incredible data, and the way to do that was to find a stand-in, a biological stand-in, that could contain all of the genetic information, but have it be arrayed in such a way as it could be read together and actually create this incredible avatar.
We need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub-types that represent who we are.
So this is what we've built.
It's an automated robotic technology.
It has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands of stem cell lines. It's genetically arrayed.
It has massively parallel processing capability, and it's going to change the way drugs are discovered, we hope, and I think eventually what's going to happen is that we're going to want to re-screen drugs, on arrays like this, that already exist, all of the drugs that currently exist, and in the future, you're going to be taking drugs and treatments that have been tested for side effects on all of the relevant cells, on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells.
It really has brought us to the threshold of personalized medicine.
It's here now, and in our family, my son has type 1 diabetes, which is still an incurable disease, and I lost my parents to heart disease and cancer, but I think that my story probably sounds familiar to you, because probably a version of it is your story.
At some point in our lives, all of us, or people we care about, become patients, and that's why I think that stem cell research is incredibly important for all of us.
Thank you.

<keywords>health care,medical research,science,technology</keywords>

I was raised in Seoul, Korea, and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.
I was pre-med at the time, and I thought I would become a surgeon because I was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.
At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.
I started to realize that I could look at the whole city as a living organism.
I wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers.
And the way to it, for me, was through artistic means.
So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.
and in grad school I became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.
In New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.
Most people ignore them or are frightened of them.
But I took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society.
And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives, they're also considered pests.
I also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them.
One day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two, and a man came up to me and said, "You can't take photographs here.
The MTA will confiscate your camera."
I was quite shocked by that, and thought to myself, "Well, OK then.
I'll follow the rats."
Then I started going into the tunnels, which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city that I never saw before and most people don't get to see.
Around the same time, I met like-minded individuals who call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers, guerrilla historians, etc.
I was welcomed into this loose, Internet-based network of people who regularly explore urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations, tunnels, sewers, aqueducts, factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on.
When I took photographs in these locations, I felt there was something missing in the pictures.
Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures wasn't enough for me.
So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself.
I decided against clothing because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time-specific elements.
I wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces.
This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.
It's now an empty, six-acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea.
I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned.
When I first went in, I was scared, because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.
But they happened to be wild dogs living there, and it was right by the water, so there were swans and ducks swimming around and trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels.
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.
And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature.
When I got comfortable in the space, it also felt like a big playground.
I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if I went back in time and became a child again.
This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct, which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.
The construction began in 1837.
It lasted about five years.
It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890.
When you go into spaces like this, you're directly accessing the past, because they sit untouched for decades.
I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.
Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home, you're actually feeling the hand-laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.
The murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991 when the tunnel reopened for trains.
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.
There's nobody around you, and you hear the kids playing in the park above you, completely unaware of what's underneath.
When I was going out a lot to these places, I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation because I was in a solitary phase in my life, and I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen," which references Charles Baudelaire.
"Naked City" is a nickname for New York, and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.
This is the same tunnel.
You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching.
This is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen.
I was there alone, setting up, and a homeless man approached.
I was basically intruding in his living space.
I was really frightened at first, but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project and he didn't seem to mind and so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer and ran back and forth.
And when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out.
It must have been a very unusual day for him.
One thing that struck me, after this incident, was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.
That homeless man, to me, really represented an element of the unconscious of the city.
He told me that he was abused above ground and was once in Riker's Island, and at last he found peace and quiet in that space.
The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city, but is now a sanctuary for outcasts, who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.
This is underneath my alma mater, Columbia University.
The tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the Manhattan Project.
This particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, which was demolished in 1890 when Columbia moved in.
This is the New York City Farm Colony, which was a poorhouse in Staten Island from the 1890s to the 1930s.
Most of my photos are set in places that have been abandoned for decades, but this is an exception.
This children's hospital was closed in 1997; it's located in Newark.
When I was there three years ago, the windows were broken and the walls were peeling, but everything was left there as it was.
You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines and even used utensils, which you see on the autopsy table.
After exploring recently-abandoned buildings, I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast: your home, your office, a shopping mall, a church -- any man-made structures around you.
I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly are.
I love to travel, and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.
It's full of history, and also full of underground bunkers and ruins from the war.
This was taken under a homeless asylum built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.
I saw the structure while I was on the train, and I got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb-like basement, which was used for ammunition storage during the war and also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.
This is the actual catacombs in Paris.
I explored there extensively in the off-limits areas and fell in love right away.
There are more than 185 miles of tunnels, and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.
The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century, the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats, so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place.
As you can see, the system is very complex and vast.
It's very dangerous to get lost in there.
And at the same time, there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.
So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries, making them into the catacombs.
The remains of over six million people are housed in there, some over 1,300 years old.
This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery where most of the ossuaries are located.
There are also phone cables that were used in the '50s and many bunkers from the World War II era.
This is a German bunker.
Nearby there's a French bunker, and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met.
The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance, which Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."
And I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.
After exploring the underground of Paris, I decided to climb up, and I climbed a Gothic monument that's right in the middle of Paris.
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques.
It was built in the early 1500s.
I don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January, naked.
It was not very comfortable.
And all this time, I never saw a single rat in any of these places, until recently, when I was in the London sewers.
This was probably the toughest place to explore.
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes -- I guess, except for in this picture.
And when the tides of waste matter come in it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.
This is a still from a film I worked on recently, called "Blind Door."
I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.
And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it.
And this is the first theater project I worked on.
I adapted and produced "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg.
It was performed last September one time only in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn, which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world, built in 1844.
I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.
But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series.
The last place I visited was the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras.
This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.
I like doing more than just exploring these spaces.
I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually in order to preserve their memories in a creative way -- before they're lost forever.
Thank you.

So, I'll start with this: a couple years ago, an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event.
And she called, and she said, "I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flier."
And I thought, "Well, what's the struggle?"
And she said, "Well, I saw you speak, and I'm going to call you a researcher, I think, but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come, because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant."
And she said, "But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller.
So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller."
And of course, the academic, insecure part of me was like, "You're going to call me a what?"
And she said, "I'm going to call you a storyteller."
And I was like, "Why not magic pixie?"
I was like, "Let me think about this for a second."
I tried to call deep on my courage.
And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller.
I'm a qualitative researcher.
I collect stories; that's what I do.
And maybe stories are just data with a soul.
And maybe I'm just a storyteller.
And so I said, "You know what?
Why don't you just say I'm a researcher-storyteller."
And she went, "Haha. There's no such thing."
So I'm a researcher-storyteller, and I'm going to talk to you today -- we're talking about expanding perception -- and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent.
And this is where my story starts.
When I was a young researcher, doctoral student, my first year I had a research professor who said to us, "Here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist."
And I thought he was just sweet-talking me.
I was like, "Really?" and he was like, "Absolutely."
And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's in social work, a master's in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the "life's messy, love it."
And I'm more of the, "life's messy, clean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box."
And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me -- really, one of the big sayings in social work is, "Lean into the discomfort of the work."
And I'm like, knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's.
That was my mantra.
So I was very excited about this.
And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me, because I am interested in some messy topics.
But I want to be able to make them not messy.
I want to understand them.
I want to hack into these things I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see.
So where I started was with connection.
Because, by the time you're a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection is why we're here.
It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives.
This is what it's all about.
It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice and mental health and abuse and neglect, what we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is -- neurobiologically that's how we're wired -- it's why we're here.
So I thought, you know what, I'm going to start with connection.
Well, you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss, and she tells you 37 things you do really awesome, and one thing -- an "opportunity for growth?"
And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right?
Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well, because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak.
When you ask people about belonging, they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded.
And when you ask people about connection, the stories they told me were about disconnection.
So very quickly -- really about six weeks into this research -- I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen.
And so I pulled back out of the research and thought, I need to figure out what this is.
And it turned out to be shame.
And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection?
The things I can tell you about it: it's universal; we all have it.
The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection.
No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it the more you have it.
What underpinned this shame, this "I'm not good enough," -- which we all know that feeling: "I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough."
The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability, this idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.
And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.
And so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick.
I'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out, I'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame, I'm going to understand how vulnerability works, and I'm going to outsmart it.
So I was ready, and I was really excited.
As you know, it's not going to turn out well.
You know this.
So, I could tell you a lot about shame, but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time.
But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to -- and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research.
My one year turned into six years: thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups.
At one point, people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories -- thousands of pieces of data in six years.
And I kind of got a handle on it.
I kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works.
I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay -- and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness -- that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness -- they have a strong sense of love and belonging -- and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough.
There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it.
And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging.
That's it.
They believe they're worthy.
And to me, the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection, was something that, personally and professionally, I felt like I needed to understand better.
So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way, and just looked at those.
What do these people have in common?
I have a slight office supply addiction, but that's another talk.
So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am I going to call this research?
And the first words that came to my mind were whole-hearted.
These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness.
So I wrote at the top of the manila folder, and I started looking at the data.
In fact, I did it first in a four-day very intensive data analysis, where I went back, pulled these interviews, pulled the stories, pulled the incidents.
What's the theme? What's the pattern?
My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing, where I'm just like writing and in my researcher mode.
And so here's what I found.
What they had in common was a sense of courage.
And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute.
Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the English language -- it's from the Latin word cor, meaning heart -- and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart.
And so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect.
They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others, because, as it turns out, we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly.
And the last was they had connection, and -- this was the hard part -- as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that for connection.
The other thing that they had in common was this: They fully embraced vulnerability.
They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful.
They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable, nor did they really talk about it being excruciating -- as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing.
They just talked about it being necessary.
They talked about the willingness to say, "I love you" first, the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees, the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram.
They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out.
They thought this was fundamental.
I personally thought it was betrayal.
I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job -- you know, the definition of research is to control and predict, to study phenomena, for the explicit reason to control and predict.
And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting.
This led to a little breakdown -- -- which actually looked more like this.
And it did.
I call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening.
A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown, but I assure you it was a breakdown.
And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist.
Let me tell you something: you know who you are when you call your friends and say, "I think I need to see somebody.
Do you have any recommendations?"
Because about five of my friends were like, "Wooo. I wouldn't want to be your therapist."
I was like, "What does that mean?"
And they're like, "I'm just saying, you know.
Don't bring your measuring stick."
I was like, "Okay."
So I found a therapist.
My first meeting with her, Diana -- I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down.
And she said, "How are you?"
And I said, "I'm great. I'm okay."
She said, "What's going on?"
And this is a therapist who sees therapists, because we have to go to those, because their B.S. meters are good.
And so I said, "Here's the thing, I'm struggling."
And she said, "What's the struggle?"
And I said, "Well, I have a vulnerability issue.
And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love.
And I think I have a problem, and I need some help."
And I said, "But here's the thing: no family stuff, no childhood shit."
"I just need some strategies."
Thank you.
So she goes like this.
And then I said, "It's bad, right?"
And she said, "It's neither good nor bad."
"It just is what it is."
And I said, "Oh my God, this is going to suck."
And it did, and it didn't.
And it took about a year.
And you know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important, that they surrender and walk into it.
that's not me, and B: I don't even hang out with people like that.
For me, it was a yearlong street fight.
It was a slugfest.
Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back.
I lost the fight, but probably won my life back.
And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted, what choices they were making, and what are we doing with vulnerability.
Why do we struggle with it so much?
Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability?
No.
So this is what I learned.
We numb vulnerability -- when we're waiting for the call.
It was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says, "How would you define vulnerability?
What makes you feel vulnerable?"
And within an hour and a half, I had 150 responses.
Because I wanted to know what's out there.
Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick, and we're newly married; initiating sex with my husband; initiating sex with my wife; being turned down; asking someone out; waiting for the doctor to call back; getting laid off; laying off people -- this is the world we live in.
We live in a vulnerable world.
And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability.
And I think there's evidence -- and it's not the only reason this evidence exists, but I think it's a huge cause -- we are the most in-debt, obese, addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history.
The problem is -- and I learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion.
You can't say, here's the bad stuff.
Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame, here's fear, here's disappointment.
I don't want to feel these.
I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.
I don't want to feel these.
And I know that's knowing laughter.
I hack into your lives for a living.
God.
You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects, our emotions.
You cannot selectively numb.
So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness.
And then we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.
And it becomes this dangerous cycle.
One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb.
And it doesn't just have to be addiction.
The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain.
Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty.
I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up.
That's it.
Just certain.
The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are, the more afraid we are.
This is what politics looks like today.
There's no discourse anymore.
There's no conversation.
There's just blame.
You know how blame is described in the research?
A way to discharge pain and discomfort.
We perfect.
If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me, but it doesn't work.
Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks.
Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, "Wow."
And we perfect, most dangerously, our children.
Let me tell you what we think about children.
They're hardwired for struggle when they get here.
And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand, our job is not to say, "Look at her, she's perfect.
My job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh grade."
That's not our job.
Our job is to look and say, "You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging."
That's our job.
Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we'll end the problems I think that we see today.
We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people.
We do that in our personal lives.
We do that corporate -- whether it's a bailout, an oil spill, a recall -- we pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people.
I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people.
We just need you to be authentic and real and say, "We're sorry.
We'll fix it."
But there's another way, and I'll leave you with this.
This is what I have found: to let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen; to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee -- and that's really hard, and I can tell you as a parent, that's excruciatingly difficult -- to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror, when we're wondering, "Can I love you this much?
Can I believe in this this passionately?
Can I be this fierce about this?"
just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, "I'm just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive."
And the last, which I think is probably the most important, is to believe that we're enough.
Because when we work from a place, I believe, that says, "I'm enough," then we stop screaming and start listening, we're kinder and gentler to the people around us, and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves.
That's all I have. Thank you.

This is our life with bees, and this is our life without bees.
Bees are the most important pollinators of our fruits and vegetables and flowers and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals.
More than one third of the world's crop production is dependent on bee pollination.
But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there pollinating our food intentionally.
They're out there because they need to eat.
Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet from pollen and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar.
They're flower-feeders, and as they move from flower to flower, basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart, they end up providing this valuable pollination service.
In parts of the world where there are no bees, or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees, people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand.
These people are moving pollen from flower to flower with a paintbrush.
Now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon.
Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand-held vibrator.
Now this one's the tomato tickler.
Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower, the anther, and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.
So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it, and they do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note C.
So they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it, and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh, and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body, and she takes it home as food.
Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pollination when it's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes.
So there's other, maybe more personal reasons, to care about bees.
There's over 20,000 species of bees in the world, and they're absolutely gorgeous.
These bees spend the majority of their life cycle hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem and very few of these beautiful species have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees.
Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative for the other 19,900-plus species because there's something about honeybees that draws people into their world.
Humans have been drawn to honeybees since early recorded history, mostly to harvest their honey, which is an amazing natural sweetener.
I got drawn into the honeybee world completely by a fluke.
I was 18 years old and bored, and I picked up a book in the library on bees and I spent the night reading it.
I had never thought about insects living in complex societies.
It was like the best of science fiction come true.
And even stranger, there were these people, these beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family, and when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself.
So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper, a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico.
And I was permanently hooked.
Honeybees can be considered a super-organism, where the colony is the organism and it's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000 individual bee organisms.
Now this society has no central authority.
Nobody's in charge.
So how they come to collective decisions, and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor, how they communicate where the flowers are, all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing.
My personal favorite, and one that I've studied for many years, is their system of healthcare.
So bees have social healthcare.
So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy.
For example, we study hygiene, where some bees are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest, from the colony, and it keeps the colony healthy.
And more recently, we've been studying resins that bees collect from plants.
So bees fly to some plants and they scrape these very, very sticky resins off the leaves, and they take them back to the nest where they cement them into the nest architecture where we call it propolis.
We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant.
It's a natural antibiotic.
It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony, and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity.
Humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times.
We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies for human medicine, but we didn't know how good it was for the bees.
So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving for over 50 million years.
So seven years ago, when honeybee colonies were reported to be dying en masse, first in the United States, it was clear that there was something really, really wrong.
In our collective conscience, in a really primal way, we know we can't afford to lose bees.
So what's going on?
Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes, and I'll go through each of these.
The bottom line is, bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape and a dysfunctional food system.
Now we have the best data on honeybees, so I'll use them as an example.
In the United States, bees in fact have been in decline since World War II.
We have half the number of managed hives in the United States now compared to 1945.
We're down to about two million hives of bees, we think.
And the reason is, after World War II, we changed our farming practices.
We stopped planting cover crops.
We stopped planting clover and alfalfa, which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil, and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers.
Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees.
And after World War II, we started using herbicides to kill off the weeds in our farms.
Many of these weeds are flowering plants that bees require for their survival.
And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures.
Now we talk about food deserts, places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores.
The very farms that used to sustain bees are now agricultural food deserts, dominated by one or two plant species like corn and soybeans.
Since World War II, we have been systematically eliminating many of the flowering plants that bees need for their survival.
And these monocultures extend even to crops that are good for bees, like almonds.
Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies, hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination, and also because the pollen in an almond blossom is really high in protein. It's really good for bees.
Now, the scale of almond monoculture demands that most of our nation's bees, over 1.5 million hives of bees, be transported across the nation to pollinate this one crop.
And they're trucked in in semi-loads, and they must be trucked out, because after bloom, the almond orchards are a vast and flowerless landscape.
Bees have been dying over the last 50 years, and we're planting more crops that need them.
There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production that requires bee pollination.
And then there's pesticides.
After World War II, we started using pesticides on a large scale, and this became necessary because of the monocultures that put out a feast for crop pests.
Recently, researchers from Penn State University have started looking at the pesticide residue in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food, and they've found that every batch of pollen that a honeybee collects has at least six detectable pesticides in it, and this includes every class of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and even inert and unlabeled ingredients that are part of the pesticide formulation that can be more toxic than the active ingredient.
This small bee is holding up a large mirror.
How much is it going to take to contaminate humans?
One of these class of insecticides, the neonicontinoids, is making headlines around the world right now.
You've probably heard about it.
This is a new class of insecticides.
It moves through the plant so that a crop pest, a leaf-eating insect, would take a bite of the plant and get a lethal dose and die.
If one of these neonics, we call them, is applied in a high concentration, such as in this ground application, enough of the compound moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and the nectar, where a bee can consume, in this case, a high dose of this neurotoxin that makes the bee twitch and die.
In most agricultural settings, on most of our farms, it's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide, and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and nectar, and if a bee consumes this lower dose, either nothing happens or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented and she may not find her way home.
And on top of everything else, bees have their own set of diseases and parasites.
Public enemy number one for bees is this thing.
It's called varroa destructor.
It's aptly named.
It's this big, blood-sucking parasite that compromises the bee's immune system and circulates viruses.
Let me put this all together for you.
I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it, and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus, but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu, and I know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition.
But what if I lived in a food desert?
And what if I had to travel a long distance to get to the grocery store, and I finally got my weak body out there and I consumed, in my food, enough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin, that I couldn't find my way home?
And this is what we mean by multiple and interacting causes of death.
And it's not just our honeybees.
All of our beautiful wild species of bees are at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees.
These bees are providing backup for our honeybees.
They're providing the pollination insurance alongside our honeybees.
We need all of our bees.
So what are we going to do?
What are we going to do about this big bee bummer that we've created?
It turns out, it's hopeful. It's hopeful.
Every one of you out there can help bees in two very direct and easy ways.
Plant bee-friendly flowers, and don't contaminate these flowers, this bee food, with pesticides.
So go online and search for flowers that are native to your area and plant them.
Plant them in a pot on your doorstep.
Plant them in your front yard, in your lawns, in your boulevards.
Campaign to have them planted in public gardens, community spaces, meadows.
Set aside farmland.
We need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season, from spring to fall.
We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees, but also for migrating butterflies and birds and other wildlife.
And we need to think carefully about putting back in cover crops to nourish our soil and nourish our bees.
And we need to diversify our farms.
We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows to disrupt the agricultural food desert and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system that we've created.
So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure to a big, huge problem -- just go plant flowers -- but when bees have access to good nutrition, we have access to good nutrition through their pollination services.
And when bees have access to good nutrition, they're better able to engage their own natural defenses, their healthcare, that they have relied on for millions of years.
So the beauty of helping bees this way, for me, is that every one of us needs to behave a little bit more like a bee society, an insect society, where each of our individual actions can contribute to a grand solution, an emergent property, that's much greater than the mere sum of our individual actions.
So let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large-scale change.
On behalf of the bees, thank you.
Thank you. Just a quick question.
The latest numbers on the die-off of bees, is there any sign of things bottoming out?
What's your hope/depression level on this?
Maria Spivak: Yeah.
At least in the United States, an average of 30 percent of all bee hives are lost every winter.
About 20 years ago, we were at a 15-percent loss.
So it's getting precarious.
That's not 30 percent a year, that's -- Yes, thirty percent a year.
Thirty percent a year. But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies and so they can maintain the same number, they can recuperate some of their loss.
We're kind of at a tipping point.
We can't really afford to lose that many more.
We need to be really appreciative of all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers.
Thank you.

<title>Marla Spivak: Why bees are disappearing</title>
<description>Honeybees have thrived for 50 million years, each colony 40 to 50,000 individuals coordinated in amazing harmony. So why, seven years ago, did colonies start dying en masse? Marla Spivak reveals four reasons which are interacting with tragic consequences. This is not simply a problem because bees pollinate a third of the world's crops. Could this incredible species be holding up a mirror for us?</description>

So I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys, and it's a serious problem with boys.
Their culture isn't working in schools, and I'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem.
First, I want to start by saying, this is a boy, and this is a girl, and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl.
If I essentialize gender for you today, then you can dismiss what I have to say.
So I'm not going to do that. I'm not interested in doing that.
This is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl.
So the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls, and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls.
But, in fact, most boys tend to be a certain way, and most girls tend to be a certain way.
And the point is that, for boys, the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn't working well in schools now.
How do we know that?
The Hundred Girls Project tells us some really nice statistics.
For example, for every 100 girls that are suspended from school, there are 250 boys that are suspended from school.
For every 100 girls who are expelled from school, there are 335 boys who are expelled from school.
For every 100 girls in special education, there are 217 boys.
For every 100 girls with a learning disability, there are 276 boys.
For every 100 girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed, we have 324 boys.
And by the way, all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black, if you happen to be poor, if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school.
And if you are a boy, you're four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD -- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
Now there is another side to this.
And it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school, that salaries are still significantly lower, even when controlled for job types, and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years.
That's all true.
Nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and 13.
And so we should.
In fact, what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook, because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic.
They've done a lot of good for girls in these situations, and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their younger years.
Even in their older years, what we find is that there's still a problem.
When we look at the universities, 60 percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now, which is a significant shift.
And in fact, university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to 70 percent female population in universities.
This makes university administrators very nervous, because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys.
And so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university.
If you talk to faculty, they may say, "Ugh. Yeah, well, they're playing video games, and they're gambling online all night long, and they're playing World of Warcraft, and that's affecting their academic achievement."
Guess what?
Video games are not the cause.
Video games are a symptom.
They were turned off a long time before they got here.
So let's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and 13.
There are three reasons that I believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today.
The first is zero tolerance.
A kindergarten teacher I know, her son donated all of his toys to her, and when he did, she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns.
You can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom.
What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun?
I mean, really.
But here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today.
Now I'm not advocating for bullies.
I'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives into school.
But when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it has to be suspended from school, I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance.
Another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys.
In a lot of classrooms today you're not allowed to write about anything that's violent.
You're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games -- these topics are banned.
Boy comes home from school, and he says, "I hate writing."
"Why do you hate writing, son? What's wrong with writing?"
"Now I have to write what she tells me to write."
"Okay, what is she telling you to write?"
"Poems. I have to write poems.
And little moments in my life.
I don't want to write that stuff."
"All right. Well, what do you want to write? What do you want to write about?"
"I want to write about video games. I want to write about leveling-up.
I want to write about this really interesting world.
I want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody."
"All right. Okay."
You tell a teacher that, and they'll ask you, in all seriousness, "Should we send this child to the psychologist?"
And the answer is no, he's just a boy.
He's just a little boy.
It's not okay to write these kinds of things in classrooms today.
So that's the first reason: zero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out.
The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures: there are fewer male teachers.
Anybody who's over 15 doesn't know what this means, because in the last 10 years, the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half.
We went from 14 percent to seven percent.
That means that 93 percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women.
Now what's the problem with this?
Women are great. Yep, absolutely.
But male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart -- they've got dads, they've got pastors, they've got Cub Scout leaders, but ultimately, six hours a day, five days a week they're spending in a classroom, and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist.
And so they say, I guess this really isn't a place for boys.
This is a place for girls.
And I'm not very good at this, so I guess I'd better go play video games or get into sports, or something like that, because I obviously don't belong here.
Men don't belong here, that's pretty obvious.
So that may be a very direct way that we see it happen.
But less directly, the lack of male presence in the culture -- you've got a teachers' lounge, and they're having a conversation about Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground.
"What are we going to do with these boys?"
The answer to that question changes depending on who's sitting around that table.
Are there men around that table?
Are there moms who've raised boys around that table?
You'll see, the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table.
Third reason that boys are out of sync with school today: kindergarten is the old second grade, folks.
We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there.
When you're three, you better be able to write your name legibly, or else we'll consider it a developmental delay.
By the time you're in first grade, you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture, maybe not, in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages.
If you don't, we're probably going to be putting you into a Title 1 special reading program.
And if you ask Title 1 teachers, they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program, in the elementary grades.
The reason that this is a problem is because the message that boys are getting is "you need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time."
The teacher's salary depends on "No Child Left Behind" and "Race to the Top" and accountability and testing and all of this.
So she has to figure out a way to get all these boys through this curriculum -- and girls.
This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids.
And what happens is, she says, "Please, sit down, be quiet, do what you're told, follow the rules, manage your time, focus, be a girl."
That's what she tells them.
Indirectly, that's what she tells them.
And so this is a very serious problem. Where is it coming from?
We want our babies to read when they are six months old.
Have you seen the ads?
We want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average, but what this does to our children is really not healthy.
It's not developmentally appropriate, and it's particularly bad for boys.
So what do we do?
We need to meet them where they are.
We need to put ourselves into boy culture.
We need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools.
More specifically, we can do some very specific things.
We can design better games.
Most of the educational games that are out there today are really flashcards.
They're glorified drill and practice.
They don't have the depth, the rich narrative that really engaging video games have, that the boys are really interested in.
So we need to design better games.
We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians.
We need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom.
We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies.
Do they make sense?
We need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can, trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them.
All of those conversations need to be happening.
There are some great examples out there of schools -- the New York Times just talked about a school recently.
A game designer from the New School put together a wonderful video gaming school.
But it only treats a few kids, and so this isn't very scalable.
We have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today.
We need to find more money for game design.
Because good games, really good games, cost money, and World of Warcraft has quite a budget.
Most of the educational games do not.
Where we started: my colleagues -- Mike Petner, Shawn Vashaw, myself -- we started by trying to look at the teachers' attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming, what do they say about it.
And we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school, who talk about gaming, in pretty demeaning ways.
They say, "Oh, yeah. They're always talking about that stuff.
They're talking about their little action figures and their little achievements or merit badges, or whatever it is that they get.
And they're always talking about this stuff."
And they say these things as if it's okay.
But if it were your culture, think of how that might feel.
It's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language.
They're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies.
They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything.
So we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways to change the attitudes so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms.
Because, ultimately, if we don't, then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying, "Well I guess that was just a place for girls.
It wasn't for me.
So I've got to do gaming, or I've got to do sports."
If we change these things, if we pay attention to these things, and we re-engage boys in their learning, they will leave the elementary schools saying, "I'm smart."
Thank you.

<title>Ali Carr-Chellman: Gaming to re-engage boys in learning</title>
<description>In her talk, Ali Carr-Chellman pinpoints three reasons boys are tuning out of school in droves, and lays out her bold plan to re-engage them: bringing their culture into the classroom, with new rules that let boys be boys, and video games that teach as well as entertain. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>
<keywords>children,education,gaming,psychology,technology,violence</keywords>

I love paper, and I love technology, and what I do is I make paper interactive.
And that's what I say when people ask me what I do, but it really confuses most people, so really, the best way for me to convey it is to take the technology and be creative and create experiences.
So I tried to think what I could use for here, and a couple of weeks ago I had a crazy idea that I wanted to print two DJ decks and to try and mix some music.
And I'm going to try and show that at the end, and the suspense will be as much mine if it works.
And I'm not a DJ, and I'm not a musician, so I'm a little bit scared of that.
So I think, I found the best way to describe my journey is just to mention a few little things that have happened to me throughout my life.
There's three particular things that I've done, and I'll just describe those first, and then talk about some of my work.
So when I was a kid, I was obsessed with wires, and I used to thread them under my carpet and thread them behind the walls and have little switches and little speakers, and I wanted to make my bedroom be interactive but kind of all hidden away.
And I was also really interested in wireless as well.
So I bought one of those little kits that you could get to make a radio transmitter, and I got an old book and I carved out the inside and I hid it inside there, and then I placed it next to my dad and snuck back to my bedroom and tuned in on the radio so I could eavesdrop.
I was not at all interested in what he was saying.
It's more that I just liked the idea of an everyday object having something inside and doing something different.
Several year later, I managed to successfully fail all of my exams and didn't really leave school with much to show for at all, and my parents, maybe as a reward, bought me what turned out to be a one-way ticket to Australia, and I came back home about four years later.
I ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere.
It was in far western New South Wales.
And this farm was 120,000 acres.
There were 22,000 sheep, and it was about 40 degrees, or 100 or so Fahrenheit.
And on this farm there was the farmer, his wife, and there was the four-year-old daughter.
And they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work.
Obviously, one of the most important things was the sheep, and so my job was, well, pretty much to do everything, but it was about bringing the sheep back to the homestead.
And we'd do that by building fences, using motorbikes and horses, and the sheep would make their way all the way back to the shearing shed for the different seasons.
And what I learned was, although at the time, like everyone else, I thought sheep were pretty stupid because they didn't do what we wanted them to do, what I realize now, probably only just in the last few weeks looking back, is the sheep weren't stupid at all.
We'd put them in an environment where they didn't want to be, and they didn't want to do what we wanted them to do.
So the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by listening to the weather, the lay of the land, and creating things that would let the sheep flow and go where we wanted them to go.
Another bunch of years later, I ended up at Cambridge University at the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K.
doing a Ph.D. in physics.
My Ph.D. was to move electrons around, one at a time.
And I realize — again, it's kind of these realizations looking back as to what I did — I realize now that it was pretty much the same as moving sheep around.
It really is.
It's just you do it by changing an environment.
And that's kind of been a big lesson to me, that you can't act on any object.
You change its environment, and the object will flow.
So we made it very small, so things were about 30 nanometers in size; making it very cold, so at liquid helium temperatures; and changing environment by changing the voltage, and the electrons could make flow around a loop one at a time, on and off, a little memory node.
And I wanted to go one step further, and I wanted to move one electron on and one electron off.
And I was told that I wouldn't be able to do this, which, you know, as we've heard from other people, that's the thing that makes you do it.
And I was determined, and I managed to show that I could do that.
And a lot of that learning, I think, came from being on that farm, because when I was working on the farm, we'd have to use what was around us, we'd have to use the environment, and there was no such thing as something can't be done, because you're in an environment where, if you can't do what you need to do, you can die, and, you know, I had seen that sort of thing happen.
So now my obsession is printing, and I'm really fascinated by the idea of using conventional printing processes, so the types of print that are used to create many of the things around us to make paper and card interactive.
When I spoke to some printers when I started doing this and told them what I wanted to do, which was to print conductive inks onto paper, they told me it couldn't be done, again, that kind of favorite thing.
So I got about 10 credit cards and loans and got myself very close to bankruptcy, really, and bought myself this huge printing press, which I had no idea how to use at all.
It was about five meters long, and I covered myself and the floor with ink and made a massive mess, but I learned to print.
And then I took it back to the printers and showed them what I've done, and they were like, "Of course you can do that.
Why didn't you come here in the first place?"
That's always the case.
So what we do is we take conventional printing presses, we make conductive inks, and run those through a press, and basically just letting hundreds of thousands of electrons flow through pieces of paper so we can make that paper interactive.
And it's pretty simple, really.
It's just a collection of things that have been done before, but bringing them together in a different way.
So we have a piece of paper with conductive ink on, and then add onto that a small circuit board with a couple of chips, one to run some capacitive touch software, so we know where we've touched it, and the other to run, quite often, some wireless software so the piece of paper can connect.
So I'll just describe a couple of things that we've created.
There's lots of different things we've created.
This is one of them, because I love cake.
And this one, it's a large poster, and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it, and the poster talks to you when you touch it and asks you a series of questions, and it works out your perfect cake.
But it doesn't tell you the cake there and then.
It uploads a picture, and the reason why it chose that cake for you, to our Facebook page and to Twitter.
So we're trying to create that connection between the physical and the digital, but have it not looking on a screen, and just looking like a regular poster.
We've worked with a bunch of universities on a project looking at interactive newsprint.
So for example, we've created a newspaper, a regular newspaper.
You can wear a pair of headphones that are connected to it wirelessly, and when you touch it, you can hear the music that's described on the top, which is something you can't read.
You can hear a press conference as well as reading what the editor has determined that press conference was about.
And you can press a Facebook "like" button or you can vote on something as well.
Something else that we created, and this was an idea that I had a couple of years ago, and so we've done a project on this.
It was for funding from the government for user-centered design for energy-efficient buildings, difficult to say, and something I had no idea what it was when I went into the workshop, but quickly learned.
And we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better.
And I really liked the idea that, instead of looking at dials and reading things to say -- looking at your energy usage, I wanted to create a poster that was wirelessly connected and had color-changing inks on it, and so if your energy usage was trending better, than the leaves would appear and the rabbits would appear and all would be good.
And if it wasn't, then there'd be graffiti and the leaves would fall off the trees.
So it was trying to make you look after something in your immediate environment, which you don't want to see not looking so good, rather than expecting people to do things in the local environment because of the effect that it has a long way off.
And I think, kind of like going back to the farm, it's about how to let people do what you want them to do rather than making people do what you want them to do.
Okay.
So this is the bit I'm really scared of.
So a couple of things I've created are, there's a poster over here that you can play drums on.
And I am not a musician. It seemed like a good idea at the time.
If anyone wants to try and play drums, then they can.
I'll just describe how this works.
This poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone, and when you touch it, it connects to the app.
And it has really good response time.
It's using Bluetooth 4, so it's pretty instantaneous.
Okay. Thanks.
And there's a couple of other things.
So this one is like a sound board, so you can touch it, and I just love these horrible noises.
Okay, and this is a D.J. turntable.
So it's wirelessly linked to my iPad, and this is a software that's running on the iPad.
Oh, yes. I just love doing that.
I'm not a D.J., though, but I just always wanted to do that.
So I have a crossfader, and I have the two decks.
So I've made some new technology, and I love things being creative, and I love working with creative people.
So my 15-year-old niece, she's amazing, and she's called Charlotte, and I asked her to record something, and I worked with a friend called Elliot to put some beats together.
So this is my niece, Charlotte.
Yay!
So that's pretty much what I do.
I just love bringing technology together, having a lot of fun, being creative.
But it's not about the technology.
It's just about, I want to create some great experiences.
So thank you very much.

What is it about flying cars?
We've wanted to do this for about a hundred years.
And there are historic attempts that have had some level of technical success.
But we haven't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really, truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us -- that, I don't know about you, but I really enjoy spending time in.
We looked at the historical attempts that had been out there and realized that, despite the fact that we have a lot of modern innovations to draw on today that weren't available previously -- we have modern composite materials, we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy and have better power-to-rate ratios than have ever been available, we have glass cockpit avionics that bring the information you need to fly directly to you in the cockpit -- but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective, we realized that we were going to be getting the same result that people had been getting for the last hundred years, which isn't where we want to be right now.
So instead of trying to make a car that can fly, we decided to try to make a plane that could drive.
And the result is the Terrafugia Transition.
It's a two-seat, single-engine airplane that works just like any other small airplane.
You take off and land at a local airport.
Then once you're on the ground, you fold up the wings, drive it home, park it in your garage.
And it works.
After two years of an innovative design and construction process, the proof of concept made its public debut in 2008.
Now like with anything that's really different from the status quo, it didn't always go so well testing that aircraft.
And we discovered that it's a very good thing that, when you go home with something that's been broken, you've actually learned a lot more than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives the first time through.
Still, we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we'd all helped build in the air, off the ground, like it was supposed to be.
And on our third high-speed testing deployment on a bitter cold morning in upstate New York, we got to do that for the first time.
The picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time.
And we were all very flattered to see that image become a symbol of accomplishing something that people had thought was impossible really the world over.
The flight testing that followed that was as basic and low-risk as we could make it, but it still accomplished what we needed to to take the program to the next step and to gain the credibility that we needed within our eventual market, the general aviation community, and with the regulators that govern the use of design of aircraft, particularly in the States.
The FAA, about a year ago, gave us an exemption for the Transition to allow us to have an additional 110 lbs.
within the light sport aircraft category.
Now that doesn't sound like a lot, but it's very important, because being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it, but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it.
A sport pilot can be certificated in as little as 20 hours of flight time.
And at 110 lbs., that's very important for solving the other side of the equation -- driving.
It turns out that driving, with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles, is actually a harder problem to solve than flying.
For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground, this may be counter-intuitive, but driving has potholes, cobblestones, pedestrians, other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with.
Fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features.
We have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car.
Now this also, as good as it is, wasn't quite enough.
The regulations for vehicles on the road weren't written with an airplane in mind.
So we did need a little bit of support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Now you may have seen in the news recently, they came through with us at the end of last month with a few special exemptions that will allow the Transition to be sold in the same category as SUVs and light trucks.
As a multi-purpose passenger vehicle, it is now officially "designed for occasional off-road use."
Now let's see it in action.
You can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane.
You're not powering the propeller, you're powering the wheels.
And it is under seven feet tall, so it will fit in a standard construction garage.
And that's the automated wing-folding mechanism.
That's real time.
You just push a few buttons in the cockpit, and the wings come out.
Once they're fully deployed, there's a mechanical lock that goes into place, again, from inside the cockpit.
And they're now fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight -- just like putting down your convertible top.
And you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.
Test Pilot: Until the vehicle flies, 75 percent of your risk is that first flight.
Radio: It actually flew. Yes.
Radio 2: That was gorgeous.
Radio: What did you think of that?
That was beautiful from up here, I tell you.
AMD: See, we're all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop.
And our test pilot gave us the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight, which was that it was "remarkably unremarkable."
He would go onto tell us that the Transition had been the easiest airplane to land that he'd flown in his entire 30-year career as a test pilot.
So despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary, we really focused on doing as little new as possible.
We leverage a lot of technology from the state-of-the-art in general aviation and from automotive racing.
When we do have to do something truly out-of-the-box, we use an incremental design, build, test, redesign cycle that lets us reduce risk in baby steps.
Now since we started Terrafugia about 6 years ago, we've had a lot of those baby steps.
We've gone from being three of us working in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate school to about two-dozen of us working in an initial production facility outside of Boston.
We've had to overcome challenges like keeping the weight below the light sport limit that I talked about, figuring out how to politely respond when a regulator tells you, "But that won't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended -- to all of the other associated durability and engineering issues that we talked about on the ground.
Still, if everything goes to our satisfaction with the testing and construction of the two production prototypes that we're working on right now, those first deliveries to the, about a hundred, people who have reserved an airplane at this point should begin at the end of next year.
The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes.
And I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy, but I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane.
Here's why.
While nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports, there is a huge underutilized resource out there.
There are thousands of local airstrips that don't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could.
On average, there's one within 20 to 30 miles of wherever you are in the United States.
The Transition gives you a safer, more convenient and more fun way of using this resource.
For those of you who aren't yet pilots, there's four main reasons why those of us who are don't fly as much as we'd like to: the weather, primarily, cost, long door-to-door travel time and mobility at your destination.
Now, bad weather comes in, just land, fold up the wings, drive home.
Doesn't matter if it rains a little, you have a windshield wiper.
Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger, park it in your garage.
And the unleaded automotive fuel that we use is both cheaper and better for the environment than traditional avgas.
Door-to-door travel time is reduced, because now, instead of lugging bags, finding a parking space, taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger, you're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go.
And mobility to your destination is clearly solved.
Just fold up the wings and keep going.
The Transition simultaneously expands our horizons while making the world a smaller, more accessible place.
It also continues to be a fabulous adventure.
I hope you'll each take a moment to think about how you could use something like this to give yourself more access to your own world, and to make your own travel more convenient and more fun.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you.

<description>A flying car -- it's an iconic image of the future. But after 100 years of flight and automotive engineering, no one has really cracked the problem. Pilot Anna Mracek Dietrich and her team flipped the question, asking: Why not build a plane that you can drive?</description>

Cultural evolution is a dangerous child for any species to let loose on its planet.
By the time you realize what's happening, the child is a toddler, up and causing havoc, and it's too late to put it back.
We humans are Earth's Pandoran species.
We're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box, and we can't push it back in.
We're seeing the consequences all around us.
Now that, I suggest, is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously.
And it gives us a new way of thinking about not only what's going on on our planet, but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos.
So first of all, I'd like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes, and secondly, how this might answer questions about who's out there, if indeed anyone is.
So, memetics: memetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism.
Darwin had this amazing idea.
Indeed, some people say it's the best idea anybody ever had.
Isn't that a wonderful thought, that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had?
Do you think there could?
Susan Blackmore: Someone says no, very loudly, from over there.
Well, I say yes, and if there is, I give the prize to Darwin.
Why?
Because the idea was so simple, and yet it explains all design in the universe.
I would say not just biological design, but all of the design that we think of as human design.
It's all just the same thing happening.
What did Darwin say?
I know you know the idea, natural selection, but let me just paraphrase "The Origin of Species," 1859, in a few sentences.
What Darwin said was something like this: if you have creatures that vary, and that can't be doubted -- I've been to the Galapagos, and I've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on, and so on.
And 100 pages later.
And if there is a struggle for life, such that nearly all of these creatures die -- and this can't be doubted, I've read Malthus and I've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted, and so on and so on.
And another 100 pages later.
And if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring whatever it was that helped them survive, then those offspring must be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were.
You see the idea?
If, if, if, then.
He had no concept of the idea of an algorithm, but that's what he described in that book, and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm.
The principle is you just need those three things -- variation, selection and heredity.
And as Dan Dennett puts it, if you have those, then you must get evolution.
Or design out of chaos, without the aid of mind.
There's one word I love on that slide.
What do you think my favorite word is?
SB: Chaos? No. What? Mind? No.
SB: No, not without.
You try them all in order: Mmm...?
SB: Must, at must. Must, must.
This is what makes it so amazing.
You don't need a designer, or a plan, or foresight, or anything else.
If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere.
You can't stop it.
Must is my favorite word there.
Now, what's this to do with memes?
Well, the principle here applies to anything that is copied with variation and selection.
We're so used to thinking in terms of biology, we think about genes this way.
Darwin didn't, of course; he didn't know about genes.
He talked mostly about animals and plants, but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct.
But the principle of Universal Darwinism is that any information that is varied and selected will produce design.
And this is what Richard Dawkins was on about in his 1976 bestseller, "The Selfish Gene."
The information that is copied, he called the replicator.
It selfishly copies.
Not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going, "I want to get copied."
But that it will get copied if it can, regardless of the consequences.
It doesn't care about the consequences because it can't, because it's just information being copied.
And he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes, and so he said, "Is there another replicator out there on the planet?"
Ah, yes, there is.
Look around you -- here will do, in this room.
All around us, still clumsily drifting about in its primeval soup of culture, is another replicator.
Information that we copy from person to person, by imitation, by language, by talking, by telling stories, by wearing clothes, by doing things.
This is information copied with variation and selection.
This is design process going on.
He wanted a name for the new replicator.
So, he took the Greek word "mimeme," which means that which is imitated.
Remember that, that's the core definition: that which is imitated.
And abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good and made a good meme, an effective spreading meme.
So that's how the idea came about.
It's important to stick with that definition.
The whole science of memetics is much maligned, much misunderstood, much feared.
But a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition.
A meme is not equivalent to an idea.
It's not an idea. It's not equivalent to anything else, really.
Stick with the definition.
It's that which is imitated, or information which is copied from person to person.
So, let's see some memes.
Well, you sir, you've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way.
I wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself, or copied it from someone else?
If you copied it from someone else, it's a meme.
And what about, oh, I can't see any interesting memes here.
All right everyone, who's got some interesting memes for me?
Oh, well, your earrings, I don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings.
You probably went out and bought them.
There are plenty more in the shops.
That's something that's passed on from person to person.
All the stories that we're telling -- well, of course, TED is a great meme-fest, masses of memes.
The way to think about memes, though, is to think, why do they spread?
They're selfish information, they will get copied, if they can.
But some of them will be copied because they're good, or true, or useful, or beautiful.
Some of them will be copied even though they're not.
Some, it's quite hard to tell why.
There's one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy.
And I'm glad to say, as I expected, I found it when I came here, and I'm sure all of you found it, too.
You go to your nice, posh, international hotel somewhere, and you come in and you put down your clothes and you go to the bathroom, and what do you see?
SB: Pardon?
SB: Soap, yeah. What else do you see?
Audience: SB: Mmm mmm.
SB: Sink, toilet, yes, these are all memes, they're all memes, but they're sort of useful ones, and then there's this one.
What is this one doing?
This has spread all over the world.
It's not surprising that you all found it when you arrived in your bathrooms here.
But I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco-camp in the jungle in Assam.
Who folded that thing up there, and why?
Some people get carried away.
Other people are just lazy and make mistakes.
Some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker.
What is this all about?
I suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's cleaned the place, and it's all lovely.
And you know, actually, all it tells you is that another person has potentially spread germs from place to place.
So, think of it this way.
Imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes.
The memes are all trying to get copied -- trying, in inverted commas -- i.e., that's the shorthand for, if they can get copied, they will.
They're using you and me as their propagating, copying machinery, and we are the meme machines.
Now, why is this important?
Why is this useful, or what does it tell us?
It gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human, all conventional theories of cultural evolution, of the origin of humans, and what makes us so different from other species.
All other theories explaining the big brain, and language, and tool use and all these things that make us unique, are based upon genes.
Language must have been useful for the genes.
Tool use must have enhanced our survival, mating and so on.
It always comes back, as Richard Dawkins complained all that long time ago, it always comes back to genes.
The point of memetics is to say, "Oh no, it doesn't."
There are two replicators now on this planet.
From the moment that our ancestors, perhaps two and a half million years ago or so, began imitating, there was a new copying process.
Copying with variation and selection.
A new replicator was let loose, and it could never be -- right from the start -- it could never be that human beings who let loose this new creature, could just copy the useful, beautiful, true things, and not copy the other things.
While their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy -- lighting fires, keeping fires going, new techniques of hunting, these kinds of things -- inevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair, or wearing strange clothes, or painting their faces, or whatever.
So, you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and not waste their time copying all this stuff, and the memes themselves, like the sounds that people made and copied -- in other words, what turned out to be language -- competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger.
So, the big brain, on this theory, is driven by the memes.
This is why, in "The Meme Machine," I called it memetic drive.
As the memes evolve, as they inevitably must, they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes that are doing the driving.
This is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains, that we like religion, and music, and art.
Language is a parasite that we've adapted to, not something that was there originally for our genes, on this view.
And like most parasites, it can begin dangerous, but then it coevolves and adapts, and we end up with a symbiotic relationship with this new parasite.
And so, from our perspective, we don't realize that that's how it began.
So, this is a view of what humans are.
All other species on this planet are gene machines only, they don't imitate at all well, hardly at all.
We alone are gene machines and meme machines as well.
The memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine.
But that's not all.
We have a new kind of memes now.
I've been wondering for a long time, since I've been thinking about memes a lot, is there a difference between the memes that we copy -- the words we speak to each other, the gestures we copy, the human things -- and all these technological things around us?
I have always, until now, called them all memes, but I do honestly think now we need a new word for technological memes.
Let's call them techno-memes or temes.
Because the processes are getting different.
We began, perhaps 5,000 years ago, with writing.
We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet, but in order to get true temes and true teme machines, you need to get the variation, the selection and the copying, all done outside of humans.
And we're getting there.
We're at this extraordinary point where we're nearly there, that there are machines like that.
And indeed, in the short time I've already been at TED, I see we're even closer than I thought we were before.
So actually, now the temes are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines.
Our children are growing up very quickly learning to read, learning to use machinery.
We're going to have all kinds of implants, drugs that force us to stay awake all the time.
We'll think we're choosing these things, but the temes are making us do it.
So, we're at this cusp now of having a third replicator on our planet.
Now, what about what else is going on out there in the universe?
Is there anyone else out there?
People have been asking this question for a long time.
We've been asking it here at TED already.
In 1961, Frank Drake made his famous equation, but I think he concentrated on the wrong things.
It's been very productive, that equation.
He wanted to estimate N, the number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy, and he included in there the rate of star formation, the rate of planets, but crucially, intelligence.
I think that's the wrong way to think about it.
Intelligence appears all over the place, in all kinds of guises.
Human intelligence is only one kind of a thing.
But what's really important is the replicators you have and the levels of replicators, one feeding on the one before.
So, I would suggest that we don't think intelligence, we think replicators.
And on that basis, I've suggested a different kind of equation.
A very simple equation.
N, the same thing, the number of communicative civilizations out there [that] we might expect in our galaxy.
Just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy.
The fraction of those which get a first replicator.
The fraction of those that get the second replicator.
The fraction of those that get the third replicator.
Because it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out -- sending information, sending probes, getting out there, and communicating with anywhere else.
OK, so if we take that equation, why haven't we heard from anybody out there?
Because every step is dangerous.
Getting a new replicator is dangerous.
You can pull through, we have pulled through, but it's dangerous.
Take the first step, as soon as life appeared on this earth.
We may take the Gaian view.
I loved Peter Ward's talk yesterday -- it's not Gaian all the time.
Actually, life forms produce things that kill themselves.
Well, we did pull through on this planet.
But then, a long time later, billions of years later, we got the second replicator, the memes.
That was dangerous, all right.
Think of the big brain.
How many mothers do we have here?
You know all about big brains.
They are dangerous to give birth to, are agonizing to give birth to.
My cat gave birth to four kittens, purring all the time.
Ah, mm -- slightly different.
But not only is it painful, it kills lots of babies, it kills lots of mothers, and it's very expensive to produce.
The genes are forced into producing all this myelin, all the fat to myelinate the brain.
Do you know, sitting here, your brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output for two percent of your body weight?
It's a really expensive organ to run.
Why? Because it's producing the memes.
Now, it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off, and maybe it nearly did, but you see, we don't know.
But maybe it nearly did.
Has it been tried before?
What about all those other species?
Louise Leakey talked yesterday about how we're the only one in this branch left.
What happened to the others?
Could it be that this experiment in imitation, this experiment in a second replicator, is dangerous enough to kill people off?
Well, we did pull through, and we adapted.
But now, we're hitting, as I've just described, we're hitting the third replicator point.
And this is even more dangerous -- well, it's dangerous again.
Why? Because the temes are selfish replicators and they don't care about us, or our planet, or anything else.
They're just information, why would they?
They are using us to suck up the planet's resources to produce more computers, and more of all these amazing things we're hearing about here at TED.
Don't think, "Oh, we created the Internet for our own benefit."
That's how it seems to us.
Think, temes spreading because they must.
We are the old machines.
Now, are we going to pull through?
What's going to happen?
What does it mean to pull through?
Well, there are kind of two ways of pulling through.
One that is obviously happening all around us now, is that the temes turn us into teme machines, with these implants, with the drugs, with us merging with the technology.
And why would they do that?
Because we are self-replicating.
We have babies.
We make new ones, and so it's convenient to piggyback on us, because we're not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable.
Although it's closer, I heard this morning, it's closer than I thought it was.
Where the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves.
That way, it wouldn't matter if the planet's climate was utterly destabilized, and it was no longer possible for humans to live here.
Because those teme machines, they wouldn't need -- they're not squishy, wet, oxygen-breathing, warmth-requiring creatures.
They could carry on without us.
So, those are the two possibilities.
The second, I don't think we're that close.
It's coming, but we're not there yet.
The first, it's coming too.
But the damage that is already being done to the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is, that third danger point, getting a third replicator.
And will we get through this third danger point, like we got through the second and like we got through the first?
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
I have no idea.
That was an incredible talk.
SB: Thank you. I scared myself.

When I go to parties, it doesn't usually take very long for people to find out that I'm a scientist and I study sex.
And then I get asked questions.
And the questions usually have a very particular format.
They start with the phrase, "A friend told me," and then they end with the phrase, "Is this true?"
And most of the time I'm glad to say that I can answer them, but sometimes I have to say, "I'm really sorry, but I don't know because I'm not that kind of a doctor."
That is, I'm not a clinician, I'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy.
And my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work when everything's going right, rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong, like so many of you.
And what I do is I look for similarities and differences in the solutions that they've evolved for fundamental biological problems.
So today I'm here to argue that this is not at all an esoteric Ivory Tower activity that we find at our universities, but that broad study across species, tissue types and organ systems can produce insights that have direct implications for human health.
And this is true both of my recent project on sex differences in the brain, and my more mature work on the anatomy and function of penises.
And now you know why I'm fun at parties.
So today I'm going to give you an example drawn from my penis study to show you how knowledge drawn from studies of one organ system provided insights into a very different one.
Now I'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows -- I did have to explain it to my nine-year-old late last week -- penises are structures that transfer sperm from one individual to another.
And the slide behind me barely scratches the surface of how widespread they are in animals.
There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation.
You find muscular tubes, modified legs, modified fins, as well as the mammalian fleshy, inflatable cylinder that we're all familiar with -- or at least half of you are.
And I think we see this tremendous variation because it's a really effective solution to a very basic biological problem, and that is getting sperm in a position to meet up with eggs and form zygotes.
Now the penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion, but when internal fertilization evolves, penises often follow.
And the question I get when I start talking about this most often is, "What made you interested in this subject?"
And the answer is skeletons.
You wouldn't think that skeletons and penises have very much to do with one another.
And that's because we tend to think of skeletons as stiff lever systems that produce speed or power.
And my first forays into biological research, doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate, were really squarely in that realm.
But when I went to graduate school to study biomechanics, I really wanted to find a dissertation project that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function.
I tried a bunch of different stuff.
A lot of it didn't pan out.
But then one day I started thinking about the mammalian penis.
And it's really an odd sort of structure.
Before it can be used for internal fertilization, its mechanical behavior has to change in a really dramatic fashion.
Most of the time it's a flexible organ.
It's easy to bend.
But before it's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid, it has to become difficult to bend.
And moreover, it has to work.
A reproductive system that fails to function produces an individual that has no offspring, and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool.
And so I thought, "Here's a problem that just cries out for a skeletal system -- not one like this one, but one like this one -- because, functionally, a skeleton is any system that supports tissue and transmits forces.
And I already knew that animals like this earthworm, indeed most animals, don't support their tissues by draping them over bones.
Instead they're more like reinforced water balloons.
They use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton.
And a hydrostatic skeleton uses two elements.
The skeletal support comes from an interaction between a pressurized fluid and a surrounding wall of tissue that's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins.
And the interaction is crucial.
Without both elements you have no support.
If you have fluid with no wall to surround it and keep pressure up, you have a puddle.
And if you have just the wall with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension, you've got a little wet rag.
When you look at a penis in cross section, it has a lot of the hallmarks of a hydrostatic skeleton.
It has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid -- in this case blood -- surrounded by a wall of tissue that's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen.
But at the time when I started this project, the best explanation I could find for penal erection was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues, and the spongy tissues filled with blood and pressure rose and voila! it became erect.
And that explained to me expansion -- made sense: more fluid, you get tissues that expand -- but it didn't actually explain erection.
Because there was no mechanism in this explanation for making this structure hard to bend.
And no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue.
So I thought, wall tissue's important in skeletons.
It has to be part of the explanation.
And this was the point at which my graduate adviser said, "Whoa! Hold on. Slow down."
Because after about six months of me talking about this, I think he finally figured out that I was really serious about the penis thing.
So he sat me down, and he warned me.
He was like, "Be careful going down this path.
I'm not sure this project's going to pan out."
Because he was afraid I was walking into a trap.
I was taking on a socially embarrassing question with an answer that he thought might not be particularly interesting.
And that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements.
It had the central fluid, it had the surrounding wall, and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices around the long axis of the skeleton.
So the image behind me shows a piece of tissue in one of these cross helical skeletons cut so that you're looking at the surface of the wall.
The arrow shows you the long axis.
And you can see two layers of fibers, one in blue and one in yellow, arranged in left-handed and right-handed angles.
And if you weren't just looking at a little section of the fibers, those fibers would be going in helices around the long axis of the skeleton -- something like a Chinese finger trap, where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck.
And these skeletons have a particular set of behaviors, which I'm going to demonstrate in a film.
It's a model skeleton that I made out of a piece of cloth that I wrapped around an inflated balloon.
The cloth's cut on the bias.
So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices, and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves, which means the skeleton's flexible.
It lengthens, shortens and bends really easily in response to internal or external forces.
Now my adviser's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton.
What are you going to contribute?
What new thing are you contributing to our knowledge of biology?
And I thought, "Yeah, he does have a really good point here."
So I spent a long, long time thinking about it.
And one thing kept bothering me, and that's, when they're functioning, penises don't wiggle.
So something interesting had to be going on.
So I went ahead, collected wall tissue, prepared it so it was erect, sectioned it, put it on slides and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look, fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety.
But instead I saw this.
There's an outer layer and an inner layer.
The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton.
I was really surprised at this.
Everyone I showed it was really surprised at this.
Why was everyone surprised at this?
That's because we knew theoretically that there was another way of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton, and that was with fibers at zero degrees and 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure.
The thing is, no one had ever seen it before in nature.
And now I was looking at one.
Those fibers in that particular orientation give the skeleton a very, very different behavior.
I'm going to show a model made out of exactly the same materials.
So it'll be made of the same cotton cloth, same balloon, same internal pressure.
But the only difference is that the fibers are arranged differently.
And you'll see that, unlike the cross helical model, this model resists extension and contraction and resists bending.
Now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues.
They're an integral part of the penile skeleton.
If the wall around the erectile tissue wasn't there, if it wasn't reinforced in this way, the shape would change, but the inflated penis would not resist bending, and erection simply wouldn't work.
It's an observation with obvious medical applications in humans as well, but it's also relevant in a broad sense, I think, to the design of prosthetics, soft robots, basically anything where changes of shape and stiffness are important.
So to sum up: Twenty years ago, I had a college adviser tell me, when I went to the college and said, "I'm kind of interested in anatomy," they said, "Anatomy's a dead science."
He couldn't have been more wrong.
I really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies.
Not just about its genetics and molecular biology, but up here in the meat end of the scale.
We've got limits on our time.
We often focus on one disease, one model, one problem, but my experience suggests that we should take the time to apply ideas broadly between systems and just see where it takes us.
After all, if ideas about invertebrate skeletons can give us insights about mammalian reproductive systems, there could be lots of other wild and productive connections lurking out there just waiting to be found.
Thank you.

When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe, it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population is HIV positive.
It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.
For instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother.
When I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap.
He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS, and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS.
He liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.
When she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lap and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated.
Before I left, I actually asked him if I could get him something.
I thought he would ask for a toy, or candy, and he asked me for slippers, because he said that his feet were cold.
This is Joyce who's -- in this picture -- 21.
Single mother, HIV positive.
I photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa.
And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan and got a call from a woman who I didn't know, but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away at the age of 23.
Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter, like so many other Zimbabwean children who've been orphaned by the epidemic.
So a few of the stories.
With every picture, there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told.
All these pictures are from Zimbabwe.
Kirsten, will you just take one minute, just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa?
Kirsten Ashburn: Mmm, gosh.
Just -- Actually, I was working at the time, doing production for a fashion photographer.
And I was constantly reading the New York Times, and stunned by the statistics, the numbers.
It was just frightening.
So I quit my job and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle.
And I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month -- this is in December 2000 -- then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half, and then went back again this March 2002 for another month and a half in Zimbabwe.
That's an amazing story, thank you.
KB: Thanks for letting me show these.

<title>Kristen Ashburn: The face of AIDS in Africa</title>
<description>In this moving talk, documentary photographer Kristen Ashburn shares unforgettable images of the human impact of AIDS in Africa.</description>
<keywords>AIDS,Africa,activism,disease,global issues,health,media,photography,science</keywords>

My talk today is about something maybe a couple of you have already heard about.
It's called the Arab Spring.
Anyone heard of it?
So in 2011, power shifted, from the few to the many, from oval offices to central squares, from carefully guarded airwaves to open-source networks.
But before Tahrir was a global symbol of liberation, there were representative surveys already giving people a voice in quieter but still powerful ways.
I study Muslim societies around the world at Gallup.
Since 2001, we've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people -- young and old, men and women, educated and illiterate.
My talk today draws on this research to reveal why Arabs rose up and what they want now.
Now this region's very diverse, and every country is unique.
But those who revolted shared a common set of grievances and have similar demands today.
I'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt.
It has nothing to do with the fact that I was born there, of course.
But it's the largest Arab country and it's also one with a great deal of influence.
But I'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region to look at the mundane topics of Arab views of religion and politics and how this impacts women, revealing some surprises along the way.
So after analyzing mounds of data, what we discovered was this: Unemployment and poverty alone did not lead to the Arab revolts of 2011.
If an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor sparked these revolutions, it was the difference between what Arabs experienced and what they expected that provided the fuel.
To tell you what I mean, consider this trend in Egypt.
On paper the country was doing great.
In fact, it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth.
But under the surface was a very different reality.
In 2010, right before the revolution, even though GDP per capita had been growing at five percent for several years, Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives.
Now this is very unusual, because globally we find that, not surprisingly, people feel better as their country gets richer.
And that's because they have better job opportunities and their state offers better social services.
But it was exactly the opposite in Egypt.
As the country got more well-off, unemployment actually rose and people's satisfaction with things like housing and education plummeted.
But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice.
It was also people's deep longing for freedom.
Contrary to the clash of civilizations theory, Arabs didn't despise Western liberty, they desired it.
As early as 2001, we asked Arabs, and Muslims in general around the world, what they admired most about the West.
Among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice.
In their own words to an open-ended question we heard, "Their political system is transparent and it's following democracy in its true sense."
Another said it was "liberty and freedom and being open-minded with each other."
Majorities as high as 90 percent and greater in Egypt, Indonesia and Iran told us in 2005 that if they were to write a new constitution for a theoretical new country that they would guarantee freedom of speech as a fundamental right, especially in Egypt.
Eighty-eight percent said moving toward greater democracy would help Muslims progress -- the highest percentage of any country we surveyed.
But pressed up against these democratic aspirations was a very different day-to-day experience, especially in Egypt.
While aspiring to democracy the most, they were the least likely population in the world to say that they had actually voiced their opinion to a public official in the last month -- at only four percent.
So while economic development made a few people rich, it left many more worse off.
As people felt less and less free, they also felt less and less provided for.
So rather than viewing their former regimes as generous if overprotective fathers, they viewed them as essentially prison wardens.
So now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak's 30-year rule, they potentially could be an example for the region.
If Egypt is to succeed at building a society based on the rule of law, it could be a model.
If, however, the core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed, the consequences could be catastrophic -- not just for Egypt, but for the entire region.
The signs don't look good, some have said.
Islamists, not the young liberals that sparked the revolution, won the majority in Parliament.
The military council has cracked down on civil society and protests and the country's economy continues to suffer.
Evaluating Egypt on this basis alone, however, ignores the real revolution.
Because Egyptians are more optimistic than they have been in years, far less divided on religious-secular lines than we would think and poised for the demands of democracy.
Whether they support Islamists or liberals, Egyptians' priorities for this government are identical, and they are jobs, stability and education, not moral policing.
But most of all, for the first time in decades, they expect to be active participants, not spectators, in the affairs of their country.
I was meeting with a group of newly-elected parliamentarians from Egypt and Tunisia a couple of weeks ago.
And what really struck me about them was that they weren't only optimistic, but they kind of struck me as nervous, One said to me, "Our people used to gather in cafes to watch football" -- or soccer, as we say in America -- "and now they gather to watch Parliament."
"They're really watching us, and we can't help but worry that we're not going to live up to their expectations."
And what really struck me is that less than 24 months ago, it was the people that were nervous about being watched by their government.
And the reason that they're expecting a lot is because they have a new-found hope for the future.
So right before the revolution we said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives, but not only that, they thought their future would be no better.
What really changed after the ouster of Mubarak wasn't that life got easier.
It actually got harder.
But people's expectations for their future went up significantly.
And this hope, this optimism, endured a year of turbulent transition.
One reason that there's this optimism is because, contrary to what many people have said, most Egyptians think things really have changed in many ways.
So while Egyptians were known for their single-digit turnout in elections before the revolution, the last election had around 70 percent voter turnout -- men and women.
Where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in 2010 -- I'm surprised it was a quarter -- 90 percent thought that this last election was honest.
Now why this matters is because we discovered a link between people's faith in their democratic process and their faith that oppressed people can change their situation through peaceful means alone.
Now I know what some of you are thinking.
The Egyptian people, and many other Arabs who've revolted and are in transition, have very high expectations of the government.
They're just victims of a long-time autocracy, expecting a paternal state to solve all their problems.
But this conclusion would ignore a tectonic shift taking place in Egypt far from the cameras in Tahrir Square.
And that is Egyptians' elevated expectations are placed first on themselves.
In the country once known for its passive resignation, where, as bad as things got, only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official, today 90 percent tell us that if there's a problem in their community, it's up to them to fix it.
And three-fourths believe they not only have the responsibility, but the power to make change.
And this empowerment also applies to women, whose role in the revolts cannot be underestimated.
They were doctors and dissidents, artists and organizers.
A full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas to ask or to demand liberty and justice in Egypt were women.
Now people have raised some real concerns about what the rise of Islamist parties means for women.
What we've found about the role of religion in law and the role of religion in society is that there's no female consensus.
We found that women in one country look more like the men in that country than their female counterparts across the border.
Now what this suggests is that how women view religion's role in society is shaped more by their own country's culture and context than one monolithic view that religion is simply bad for women.
Where women agree, however, is on their own role, and that it must be central and active.
And here is where we see the greatest gender difference within a country -- on the issue of women's rights.
Now how men feel about women's rights matters to the future of this region.
Because we discovered a link between men's support for women's employment and how many women are actually employed in professional fields in that country.
So the question becomes, What drives men's support for women's rights?
What about men's views of religion and law?
[Does] a man's opinion of the role of religion in politics shape their view of women's rights?
The answer is no.
We found absolutely no correlation, no impact whatsoever, between these two variables.
What drives men's support for women's employment is men's employment, their level of education as well as a high score on their country's U.N. Human Development Index.
What this means is that human development, not secularization, is what's key to women's empowerment in the transforming Middle East.
And the transformation continues.
From Wall Street to Mohammed Mahmoud Street, it has never been more important to understand the aspirations of ordinary people.
Thank you.

You should be nice to nerds.
In fact, I'd go so far as to say, if you don't already have a nerd in your life, you should get one.
I'm just saying.
Scientists and engineers change the world.
I'd like to tell you about a magical place called DARPA where scientists and engineers defy the impossible and refuse to fear failure.
Now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize, because when you remove the fear of failure, impossible things suddenly become possible.
If you want to know how, ask yourself this question: What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?
If you really ask yourself this question, you can't help but feel uncomfortable.
I feel a little uncomfortable.
Because when you ask it, you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you, how it keeps us from attempting great things, and life gets dull, amazing things stop happening.
Sure, good things happen, but amazing things stop happening.
Now I should be clear, I'm not encouraging failure, I'm discouraging fear of failure.
Because it's not failure itself that constrains us.
The path to truly new, never-been-done-before things always has failure along the way.
We're tested.
And in part, that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great.
Clemenceau said, "Life gets interesting when we fail, because it's a sign that we've surpassed ourselves."
In 1895, Lord Kelvin declared that heavier-than-air flying machines were impossible.
In October of 1903, the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly.
And two months later on December 17th, Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina.
The flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet.
That was 1903.
One year later, the next declarations of impossibilities began.
Ferdinand Foch, a French army general credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the French army, said, "Airplanes are interesting toys, but of no military value."
40 years later, aero experts coined the term transonic.
They debated, should it have one S or two?
You see, they were having trouble in this flight regime, and it wasn't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound.
In 1947, there was no wind tunnel data beyond Mach 0.85.
And yet, on Tuesday, October 14th, 1947, Chuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X-1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility, and in so doing, he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound.
Six of eight Atlas rockets blew up on the pad.
After 11 complete mission failures, we got our first images from space.
And on that first flight we got more data than in all U-2 missions combined.
It took a lot of failures to get there.
Since we took to the sky, we have wanted to fly faster and farther.
And to do so, we've had to believe in impossible things.
And we've had to refuse to fear failure.
That's still true today.
Today, we don't talk about flying transonically, or even supersonically, we talk about flying hypersonically -- not Mach 2 or Mach 3, Mach 20.
At Mach 20, we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds.
At that speed, the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel -- 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit -- like a blast furnace.
We are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it.
And we are flying it, or trying to.
DARPA's hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built.
It's boosted to near-space atop a Minotaur IV rocket.
Now the Minotaur IV has too much impulse, so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an 89 degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory.
That's an unnatural act for a rocket.
The third stage has a camera.
We call it rocketcam.
And it's pointed at the hypersonic glider.
This is the actual rocketcam footage from flight one.
Now to conceal the shape, we changed the aspect ratio a little bit.
But this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards Earth.
We've flown twice.
In the first flight, no aerodynamic control of the vehicle.
But we collected more hypersonic flight data than in 30 years of ground-based testing combined.
And in the second flight, three minutes of fully-controlled, aerodynamic flight at Mach 20.
We must fly again, because amazing, never-been-done-before things require that you fly.
You can't learn to fly at Mach 20 unless you fly.
And while there's no substitute for speed, maneuverability is a very close second.
If a Mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from New York to Long Beach, a hummingbird would take, well, days.
You see, hummingbirds are not hypersonic, but they are maneuverable.
In fact, the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards.
It can fly up, down, forwards, backwards, even upside-down.
And so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans can't go, we'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so.
This is a hummingbird drone.
It can fly in all directions, even backwards.
It can hover and rotate.
This prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera.
It weighs less than one AA battery.
It does not eat nectar.
In 2008, it flew for a whopping 20 seconds, a year later, two minutes, then six, eventually 11.
Many prototypes crashed -- many.
But there's no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly.
It's beautiful, isn't it.
Wow.
It's great.
Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot.
Failure is part of creating new and amazing things.
We cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things -- like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain, or maybe even ice; a robot that can run like a cheetah, or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human.
Or perhaps, Spider Man will one day be Gecko Man.
A gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe.
One square millimeter of a gecko's footpad has 14,000 hair-like structures called setae.
They are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces.
Today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot.
The result, a four-by-four-inch can support a static load of 660 pounds.
That's enough to stick six 42-inch plasma TV's to your wall, no nails.
So much for Velcro, right?
And it's not just passive structures, it's entire machines.
This is a spider mite.
It's one millimeter long, but it looks like Godzilla next to these micromachines.
In the world of Godzilla spider mites, we can make millions of mirrors, each one-fifth the diameter of a human hair, moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays, so that we can watch movies like "Godzilla" in high-def.
And if we can build machines at that scale, what about Eiffel Tower-like trusses at the microscale?
Today we are making metals that are lighter than Styrofoam, so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air -- so light that you can make a car that two people can lift, but so strong that it has the crash-worthiness of an SUV.
From the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature's storms.
There are 44 lightning strikes per second around the globe.
Each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 degrees Fahrenheit -- hotter than the surface of the Sun.
What if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons, beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters?
Experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS.
Electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains.
Using a grid the size of your thumb, with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain, Tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm.
And his thoughts made him reach for Katie.
This is the first time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone.
And it is the first time that Tim has held Katie's hand in seven years.
That moment mattered to Tim and Katie, and this green goo may someday matter to you.
This green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life.
It was made in tobacco plants.
Tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months, and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever.
And if it seems far-fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy, what about gamers that could solve problems that experts can't solve?
Last September, the gamers of Foldit solved the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys.
Now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments.
For 15 years, it was unsolved in the scientific community.
The gamers of Foldit solved it in 15 days.
Now they were able to do so by working together.
They were able to work together because they're connected by the Internet.
And others, also connected to the Internet, used it as an instrument of democracy.
And together they changed the fate of their nation.
The Internet is home to two billion people, or 30 percent of the world's population.
It allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals.
It allows us to amplify our voices and our power as a group.
But it too had humble beginnings.
In 1969, the internet was but a dream, a few sketches on a piece of paper.
And then on October 29th, the first packet-switched message was sent from UCLA to SRI.
The first two letters of the word "Login," that's all that made it through -- an L and an O -- and then a buffer overflow crashed the system.
Two letters, an L and an O, now a worldwide force.
So who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA?
They are nerds, and they are heroes among us.
They challenge existing perspectives at the edges of science and under the most demanding of conditions.
They remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible and we refuse to fear failure.
They remind us that we all have nerd power.
Sometimes we just forget.
You see, there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure, when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing, you were good at math, you could build things, you were an astronaut, an adventurer, Jacques Cousteau, you could jump higher, run faster, kick harder than anyone.
You believed in impossible things and you were fearless.
You were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero.
Scientists and engineers can indeed change the world.
So can you.
You were born to.
So go ahead, ask yourself, what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?
Now I want to say, this is not easy.
It's hard to hold onto this feeling, really hard.
I guess in some way, I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard.
Doubt and fear always creep in.
We think someone else, someone smarter than us, someone more capable, someone with more resources will solve that problem.
But there isn't anyone else; there's just you.
And if we're lucky, in that moment, someone steps into that doubt and fear, takes a hand and says, "Let me help you believe."
Jason Harley did that for me.
Jason started at DARPA on March 18th, 2010.
He was with our transportation team.
I saw Jason nearly every day, sometimes twice a day.
And more so than most, he saw the highs and the lows, the celebrations and the disappointments.
And on one particularly dark day for me, Jason sat down and he wrote an email.
He was encouraging, but firm.
And when he hit send, he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make.
It mattered to me.
In that moment and still today when I doubt, when I feel afraid, when I need to reconnect with that feeling, I remember his words, they were so powerful.
Text: "There is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you."
Superhero, superhero. Superhero, superhero. Superhero, superhero. Superhero, superhero. Superhero, superhero. Voice: Because that's what being a superhero is all about.
RD: "There is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you."
And remember, be nice to nerds.
Thank you. Thank you.
Regina, thank you.
I have a couple of questions.
So that glider of yours, the Mach 20 glider, the first one, no control, it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere.
RD: Yeah, yeah. It did.
Yeah, it also went into the Pacific.
We didn't fly it into the Pacific.
No, there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed.
And so in the second flight, we were able to get three minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it.
I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service from New York to Long Beach anytime soon.
RD: It might be a little warm.
What do you picture that glider being used for?
RD: Well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this.
How it's ultimately used will be determined by the military.
Now the purpose of the vehicle though, the purpose of the technology, is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes.
And to carry a payload of more than a few pounds?
Like what's the payload it could carry?
RD: Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be, right.
We've got to fly it first.
But not necessarily just a camera?
RD: No, not necessarily just a camera.
It's amazing.
The hummingbird?
RD: Yeah?
I'm curious, you started your beautiful sequence on flight with a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly, and there haven't been that many planes built since that flap wings.
Why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry and copy a hummingbird?
Isn't that a very expensive solution for a small maneuverable flying object?
RD: So I mean, in part, we wondered if it was possible to do it.
And you have to revisit these questions over time.
The folks at AeroVironment tried 300 or more different wing designs, 12 different forms of the avionics.
It took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly.
But there's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you'd recognize.
So we often talk about stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing, but when things looks just natural, you also don't see them.
Ah. So it's not necessarily just the performance.
It's partly the look.
It's actually, "Look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters."
Because I think, as well as the awe of looking at that, I'm sure some people here are thinking, technology catches up so quick, how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies one through a window of the White House?
I mean, do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here?
RD: Well look, our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise.
That's what we do.
It would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time.
It's just the nature of what we do.
Now our responsibility is to push that edge.
And we have to be, of course, mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used, but we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn't advancing; it's advancing.
I mean, you're clearly a really inspiring leader.
And you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention, but at a personal level, in a way I can't imagine doing your job.
Do you wake up in the night sometimes, just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of your team's brilliance?
RD: Sure.
I think you couldn't be human if you didn't ask those questions.
How do you answer them?
RD: Well I don't always have answers for them, right.
I think that we learn as time goes on.
My job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have.
I work with some of the most amazing people.
And with that exhilaration, comes a really deep sense of responsibility.
And so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible and this tremendous seriousness of what it means.
Regina, that was jaw-dropping, as they say.
Thank you so much for coming to TED.

Embracing otherness.
When I first heard this theme, I thought, well, embracing otherness is embracing myself.
And the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me, and it's given me an insight into the whole notion of self, which I think is worth sharing with you today.
We each have a self, but I don't think that we're born with one.
You know how newborn babies believe they're part of everything; they're not separate?
Well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly.
It's like that initial stage is over -- oneness: infancy, unformed, primitive.
It's no longer valid or real.
What is real is separateness, and at some point in early babyhood, the idea of self starts to form.
Our little portion of oneness is given a name, is told all kinds of things about itself, and these details, opinions and ideas become facts, which go towards building ourselves, our identity.
And that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world.
But the self is a projection based on other people's projections.
Is it who we really are?
Or who we really want to be, or should be?
So this whole interaction with self and identity was a very difficult one for me growing up.
The self that I attempted to take out into the world was rejected over and over again.
And my panic at not having a self that fit, and the confusion that came from my self being rejected, created anxiety, shame and hopelessness, which kind of defined me for a long time.
But in retrospect, the destruction of my self was so repetitive that I started to see a pattern.
The self changed, got affected, broken, destroyed, but another one would evolve -- sometimes stronger, sometimes hateful, sometimes not wanting to be there at all.
The self was not constant.
And how many times would my self have to die before I realized that it was never alive in the first place?
I grew up on the coast of England in the '70s.
My dad is white from Cornwall, and my mom is black from Zimbabwe.
Even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people.
But nature had its wicked way, and brown babies were born.
But from about the age of five, I was aware that I didn't fit.
I was the black atheist kid in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns.
I was an anomaly, and my self was rooting around for definition and trying to plug in.
Because the self likes to fit, to see itself replicated, to belong.
That confirms its existence and its importance.
And it is important.
It has an extremely important function.
Without it, we literally can't interface with others.
We can't hatch plans and climb that stairway of popularity, of success.
But my skin color wasn't right.
My hair wasn't right.
My history wasn't right.
My self became defined by otherness, which meant that, in that social world, I didn't really exist.
And I was "other" before being anything else -- even before being a girl.
I was a noticeable nobody.
Another world was opening up around this time: performance and dancing.
That nagging dread of self-hood didn't exist when I was dancing.
I'd literally lose myself.
And I was a really good dancer.
I would put all my emotional expression into my dancing.
I could be in the movement in a way that I wasn't able to be in my real life, in myself.
And at 16, I stumbled across another opportunity, and I earned my first acting role in a film.
I can hardly find the words to describe the peace I felt when I was acting.
My dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self, not my own, and it felt so good.
It was the first time that I existed inside a fully-functioning self -- one that I controlled, that I steered, that I gave life to.
But the shooting day would end, and I'd return to my gnarly, awkward self.
By 19, I was a fully-fledged movie actor, but still searching for definition.
I applied to read anthropology at university.
Dr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview, and she asked me, "How would you define race?"
Well, I thought I had the answer to that one, and I said, "Skin color."
"So biology, genetics?" she said.
"Because, Thandie, that's not accurate.
Because there's actually more genetic difference between a black Kenyan and a black Ugandan than there is between a black Kenyan and, say, a white Norwegian.
Because we all stem from Africa.
So in Africa, there's been more time to create genetic diversity."
In other words, race has no basis in biological or scientific fact.
On the one hand, result.
Right?
On the other hand, my definition of self just lost a huge chunk of its credibility.
But what was credible, what is biological and scientific fact, is that we all stem from Africa -- in fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve who lived 160,000 years ago.
And race is an illegitimate concept which our selves have created based on fear and ignorance.
Strangely, these revelations didn't cure my low self-esteem, that feeling of otherness.
My desire to disappear was still very powerful.
I had a degree from Cambridge; I had a thriving career, but my self was a car crash, and I wound up with bulimia and on a therapist's couch.
And of course I did.
I still believed my self was all I was.
I still valued self-worth above all other worth, and what was there to suggest otherwise?
We've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self.
Look at the industry for self-image and the jobs it creates, the revenue it turns over.
We'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing.
But it's not. It's a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death.
But there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection -- and that thing is oneness, our essence.
The self's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it's connected to its creator -- to you and to me.
And that can happen with awareness -- awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self-hood.
For a start, we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves.
It happens when I dance, when I'm acting.
I'm earthed in my essence, and my self is suspended.
In those moments, I'm connected to everything -- the ground, the air, the sounds, the energy from the audience.
All my senses are alert and alive in much the same way as an infant might feel -- that feeling of oneness.
And when I'm acting a role, I inhabit another self, and I give it life for awhile, because when the self is suspended so is divisiveness and judgment.
And I've played everything from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to Secretary of State in 2004.
And no matter how other these selves might be, they're all related in me.
And I honestly believe the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure.
I always wondered why I could feel others' pain so deeply, why I could recognize the somebody in the nobody.
It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.
I thought I lacked substance, and the fact that I could feel others' meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.
The thing that was a source of shame was actually a source of enlightenment.
And when I realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function, a funny thing happened.
I stopped giving it so much authority.
I give it its due.
I take it to therapy.
I've become very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior.
But I'm not ashamed of my self.
In fact, I respect my self and its function.
And over time and with practice, I've tried to live more and more from my essence.
And if you can do that, incredible things happen.
I was in Congo in February, dancing and celebrating with women who've survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways -- destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves' addiction to iPods, Pads, and bling, which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain, their suffering, their death.
Because, hey, if we're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life, then we're devaluing and desensitizing life.
And in that disconnected state, yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows, destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war.
So here's a note to self: The cracks have started to show in our constructed world, and oceans will continue to surge through the cracks, and oil and blood, rivers of it.
Crucially, we haven't been figuring out how to live in oneness with the Earth and every other living thing.
We've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other -- billions of each other.
Only we're not living with each other; our crazy selves are living with each other and perpetuating an epidemic of disconnection.
Let's live with each other and take it a breath at a time.
If we can get under that heavy self, light a torch of awareness, and find our essence, our connection to the infinite and every other living thing.
We knew it from the day we were born.
Let's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness.
It's more a reality than the ones our selves have created.
Imagine what kind of existence we can have if we honor inevitable death of self, appreciate the privilege of life and marvel at what comes next.
Simple awareness is where it begins.
Thank you for listening.

<title>Thandie Newton: Embracing otherness, embracing myself</title>
<description>Actor Thandie Newton tells the story of finding her "otherness" -- first, as a child growing up in two distinct cultures, and then as an actor playing with many different selves. A warm, wise talk, fresh from stage at TEDGlobal 2011.</description>
<keywords>art,arts,culture,entertainment,psychology,self</keywords>

For as long as I can remember, I have felt a very deep connection to animals and to the ocean.
And at this age, my personal idol was Flipper the dolphin.
And when I first learned about endangered species, I was truly distressed to know that every day animals were being wiped off the face of this Earth forever.
And I wanted to do something to help, but I always wondered, what could one person possibly do to make a difference?
And it would be 30 years, but I would eventually get the answer to that question.
When these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico last year during the horrific BP oil spill, a German biologist by the name of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying, "We should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released."
And I could not disagree more.
And in addition, I believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life.
And I want to tell you why I feel so strongly about this.
On June 23rd, 2000, a ship named the Treasure sank off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa, spilling 1,300 tons of fuel, which polluted the habitats of nearly half the entire world population of African penguins.
Now the ship sank between Robben Island to the south and Dassen Island to the north.
And these are two of the penguins' main breeding islands.
And exactly six years and three days earlier, on June 20th, 1994, a ship named the Apollo Sea sank near Dassen Island, oiling 10,000 penguins -- half of which died.
Now when the Treasure sank in 2000, it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the African penguin -- which at the time, was listed as a threatened species.
And soon, nearly 20,000 penguins were covered with this toxic oil.
And the local seabird rescue center, named SANCCOB, immediately launched a massive rescue operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken.
Now at the time, I was working down the street.
I was a penguin aquarist at the New England Aquarium.
And exactly 11 years ago yesterday, the phone rang in the penguin office.
And with that call, my life would change forever.
It was Estelle van der Meer calling from SANCCOB, saying, "Please come help.
We have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing, but completely inexperienced, volunteers.
And we need penguin experts to come train and supervise them."
So two days later, I was on a plane headed for Cape Town with a team of penguin specialists.
And the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal.
In fact, many people compared it to a war zone.
And last week, a 10 year-old girl asked me, "What did it feel like when you first walked into that building and saw so many oiled penguins?"
And this is what happened.
I was instantly transported back to that moment in time.
Penguins are very vocal birds and really, really noisy.
And so I expected to walk into this building and be met with this cacophony of honking and braying and squawking, but instead, when we stepped through those doors and into the building, it was eerily silent.
So it was very clear these were stressed, sick, traumatized birds.
The other thing that was so striking was the sheer number of volunteers.
Up to 1,000 people a day came to the rescue center, and eventually, over the course of this rescue, more than 12 and a half thousand volunteers came from all over the world to Cape Town to help save these birds.
And the amazing thing was that not one of them had to be there -- yet they were.
So for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity, this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring.
So the day after we arrived, two of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two, and room two had more than 4,000 oiled penguins in it.
Now mind you, three days earlier, we had 60 penguins under our care, so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified -- at least I was.
Personally, I really didn't know if I was capable of handling such a monstrous task.
And collectively, we really didn't know if we could pull this off.
Because we all knew that just six years earlier, half as many penguins had been oiled and rescued and only half of them had survived.
So would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins?
We just did not know.
But what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers -- three of whom here are force-feeding penguins.
And you may notice they're wearing very thick gloves.
And what you should know about African penguins is that they have razor-sharp beaks.
And before long, our bodies were covered head to toe with these nasty wounds inflicted by the terrified penguins.
Now the day after we arrived, a new crisis began to unfold.
The oil slick was now moving north towards Dassen Island, and the rescuers despaired, because they knew if the oil hit, it would not be possible to rescue any more oiled birds.
And there really were no good solutions.
But then finally, one of the researchers threw out this crazy idea.
He said, "Okay, why don't we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled" -- they collected 20,000 -- "and we'll ship them 500 miles up the coast to Port Elizabeth in these open air trucks and release them into the clean waters there and let them swim back home."
So three of those penguins -- Peter, Pamela and Percy -- wore satellite tags, and the researchers crossed their fingers and hoped that by the time they got back home, the oil would be cleaned up from their islands.
And luckily, the day they arrived, it was.
So it had been a huge gamble, but it had paid off.
And so they know now that they can use this strategy in future oil spills.
So in wildlife rescue, as in life, we learn from each previous experience, and we learn from both our successes and our failures.
And the main thing learned during the Apollo Sea rescue in '94 was that most of those penguins had died due to the unwitting use of poorly ventilated transport boxes and trucks -- because they just had not been prepared to deal with so many oiled penguins at once.
So in these six years between these two oil spills, they built thousands of these well-ventilated boxes, and as a result, during the Treasure rescue, just 160 penguins died during the transport process, as opposed to 5,000.
So this alone was a huge victory.
Something else learned during the Apollo rescue was how to train the penguins to take fish freely from their hands, using these training boxes.
And we used this technique again during the Treasure rescue.
But an interesting thing was noted during the training process.
The first penguins to make that transition to free feeding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the Apollo Sea spill six years earlier.
So penguins learn from previous experience, too.
So all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned from their bodies.
And it would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin.
And when you clean a penguin, you first have to spray it with a degreaser.
And this brings me to my favorite story from the Treasure rescue.
About a year prior to this oil spill, a 17 year-old student had invented a degreaser.
And they'd been using it at SANCCOB with great success, so they began using it during the Treasure rescue.
But part way through, they ran out.
So in a panic, Estelle from SANCCOB called the student and said, "Please, you have to make more."
So he raced to the lab and made enough to clean the rest of the birds.
So I just think it is the coolest thing that a teenager invented a product that helped save the lives of thousands of animals.
So what happened to those 20,000 oiled penguins?
And was Silvia Gaus right?
Should we routinely euthanize all oiled birds because most of them are going to die anyway?
Well she could not be more wrong.
After half a million hours of grueling volunteer labor, more than 90 percent of those oiled penguins were successfully returned to the wild.
And we know from follow-up studies that they have lived just as long as never-oiled penguins, and bred nearly as successfully.
And in addition, about 3,000 penguin chicks were rescued and hand-raised.
And again, we know from long-term monitoring that more of these hand-raised chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age than do parent-raised chicks.
So, armed with this knowledge, SANCCOB has a chick-bolstering project.
And every year they rescue and raise abandoned chicks, and they have a very impressive 80 percent success rate.
And this is critically important because, one year ago, the African penguin was declared endangered.
And they could be extinct in less than 10 years, if we don't do something now to protect them.
So what did I learn from this intense and unforgettable experience?
Personally, I learned that I am capable of handling so much more than I ever dreamed possible.
And I learned that one person can make a huge difference.
Just look at that 17 year-old.
And when we come together and work as one, we can achieve extraordinary things.
And truly, to be a part of something so much larger than yourself is the most rewarding experience you can possibly have.
So I'd like to leave you with one final thought and a challenge, if you will.
My mission as the penguin lady is to raise awareness and funding to protect penguins, but why should any of you care about penguins?
Well, you should care because they're an indicator species.
And simply put, if penguins are dying, it means our oceans are dying, and we ultimately will be affected, because, as Sylvia Earle says, "The oceans are our life-support system."
And the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming.
And these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about.
So if we each do our part, together, we can make a difference, and we can help keep penguins from going extinct.
Humans have always been the greatest threat to penguins, but we are now their only hope.
Thank you.

The will to live life differently can start in some of the most unusual places.
This is where I come from, Todmorden.
It's a market town in the north of England, 15,000 people, between Leeds and Manchester, fairly normal market town.
It used to look like this, and now it's more like this, with fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place.
We call it propaganda gardening.
Corner row railway, station car park, front of a health center, people's front gardens, and even in front of the police station.
We've got edible canal towpaths, and we've got sprouting cemeteries.
The soil is extremely good.
We've even invented a new form of tourism.
It's called vegetable tourism, and believe it or not, people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds, even when there's not much growing.
But it starts a conversation.
And, you know, we're not doing it because we're bored.
We're doing it because we want to start a revolution.
We tried to answer this simple question: Can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living, see spaces around them differently, think about the resources they use differently, interact differently?
Can we find that language?
And then, can we replicate those actions?
And the answer would appear to be yes, and the language would appear to be food.
So, three and a half years ago, a few of us sat around a kitchen table and we just invented the whole thing.
We came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting.
We did not consult. We did not write a report.
Enough of all that.
And we said to that public meeting in Todmorden, look, let's imagine that our town is focused around three plates: a community plate, the way we live our everyday lives; a learning plate, what we teach our kids in school and what new skills we share amongst ourselves; and business, what we do with the pound in our pocket and which businesses we choose to support.
Now, let's imagine those plates agitated with community actions around food.
If we start one of those community plates spinning, that's really great, that really starts to empower people, but if we can then spin that community plate with the learning plate, and then spin it with the business plate, we've got a real show there, we've got some action theater.
We're starting to build resilience ourselves.
We're starting to reinvent community ourselves, and we've done it all without a flipping strategy document.
We've not asked anybody's permission to do this, we're just doing it.
And we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start, and most importantly of all, we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say, "These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems," because I have seen the power of small actions, and it is awesome.
So, back to the public meeting.
We put that proposition to the meeting, two seconds, and then the room exploded.
I have never, ever experienced anything like that in my life.
And it's been the same in every single room, in every town that we've ever told our story.
People are ready and respond to the story of food.
They want positive actions they can engage in, and in their bones, they know it's time to take personal responsibility and invest in more kindness to each other and to the environment.
And since we had that meeting three and a half years ago, it's been a heck of a roller coaster.
We started with a seed swap, really simple stuff, and then we took an area of land, a strip on the side of our main road, which was a dog toilet, basically, and we turned it into a really lovely herb garden.
We took the corner of the car park in the station that you saw, and we made vegetable beds for everybody to share and pick from themselves.
We went to the doctors. We've just had a 6-million-pound health center built in Todmorden, and for some reason that I cannot comprehend, it has been surrounded by prickly plants.
So we went to the doctors, said, "Would you mind us taking them up?"
They said, "Absolutely fine, provided you get planning permission and you do it in Latin and you do it in triplicate," so we did — — and now there are fruit trees and bushes and herbs and vegetables around that doctor's surgery.
And there's been lots of other examples, like the corn that was in front of the police station, and the old people's home that we've planted it with food that they can pick and grow.
But it isn't just about growing, because we all are part of this jigsaw.
It's about taking those artistic people in your community and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds to explain to people what's growing there, because there's so many people that don't really recognize a vegetable unless it's in a bit of plastic with a bit of an instruction packet on the top.
So we have some people who designed these things, "If it looks like this, please don't pick it, but if it looks like this, help yourself."
This is about sharing and investing in kindness.
And for those people that don't want to do either of those things, maybe they can cook, so we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street, or in the pub, or in the church, or wherever people are living their lives.
This is about us going to the people and saying, "We are all part of the local food jigsaw, we are all part of a solution."
And then, because we know we've got vegetable tourists and we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic, we thought, what could we do to give them an even better experience?
So we invented, without asking, of course, the Incredible Edible Green Route.
And this is a route of exhibition gardens, and edible towpaths, and bee-friendly sites, and the story of pollinators, and it's a route that we designed that takes people through the whole of our town, past our cafes and our small shops, through our market, not just to and fro from the supermarket, and we're hoping that, in changing people's footfall around our town, we're also changing their behavior.
And then there's the second plate, the learning plate.
Well, we're in partnership with a high school.
We've created a company. We are designing and building an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare at the back of the high school, like you do, and now we're going to be growing fish and vegetables in an orchard with bees, and the kids are helping us build that, and the kids are on the board, and because the community was really keen on working with the high school, the high school is now teaching agriculture, and because it's teaching agriculture, we started to think, how could we then get those kids that never had a qualification before in their lives but are really excited about growing, how can we give them some more experience?
So we got some land that was donated by a local garden center.
It was really quite muddy, but in a truly incredible way, totally voluntary-led, we have turned that into a market garden training center, and that is polytunnels and raised beds and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers and think maybe there's a job in this for me in the future.
And because we were doing that, some local academics said, "You know, we could help design a commercial horticulture course for you.
There's not one that we know of."
So they're doing that, and we're going to launch it later this year, and it's all an experiment, and it's all voluntary.
And then there's the third plate, because if you walk through an edible landscape, and if you're learning new skills, and if you start to get interested in what's growing seasonally, you might just want to spend more of your own money in support of local producers, not just veg, but meat and cheese and beer and whatever else it might be.
But then, we're just a community group, you know.
We're just all volunteers. What could we actually do?
So we did some really simple things.
We fundraised, we got some blackboards, we put "Incredible Edible" on the top, we gave it every market trader that was selling locally, and they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week.
Really popular. People congregated around it.
Sales were up.
And then, we had a chat with the farmers, and we said, "We're really serious about this," but they didn't actually believe us, so we thought, okay, what should we do? I know. If we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product, maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious.
So we launched a campaign -- because it just amuses me -- called Every Egg Matters.
And what we did was we put people on our egg map.
It's a stylized map of Togmorden.
Anybody that's selling their excess eggs at the garden gate, perfectly legally, to their neighbors, we've stuck on there. We started with four, and we've now got 64 on, and the result of that was that people were then going into shops asking for a local Todmorden egg, and the result of that was, some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got of free range birds, and then they went on to meat birds, and although these are really, really small steps, that increasing local economic confidence is starting to play out in a number of ways, and we now have farmers doing cheese and they've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs, they're doing pasties and pies and things that they would have never done before.
We've got increasing market stalls selling local food, and in a survey that local students did for us, 49 percent of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line had increased because of what we were actually doing.
And we're just volunteers and it's only an experiment.
Now, none of this is rocket science.
It certainly is not clever, and it's not original.
But it is joined up, and it is inclusive.
This is not a movement for those people that are going to sort themselves out anyway.
This is a movement for everyone.
We have a motto: If you eat, you're in.
Across age, across income, across culture.
It's been really quite a roller coaster experience, but going back to that first question that we asked, is it replicable? Yeah. It most certainly is replicable.
More than 30 towns in England now are spinning the Incredible Edible plate.
Whichever way they want to do it, of their own volition, they're trying to make their own lives differently, and worldwide, we've got communities across America and Japan -- it's incredible, isn't it? I mean, America and Japan and New Zealand.
People after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness around local growing into the heart of Christchurch.
And none of this takes more money and none of this demands a bureaucracy, but it does demand that you think things differently and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs in order to create that supportive framework that communities can bounce off.
And there's some great ideas already in our patch.
Our local authority has decided to make everywhere Incredible Edible, and in support of that have decided to do two things.
First, they're going to create an asset register of spare land that they've got, put it in a food bank so that communities can use that wherever they live, and they're going to underpin that with a license.
And then they've said to every single one of their workforce, if you can, help those communities grow, and help them to maintain their spaces.
Suddenly, we're seeing actions on the ground from local government. We're seeing this mainstreamed.
We are responding creatively at last to what Rio demanded of us, and there's lots more you could do.
I mean, just to list a few. One, please stop putting prickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space.
Secondly, please create -- please, please create edible landscapes so that our children start to walk past their food day in, day out, on our high streets, in our parks, wherever that might be.
Inspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart of the town and the city plan, not relegate them to the edges of the settlements that nobody can see.
Encourage all our schools to take this seriously.
This isn't a second class exercise.
If we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow, then please let us say to every school, create a sense of purpose around the importance to the environment, local food and soils.
Put that at the heart of your school culture, and you will create a different generation.
There are so many things you can do, but ultimately this is about something really simple.
Through an organic process, through an increasing recognition of the power of small actions, we are starting, at last, to believe in ourselves again, and to believe in our capacity, each and every one of us, to build a different and a kinder future, and in my book, that's incredible.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

<title>Pam Warhurst: How we can eat our landscapes</title>
<description>What should a community do with its unused land? Plant food, of course. With energy and humor, Pam Warhurst tells at the TEDSalon the story of how she and a growing team of volunteers came together to turn plots of unused land into communal vegetable gardens, and to change the narrative of food in their community.</description>
<keywords>agriculture,botany,community,food,green,sustainability</keywords>

Well, this is such an honor. And it's wonderful to be in the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world.
And I'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today.
And I'm also rather surprised, because when I look back on my life the last thing I ever wanted to do was write, or be in any way involved in religion.
After I left my convent, I'd finished with religion, frankly.
I thought that was it.
And for 13 years I kept clear of it. I wanted to be an English literature professor.
And I certainly didn't even want to be a writer, particularly.
But then I suffered a series of career catastrophes, one after the other, and finally found myself in television.
I said that to Bill Moyers, and he said, "Oh, we take anybody."
And I was doing some rather controversial religious programs.
This went down very well in the U.K., where religion is extremely unpopular.
And so, for once, for the only time in my life, I was finally in the mainstream.
But I got sent to Jerusalem to make a film about early Christianity.
And there, for the first time, I encountered the other religious traditions: Judaism and Islam, the sister religions of Christianity.
And while I found I knew nothing about these faiths at all -- despite my own intensely religious background, I'd seen Judaism only as a kind of prelude to Christianity, and I knew nothing about Islam at all.
But in that city, that tortured city, where you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together, you also become aware of the profound connection between them.
And it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back to a sense of what religion can be, and actually enabled me to look at my own faith in a different light.
And I found some astonishing things in the course of my study that had never occurred to me. Frankly, in the days when I thought I'd had it with religion, I just found the whole thing absolutely incredible.
These doctrines seemed unproven, abstract.
And to my astonishment, when I began seriously studying other traditions, I began to realize that belief -- which we make such a fuss about today -- is only a very recent religious enthusiasm that surfaced only in the West, in about the 17th century.
The word "belief" itself originally meant to love, to prize, to hold dear.
In the 17th century, it narrowed its focus, for reasons that I'm exploring in a book I'm writing at the moment, to include -- to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions, a credo.
"I believe:" it did not mean, "I accept certain creedal articles of faith."
It meant: "I commit myself. I engage myself."
Indeed, some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy.
In the Quran, religious opinion -- religious orthodoxy -- is dismissed as "zanna:" self-indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other, but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian.
So if religion is not about believing things, what is it about?
What I've found, across the board, is that religion is about behaving differently.
Instead of deciding whether or not you believe in God, first you do something.
You behave in a committed way, and then you begin to understand the truths of religion.
And religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action; you only understand them when you put them into practice.
Now, pride of place in this practice is given to compassion.
And it is an arresting fact that right across the board, in every single one of the major world faiths, compassion -- the ability to feel with the other in the way we've been thinking about this evening -- is not only the test of any true religiosity, it is also what will bring us into the presence of what Jews, Christians and Muslims call "God" or the "Divine."
It is compassion, says the Buddha, which brings you to Nirvana.
Why? Because in compassion, when we feel with the other, we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there. And once we get rid of ego, then we're ready to see the Divine.
And in particular, every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted -- has said -- and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the Golden Rule.
First propounded by Confucius five centuries before Christ: "Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
That, he said, was the central thread which ran through all his teaching and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day.
And it was -- the Golden Rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called "ren," human-heartedness, which was a transcendent experience in itself.
And this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms, too.
There's a famous story about the great rabbi, Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus.
A pagan came to him and offered to convert to Judaism if the rabbi could recite the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg.
Hillel stood on one leg and said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah. The rest is commentary.
Go and study it."
And "go and study it" was what he meant.
He said, "In your exegesis, you must make it clear that every single verse of the Torah is a commentary, a gloss upon the Golden Rule."
The great Rabbi Meir said that any interpretation of Scripture which led to hatred and disdain, or contempt of other people -- any people whatsoever -- was illegitimate.
Saint Augustine made exactly the same point.
Scripture, he says, "teaches nothing but charity, and we must not leave an interpretation of Scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it."
And this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather rebarbative texts is a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life.
But now look at our world. And we are living in a world that is -- where religion has been hijacked. Where terrorists cite Quranic verses to justify their atrocities.
Where instead of taking Jesus' words, "Love your enemies.
Don't judge others," we have the spectacle of Christians endlessly judging other people, endlessly using Scripture as a way of arguing with other people, putting other people down. Throughout the ages, religion has been used to oppress others, and this is because of human ego, human greed.
We have a talent as a species for messing up wonderful things.
So the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point, I think -- that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group: your own nation, your own co-religionists, your own fellow countrymen. You must have what one of the Chinese sages called "jian ai": concern for everybody. Love your enemies. Honor the stranger.
We formed you, says the Quran, into tribes and nations so that you may know one another.
And this, again -- this universal outreach -- is getting subdued in the strident use of religion -- abuse of religion -- for nefarious gains.
Now, I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who, when I say to them what I do for a living, inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history. Wrong.
The causes of our present woes are political.
But, make no mistake about it, religion is a kind of fault line, and when a conflict gets ingrained in a region, religion can get sucked in and become part of the problem. Our modernity has been exceedingly violent.
Between 1914 and 1945, 70 million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict.
And so many of our institutions, even football, which used to be a pleasant pastime, now causes riots where people even die.
And it's not surprising that religion, too, has been affected by this violent ethos.
There's also a great deal, I think, of religious illiteracy around.
People seem to think, now equate religious faith with believing things.
As though that -- we call religious people often believers, as though that were the main thing that they do. And very often, secondary goals get pushed into the first place, in place of compassion and the Golden Rule.
Because the Golden Rule is difficult. I sometimes -- when I'm speaking to congregations about compassion, I sometimes see a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because a lot of religious people prefer to be right, rather than compassionate.
Now -- but that's not the whole story.
Since September the 11th, when my work on Islam suddenly propelled me into public life, in a way that I'd never imagined, I've been able to sort of go all over the world, and finding, everywhere I go, a yearning for change.
I've just come back from Pakistan, where literally thousands of people came to my lectures, because they were yearning, first of all, to hear a friendly Western voice.
And especially the young people were coming. And were asking me -- the young people were saying, "What can we do? What can we do to change things?"
And my hosts in Pakistan said, "Look, don't be too polite to us.
Tell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing."
Because it seems to me that with -- our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time.
And religion, with its wide following ... Here in the United States, people may be being religious in a different way, as a report has just shown -- but they still want to be religious. It's only Western Europe that has retained its secularism, which is now beginning to look rather endearingly old-fashioned.
But people want to be religious, and religion should be made to be a force for harmony in the world, which it can and should be -- because of the Golden Rule.
"Do not do to others what you would not have them do to you": an ethos that should now be applied globally.
We should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves.
And these -- whatever our wretched beliefs -- is a religious matter, it's a spiritual matter.
It's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage us all.
And as I say, there is a hunger for change out there.
Here in the United States, I think you see it in this election campaign: a longing for change.
And people in churches all over and mosques all over this continent after September the 11th, coming together locally to create networks of understanding.
With the mosque, with the synagogue, saying, "We must start to speak to one another."
I think it's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration and move toward appreciation of the other.
I'd -- there's one story I'd just like to mention.
This comes from "The Iliad." But it tells you what this spirituality should be.
You know the story of "The Iliad," the 10-year war between Greece and Troy.
In one incident, Achilles, the famous warrior of Greece, takes his troops out of the war, and the whole war effort suffers. And in the course of the ensuing muddle, his beloved friend, Patroclus, is killed -- and killed in single combat by one of the Trojan princes, Hector. And Achilles goes mad with grief and rage and revenge, and he mutilates the body. He kills Hector, he mutilates his body and then he refuses to give the body back for burial to the family, which means that, in Greek ethos, Hector's soul will wander eternally, lost.
And then one night, Priam, king of Troy, an old man, comes into the Greek camp incognito, makes his way to Achilles' tent to ask for the body of his son.
And everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself.
And Achilles looks at him and thinks of his father. And he starts to weep.
And Priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons, and he, too, starts to weep. And the sound of their weeping filled the house.
The Greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people.
And then Achilles takes the body of Hector, he hands it very tenderly to the father, and the two men look at each other, and see each other as divine.
That is the ethos found, too, in all the religions.
It's what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies, and beginning to appreciate the other.
It's of great importance that the word for "holy" in Hebrew, applied to God, is "Kadosh": separate, other.
And it is often, perhaps, the very otherness of our enemies which can give us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is God.
And now, here's my wish: I wish that you would help with the creation, launch and propagation of a Charter for Compassion, crafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from the three Abrahamic traditions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and based on the fundamental principle of the Golden Rule.
We need to create a movement among all these people that I meet in my travels -- you probably meet, too -- who want to join up, in some way, and reclaim their faith, which they feel, as I say, has been hijacked.
We need to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos, and to give guidelines. This Charter would not be a massive document.
I'd like to see it -- to give guidelines as to how to interpret the Scriptures, these texts that are being abused. Remember what the rabbis and what Augustine said about how Scripture should be governed by the principle of charity.
Let's get back to that. And the idea, too, of Jews, Christians and Muslims -- these traditions now so often at loggerheads -- working together to create a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand, at least, of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world.
And you are the people. I'm just a solitary scholar.
Despite the idea that I love a good time, which I was rather amazed to see coming up on me -- I actually spend a great deal of time alone, studying, and I'm not very -- you're the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody, everybody on the planet. I've had some preliminary talks, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, for example, is very happy to give his name to this, as is Imam Feisal Rauf, the Imam in New York City.
Also, I would be working with the Alliance of Civilizations at the United Nations.
I was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations, which was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism, and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism.
And the Alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it.
The importance of this is that this is -- I can see some of you starting to look worried, because you think it's a slow and cumbersome body -- but what the United Nations can do is give us some neutrality, so that this isn't seen as a Western or a Christian initiative, but that it's coming, as it were, from the United Nations, from the world -- who would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this.
And so I do urge you to join me in making -- in this charter -- to building this charter, launching it and propagating it so that it becomes -- I'd like to see it in every college, every church, every mosque, every synagogue in the world, so that people can look at their tradition, reclaim it, and make religion a source of peace in the world, which it can and should be. Thank you very much.

When we talk about corruption, there are typical types of individuals that spring to mind.
There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs.
Saparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them.
Until his death in 2006, he was the all-powerful leader of Turkmenistan, a Central Asian country rich in natural gas.
Now, he really loved to issue presidential decrees.
And one renamed the months of the year including after himself and his mother.
He spent millions of dollars creating a bizarre personality cult, and his crowning glory was the building of a 40-foot-high gold-plated statue of himself which stood proudly in the capital's central square and rotated to follow the sun.
He was a slightly unusual guy.
And then there's that cliché, the African dictator or minister or official.
There's Teodorín Obiang.
So his daddy is president for life of Equatorial Guinea, a West African nation that has exported billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s and yet has a truly appalling human rights record.
The vast majority of its people are living in really miserable poverty despite an income per capita that's on a par with that of Portugal.
So Obiang junior, well, he buys himself a $30 million mansion in Malibu, California.
I've been up to its front gates.
I can tell you it's a magnificent spread.
He bought an €18 million art collection that used to belong to fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, a stack of fabulous sports cars, some costing a million dollars apiece -- oh, and a Gulfstream jet, too.
Now get this: Until recently, he was earning an official monthly salary of less than 7,000 dollars.
And there's Dan Etete.
Well, he was the former oil minister of Nigeria under President Abacha, and it just so happens he's a convicted money launderer too.
We've spent a great deal of time investigating a $1 billion -- that's right, a $1 billion — oil deal that he was involved with, and what we found was pretty shocking, but more about that later.
So it's easy to think that corruption happens somewhere over there, carried out by a bunch of greedy despots and individuals up to no good in countries that we, personally, may know very little about and feel really unconnected to and unaffected by what might be going on.
But does it just happen over there?
Well, at 22, I was very lucky.
My first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African ivory.
And that's how my relationship with corruption really began.
In 1993, with two friends who were colleagues, Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley, we set up an organization called Global Witness.
Our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in Cambodia.
So a few years later, and it's now 1997, and I'm in Angola undercover investigating blood diamonds.
Perhaps you saw the film, the Hollywood film "Blood Diamond," the one with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Well, some of that sprang from our work.
Luanda, it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the streets, and a tiny, very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to Brazil and Portugal.
And it was a slightly crazy place.
So I'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room feeling just totally overwhelmed.
But it wasn't about blood diamonds.
Because I'd been speaking to lots of people there who, well, they talked about a different problem: that of a massive web of corruption on a global scale and millions of oil dollars going missing.
And for what was then a very small organization of just a few people, trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that was an enormous challenge.
And in the years that I've been, and we've all been campaigning and investigating, I've repeatedly seen that what makes corruption on a global, massive scale possible, well it isn't just greed or the misuse of power or that nebulous phrase "weak governance."
I mean, yes, it's all of those, but corruption, it's made possible by the actions of global facilitators.
So let's go back to some of those people I talked about earlier.
Now, they're all people we've investigated, and they're all people who couldn't do what they do alone.
Take Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end up with high-end art and luxury houses without help.
He did business with global banks.
A bank in Paris held accounts of companies controlled by him, one of which was used to buy the art, and American banks, well, they funneled 73 million dollars into the States, some of which was used to buy that California mansion.
And he didn't do all of this in his own name either.
He used shell companies.
He used one to buy the property, and another, which was in somebody else's name, to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place.
And then there's Dan Etete.
Well, when he was oil minister, he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars to a company that, guess what, yeah, he was the hidden owner of.
Now, it was then much later traded on with the kind assistance of the Nigerian government -- now I have to be careful what I say here — to subsidiaries of Shell and the Italian Eni, two of the biggest oil companies around.
So the reality is, is that the engine of corruption, well, it exists far beyond the shores of countries like Equatorial Guinea or Nigeria or Turkmenistan.
This engine, well, it's driven by our international banking system, by the problem of anonymous shell companies, and by the secrecy that we have afforded big oil, gas and mining operations, and, most of all, by the failure of our politicians to back up their rhetoric and do something really meaningful and systemic to tackle this stuff.
Now let's take the banks first.
Well, it's not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept dirty money, but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too.
For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.
Now this region, it has just five percent of its forests left intact. Five percent.
So how did that happen?
Well, because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years.
So we sent an undercover investigator in to secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite, and the resulting footage, well, it made some people very angry, and you can see that on YouTube, but it proved what we had long suspected, because it showed how the state's chief minister, despite his later denials, used his control over land and forest licenses to enrich himself and his family.
And HSBC, well, we know that HSBC bankrolled the region's largest logging companies that were responsible for some of that destruction in Sarawak and elsewhere.
The bank violated its own sustainability policies in the process, but it earned around 130 million dollars.
Now shortly after our exposé, very shortly after our exposé earlier this year, the bank announced a policy review on this.
And is this progress? Maybe, but we're going to be keeping a very close eye on that case.
And then there's the problem of anonymous shell companies.
Well, we've all heard about what they are, I think, and we all know they're used quite a bit by people and companies who are trying to avoid paying their proper dues to society, also known as taxes.
But what doesn't usually come to light is how shell companies are used to steal huge sums of money, transformational sums of money, from poor countries.
In virtually every case of corruption that we've investigated, shell companies have appeared, and sometimes it's been impossible to find out who is really involved in the deal.
A recent study by the World Bank looked at 200 cases of corruption.
It found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies, totaling almost 56 billion dollars.
Now many of these companies were in America or the United Kingdom, its overseas territories and Crown dependencies, and so it's not just an offshore problem, it's an on-shore one too.
You see, shell companies, they're central to the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites rather than ordinary citizens.
One striking recent case that we've investigated is how the government in the Democratic Republic of Congo sold off a series of valuable, state-owned mining assets to shell companies in the British Virgin Islands.
So we spoke to sources in country, trawled through company documents and other information trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal.
And we were alarmed to find that these shell companies had quickly flipped many of the assets on for huge profits to major international mining companies listed in London.
Now, the Africa Progress Panel, led by Kofi Annan, they've calculated that Congo may have lost more than 1.3 billion dollars from these deals.
That's almost twice the country's annual health and education budget combined.
And will the people of Congo, will they ever get their money back?
Well, the answer to that question, and who was really involved and what really happened, well that's going to probably remain locked away in the secretive company registries of the British Virgin Islands and elsewhere unless we all do something about it.
And how about the oil, gas and mining companies?
Okay, maybe it's a bit of a cliché to talk about them.
Corruption in that sector, no surprise.
There's corruption everywhere, so why focus on that sector?
Well, because there's a lot at stake.
In 2011, natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Nineteen to one.
Now that's a hell of a lot of schools and universities and hospitals and business startups, many of which haven't materialized and never will because some of that money has simply been stolen away.
Now let's go back to the oil and mining companies, and let's go back to Dan Etete and that $1 billion deal.
And now forgive me, I'm going to read the next bit because it's a very live issue, and our lawyers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right.
Now, on the surface, the deal appeared straightforward.
Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni paid the Nigerian government for the block.
The Nigerian government transferred precisely the same amount, to the very dollar, to an account earmarked for a shell company whose hidden owner was Etete.
Now, that's not bad going for a convicted money launderer.
And here's the thing.
After many months of digging around and reading through hundreds of pages of court documents, we found evidence that, in fact, Shell and Eni had known that the funds would be transferred to that shell company, and frankly, it's hard to believe they didn't know who they were really dealing with there.
Now, it just shouldn't take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went.
I mean, these are state assets.
They're supposed to be used for the benefit of the people in the country.
But in some countries, citizens and journalists who are trying to expose stories like this have been harassed and arrested and some have even risked their lives to do so.
And finally, well, there are those who believe that corruption is unavoidable.
It's just how some business is done.
It's too complex and difficult to change.
So in effect, what? We just accept it.
But as a campaigner and investigator, I have a different view, because I've seen what can happen when an idea gains momentum.
In the oil and mining sector, for example, there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems.
In 1999, when Global Witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent, well, some people laughed at the extreme naiveté of that small idea.
But literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transparency, and now it's fast becoming the norm and the law.
Two thirds of the value of the world's oil and mining companies are now covered by transparency laws. Two thirds.
So this is change happening.
This is progress.
But we're not there yet, by far.
Because it really isn't about corruption somewhere over there, is it?
In a globalized world, corruption is a truly globalized business, and one that needs global solutions, supported and pushed by us all, as global citizens, right here.
Thank you.

I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today.
I began "The Vagina Monologues" because I was worried about vaginas.
I'm very worried today about this notion, this world, this prevailing kind of force of security.
I see this word, hear this word, feel this word everywhere.
Real security, security checks, security watch, security clearance.
Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure?
What does anyone mean when they talk about real security?
And why have we, as Americans particularly, become a nation that strives for security above all else?
In fact, I think that security is elusive. It's impossible.
We all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us.
People change us. Nothing is secure.
And that's actually the good news.
This is, of course, unless your whole life is about being secure.
I think that when that is the focus of your life, these are the things that happen.
You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle.
You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time, as they might confuse you or challenge you.
You can't open yourself to new experiences, new people, new ways of doing things -- they might take you off course.
You can't not know who you are, so you cling to hard-matter identity.
You become a Christian, Muslim, Jew.
You're an Indian, Egyptian, Italian, American.
You're a heterosexual or a homosexual, or you never have sex.
Or at least, that's what you say when you identify yourself.
You become part of an "us."
In order to be secure, you defend against "them."
You cling to your land because it is your secure place.
You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it.
You become your nation. You become your religion.
You become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you and protect you from doubt or change.
But all this does, actually, is shut down your mind.
In reality, it does not really make you safer.
I was in Sri Lanka, for example, three days after the tsunami, and I was standing on the beaches and it was absolutely clear that, in a matter of five minutes, a 30-foot wave could rise up and desecrate a people, a population and lives.
All this striving for security, in fact, has made you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time.
There are people not like you -- people who you now call enemies.
You have places you cannot go, thoughts you cannot think, worlds that you can no longer inhabit.
And so you spend your days fighting things off, defending your territory and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking.
Your days become devoted to protecting yourself.
This becomes your mission. That is all you do.
Ideas get shorter. They become sound bytes.
There are evildoers and saints, criminals and victims.
There are those who, if they're not with us, are against us.
It gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them.
It gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them, occupy them, invade them and kill them, because they are only obstacles now to your security.
In six years, I've had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day, a global movement against [violence against] women, to travel probably to 60 countries, and spend a great deal of time in different portions.
I've met women and men all over this planet, who through various circumstances -- war, poverty, racism, multiple forms of violence -- have never known security, or have had their illusion of security forever devastated.
I've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban, who were essentially brutalized and censored.
I've been in Bosnian refugee camps.
I was with women in Pakistan who have had their faces melted off with acid.
I've been with girls all across America who were date-raped, or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night.
One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species.
I loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world.
I've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world, we call Vagina Warriors.
These particular people, rather than getting AK-47s, or weapons of mass destruction, or machetes, in the spirit of the warrior, have gone into the center, the heart of pain, of loss.
They have grieved it, they have died into it, and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine.
They have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy towards another mission and another trajectory.
These warriors now devote themselves and their lives to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else.
There are thousands if not millions of them on the planet.
I venture there are many in this room.
They have a fierceness and a freedom that I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm.
They have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator.
Their own personal security is not their end goal, and because of that, because, rather than worrying about security, because the transformation of suffering is their end goal, I actually believe they are creating real safety and a whole new idea of security.
I want to talk about a few of these people that I've met.
Tomorrow, I am going to Cairo, and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo who are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house for battered women in the Middle East.
That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line, and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt, and were willing to be attacked and criticized.
And through their work over the last years, this is not only happening that this house is opening, but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it.
Women in Uganda this year, who put on "The Vagina Monologues" during V-Day, actually evoked the wrath of the government.
And, I love this story so much.
There was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents to talk about whether "Vaginas" could come to Uganda.
And in this meeting -- it went on for weeks in the press, two weeks where there was huge discussion.
The government finally made a decision that "The Vagina Monologues" could not be performed in Uganda.
But the amazing news was that because they had stood up, these women, and because they had been willing to risk their security, it began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda, but all of Africa.
As a result, this production, which had already sold out, every single person in that 800-seat audience, except for 10 people, made a decision to keep the money.
They raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred.
There's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota.
She's a high school student.
She had seen "The Vagina Monologues" and she was really moved. And as a result, she wore an "I heart my vagina" button to her high school in Minnesota.
She was basically threatened to be expelled from school.
They told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school, that it was not a legal thing, that it was not a moral thing, that it was not a good thing.
So she really struggled with this, what to do, because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together -- I believe it was 100, 150 students all wore "I love my vagina" T-shirts, and the boys wore "I love her vagina" T-shirts to school.
Now this seems like a fairly, you know, frivolous, but what happened as a result of that, is that that school now is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex, it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly.
I know I've talked about Agnes here before, but I want to give you an update on Agnes.
I met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley.
When she was a young girl, she had been mutilated against her will.
That mutilation of her clitoris had actually obviously impacted her life and changed it in a way that was devastating.
She made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard, but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls.
For eight years, she walked through the Rift Valley.
She had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman's body in it, a half a torso, and she would teach people, everywhere she went, what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like.
In the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers.
She saved 1,500 girls from being cut.
When V-Day met her, we asked her how we could support her and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep, I could get around a lot faster." So, we bought her a Jeep.
In the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.
So, we said, what else could we do?
She said, "If you help me get money, I could open a house."
Three years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation.
When she began her mission eight years ago, she was reviled, she was detested, she was completely slandered in her community.
I am proud to tell you that six months ago, she was elected the deputy mayor of Narok.
I think what I'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security, and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people, but you make yourself far more insecure.
Real security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist.
Not running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow.
Real security is not knowing something, when you don't know it.
Real security is hungering for connection rather than power.
It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.
It is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter-bended, and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere.
Real security is not only being able to tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them and only trusting a situation when they are present.
Something happened when I began traveling in V-Day, eight years ago. I got lost.
I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa, and I had no idea where I was.
I didn't know where I was going, where I'd come from, and I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack.
And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter where I was going, or where I had come from because we are all essentially permanently displaced people.
All of us are refugees.
We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time, moving towards a new place.
Freedom means I may not be identified as any one group, but that I can visit and find myself in every group.
It does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs, but it does mean I am not hardened around them.
I do not use them as weapons.
In the shared future, it will be just that, shared.
The end goal will [be] becoming vulnerable, realizing the place of our connection to one another, rather than becoming secure, in control and alone.
Thank you very much.
And how are you doing? Are you exhausted?
On a typical day, do you wake up with hope or gloom?
Eve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century, we have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time.
And I think part of what I'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief.
And I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping, and then moving on, I'm fine.
When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me, and isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble.
Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place, country to country, and city to city, the degree to which women, for example, are violated, and the epidemic of it, and the kind of ordinariness of it, is so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time, or I have to take the time now, to process that.
There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about, you know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one.
Why this one?
EE: I think that if you think about women, women are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth, we come from them, they are mothers, they are visionaries, they are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says that one out of three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in their lifetime, we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet, we're talking about the place where we come from, we're talking about parenting.
Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child.
How does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future, or thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women, it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself.

Now, I want to start with a question: When was the last time you were called childish?
For kids like me, being called childish can be a frequent occurrence.
Every time we make irrational demands, exhibit irresponsible behavior or display any other signs of being normal American citizens, we are called childish.
Which really bothers me.
After all, take a look at these events: Imperialism and colonization, world wars, George W. Bush.
Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.
Now, what have kids done?
Well, Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust, Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States, and, most recently, Charlie Simpson helped to raise 120,000 pounds for Haiti on his little bike.
So, as you can see evidenced by such examples, age has absolutely nothing to do with it.
The traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age-discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking.
Thank you.
Then again, who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs?
Maybe you've had grand plans before but stopped yourself, thinking, "That's impossible," or, "That costs too much," or, "That won't benefit me."
For better or worse, we kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things.
Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking.
Like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were a free kind of utopia.
How many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities?
Sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals can be a burden because you know that if everything were free, then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos.
On the other hand, we kids still dream about perfection.
And that's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality, you have to dream about it first.
In many ways, our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility.
For instance, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington, my home state -- yoohoo Washington!
-- has a program called Kids Design Glass, and kids draw their own ideas for glass art.
Now, the resident artist said they got some of their best ideas through the program because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes; they just think of good ideas.
Now, when you think of glass, you might think of colorful Chihuly designs or maybe Italian vases, but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that into the realm of broken-hearted snakes and bacon boys, who you can see has meat vision.
Now, our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insider's knowledge.
Kids already do a lot of learning from adults, and we have a lot to share.
I think that adults should start learning from kids.
Now, I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd, teachers and students, and I like this analogy: It shouldn't just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students, "Do this, do that."
The students should teach their teachers.
Learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal.
The reality, unfortunately, is a little different, and it has a lot to do with trust, or a lack of it.
Now, if you don't trust someone, you place restrictions on them, right?
If I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the 10 percent interest I established on her last loan, I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back.
True story, by the way.
Now, adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every "don't do that, don't do this" in the school handbook to restrictions on school Internet use.
As history points out, regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control.
And although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes, kids have no, or very little say in making the rules, when really the attitude should be reciprocal, meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population.
Now, what's even worse than restriction is that adults often underestimate kids abilities.
We love challenges, but when expectations are low, trust me, we will sink to them.
My own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister.
Okay, so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that, but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ fighters when lots of other kids were hearing "The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round."
Well, we heard that one too, but "Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules.
I loved to write from the age of four, and when I was six my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word.
Thank you Bill Gates and thank you Ma.
I wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop, and I wanted to get published.
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published or saying wait until you're older, my parents were really supportive.
Many publishers were not quite so encouraging, one large children's publisher ironically saying that they didn't work with children -- children's publisher not working with children?
I don't know, you're kind of alienating a large client there.
Now, one publisher, Action Publishing, was willing to take that leap and trust me and to listen to what I had to say.
They published my first book, "Flying Fingers," -- you see it here -- and from there on, it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools, keynoting to thousands of educators and finally, today, speaking to you.
I appreciate your attention today, because to show that you truly care, you listen.
But there's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults.
Kids grow up and become adults just like you.
Or just like you? Really?
The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult, but rather better adults than you have been, which may be a little challenging considering your guys' credentials .
But the way progress happens is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones.
It's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore.
No matter your position or place in life, it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away.
Adults and fellow TEDsters, you need to listen and learn from kids and trust us and expect more from us.
You must lend an ear today, because we are the leaders of tomorrow, which means we're going to be taking care of you when you're old and senile. No, just kidding.
No, really, we are going to be the next generation, the ones who will bring this world forward.
And in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you, remember that cloning is possible, and that involves going through childhood again, in which case you'll want to be heard just like my generation.
Now, the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas.
Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed.
Are you ready to make the match?
Because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

I have a daughter, Mulan.
And when she was eight, last year, she was doing a report for school or she had some homework about frogs.
And we were at this restaurant, and she said, "So, basically, frogs lay eggs and the eggs turn into tadpoles, and tadpoles turn into frogs."
And I said, "Yeah. You know, I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much.
It's the females, I think, that lay the eggs, and then the males fertilize them.
And then they become tadpoles and frogs."
And she says, "What? Only the females have eggs?"
And I said, "Yeah."
And she goes, "And what's this fertilizing?"
So I kind of said, "Oh, it's this extra ingredient, you know, that you need to create a new frog from the mom and dad frog."
And she said, "Oh, so is that true for humans too?"
And I thought, "Okay, here we go."
I didn't know it would happen so quick, at eight.
I was trying to remember all the guidebooks, and all I could remember was, "Only answer the question they're asking.
Don't give any more information."
So I said, "Yes."
And she said, "And where do, um, where do human women, like, where do women lay their eggs?"
And I said, "Well, funny you should ask.
We have evolved to have our own pond.
We have our very own pond inside our bodies.
And we lay our eggs there, we don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that.
It's our own pond. And that's how it happens."
And she goes, "Then how do they get fertilized?"
And I said, "Well, Men, through their penis, they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out.
And you go through the woman's vagina."
And so we're just eating, and her jaw just drops, and she goes, "Mom!
Like, where you go to the bathroom?"
And I said, "I know.
I know."
That's how we evolved. It does seem odd.
It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park ...
Bad zoning, but ..."
She's like, "What?" And she goes, "But Mom, but men and women can't ever see each other naked, Mom.
So how could that ever happen?"
And then I go, "Well," and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on.
"Human males and females develop a special bond, and when they're much older, much, much older than you, and they have a very special feeling, then they can be naked together."
And she said, "Mom, have you done this before?"
And I said, "Yes."
And she said, "But Mom, you can't have kids."
Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids.
And I said, "Yes."
And she said, "Well, you don't have to do that again."
And I said, "..."
And then she said, "But how does it happen when a man and woman are together?
Like, how do they know that's the time?
Mom, does the man just say, 'Is now the time to take off my pants?'" And I said, "Yes."
"That is exactly right.
That's exactly how it happens."
So we're driving home and she's looking out the window, and she goes, "Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street, like a man and a woman, they just started doing it. Would that ever happen?"
And I said, "Oh, no. Humans are so private.
Oh ..."
And then she goes, "What if there was like a party, and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys, and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it, Mom?
Would that ever happen?"
And I said, "Oh, no, no.
That's not how we do it."
Then we got home and we see the cat. And she goes, "Mom, how do cats do it?"
And I go, "Oh, it's the same. It's basically the same."
And then she got all caught up in the legs. "But how would the legs go, Mom?
I don't understand the legs."
She goes, "Mom, everyone can't do the splits."
And I go, "I know, but the legs ..."
and I'm probably like, "The legs get worked out."
And she goes, "But I just can't understand it."
So I go, "You know, why don't we go on the Internet, and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia."
So we go online, and we put in "cats mating."
And, unfortunately, on YouTube, there's many cats mating videos.
And we watched them and I'm so thankful, because she's just like, "Wow! This is so amazing."
She goes, "What about dogs?"
So we put in dogs mating, and, you know, we're watching it, and she's totally absorbed.
And then she goes, "Mom, do you think they would have, on the Internet, any humans mating?"
And then I realized that I had taken my little eight year old's hand, and taken her right into Internet porn.
And I looked into this trusting, loving face, and I said, "Oh, no.
That would never happen."
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. I'm so happy to be here.
<title>Julia Sweeney: It's time for "The Talk"</title>
<description>Despite her best efforts, comedian Julia Sweeney is forced to tell a little white lie when her 8-year-old begins learning about frog reproduction -- and starts to ask some very smart questions.</description>

If I should have a daughter, instead of "Mom," she's gonna call me "Point B," because that way she knows that no matter what happens, at least she can always find her way to me.
And I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say, "Oh, I know that like the back of my hand."
And she's going to learn that this life will hit you hard in the face, wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach.
But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air.
There is hurt, here, that cannot be fixed by Band-Aids or poetry.
So the first time she realizes that Wonder Woman isn't coming, I'll make sure she knows she doesn't have to wear the cape all by herself because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers, your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal.
Believe me, I've tried.
"And, baby," I'll tell her, don't keep your nose up in the air like that.
I know that trick; I've done it a million times.
You're just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house, so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him.
Or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place, to see if you can change him."
But I know she will anyway, so instead I'll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boots nearby, because there is no heartbreak that chocolate can't fix.
Okay, there's a few heartbreaks that chocolate can't fix.
But that's what the rain boots are for, because rain will wash away everything, if you let it.
I want her to look at the world through the underside of a glass-bottom boat, to look through a microscope at the galaxies that exist on the pinpoint of a human mind, because that's the way my mom taught me.
That there'll be days like this.
There'll be days like this, my momma said. When you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises; when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you want to save are the ones standing on your cape; when your boots will fill with rain, and you'll be up to your knees in disappointment.
And those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you.
Because there's nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline, no matter how many times it's sent away.
You will put the wind in winsome, lose some.
You will put the star in starting over, and over.
And no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute, be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life.
And yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting, I am pretty damn naive.
But I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar.
It can crumble so easily, but don't be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.
"Baby," I'll tell her, "remember, your momma is a worrier, and your poppa is a warrior, and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more."
Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things.
And always apologize when you've done something wrong, but don't you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining.
Your voice is small, but don't ever stop singing.
And when they finally hand you heartache, when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on street-corners of cynicism and defeat, you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
All right, so I want you to take a moment, and I want you to think of three things that you know to be true.
They can be about whatever you want -- technology, entertainment, design, your family, what you had for breakfast.
The only rule is don't think too hard.
Okay, ready? Go.
Okay.
So here are three things I know to be true.
I know that Jean-Luc Godard was right when he said that, "a good story has a beginning, a middle and an end, although not necessarily in that order."
I know that I'm incredibly nervous and excited to be up here, which is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool.
And I know that I have been waiting all week to tell this joke.
Why was the scarecrow invited to TED?
Because he was out standing in his field.
I'm sorry.
Okay, so these are three things I know to be true.
But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding.
So I write poems to figure things out.
Sometimes the only way I know how to work through something is by writing a poem.
And sometimes I get to the end of the poem and look back and go, "Oh, that's what this is all about," and sometimes I get to the end of the poem and haven't solved anything, but at least I have a new poem out of it.
Spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry.
I tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn't just want to sit on paper, that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person.
When I was a freshman in high school, I was a live wire of nervous hormones.
And I was underdeveloped and over-excitable.
And despite my fear of ever being looked at for too long, I was fascinated by the idea of spoken word poetry.
I felt that my two secret loves, poetry and theatre, had come together, had a baby, a baby I needed to get to know.
So I decided to give it a try.
My first spoken word poem, packed with all the wisdom of a 14-year-old, was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine.
The poem was very indignant, and mainly exaggerated, but the only spoken word poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indignant, so I thought that that's what was expected of me.
The first time that I performed, the audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy, and when I came off the stage I was shaking.
I felt this tap on my shoulder, and I turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd.
She was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand, but instead she just nodded at me and said, "Hey, I really felt that. Thanks."
And lightning struck.
I was hooked.
I discovered this bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side that hosted a weekly poetry open mic, and my bewildered, but supportive, parents took me to soak in every ounce of spoken word that I could.
I was the youngest by at least a decade, but somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club didn't seem bothered by the 14-year-old wandering about -- if fact, they welcomed me.
And it was here, listening to these poets share their stories, that I learned that spoken word poetry didn't have to be indignant, it could be fun or painful or serious or silly.
The Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home, and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well.
Never mind the fact that I was 14 -- they told me, "Write about being 14."
So I did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant, grown-up poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me, "Hey, I really felt that too."
Now I can divide my spoken word journey into three steps.
Step one was the moment I said, "I can. I can do this."
And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.
Step two was the moment I said, "I will. I will continue.
I love spoken word. I will keep coming back week after week."
And step three began when I realized that I didn't have to write poems that were indignant, if that's not what I was.
There were things that were specific to me, and the more that I focused on those things, the weirder my poetry got, but the more that it felt like mine.
It's not just the adage "write what you know."
It's about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience you've collected up to now to help you dive into the things you don't know.
I use poetry to help me work through what I don't understand, but I show up to each new poem with a backpack full of everywhere else that I've been.
When I got to university, I met a fellow poet who shared my belief in the magic of spoken word poetry.
And actually, Phil Kaye and I coincidentally also share the same last name.
When I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E.
as a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me.
But Phil and I decided to reinvent Project V.O.I.C.E. -- this time changing the mission to using spoken word poetry as a way to entertain, educate and inspire.
We stayed full-time students, but in between we traveled, performing and teaching nine-year-olds to MFA candidates, from California to Indiana to India to a public high school just up the street from campus.
And we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cracks open locks.
But it turns out sometimes, poetry can be really scary.
Turns out sometimes, you have to trick teenagers into writing poetry.
So I came up with lists. Everyone can write lists.
And the first list that I assign is "10 Things I Know to be True."
And here's what happens, and here's what you would discover too if we all started sharing our lists out loud.
At a certain point, you would realize that someone has the exact same thing, or one thing very similar, to something on your list.
And then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours.
Third, someone has something you've never even heard of before.
And fourth, someone has something you thought you knew everything about, but they're introducing a new angle of looking at it.
And I tell people that this is where great stories start from -- these four intersections of what you're passionate about and what others might be invested in.
And most people respond really well to this exercise.
But one of my students, a freshman named Charlotte, was not convinced.
Charlotte was very good at writing lists, but she refused to write any poems.
"Miss," she'd say, "I'm just not interesting.
I don't have anything interesting to say."
So I assigned her list after list, and one day I assigned the list "10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now."
Number three on Charlotte's list was, "I should have learned not to crush on guys three times my age."
I asked her what that meant, and she said, "Miss, it's kind of a long story."
And I said, "Charlotte, it sounds pretty interesting to me."
And so she wrote her first poem, a love poem unlike any I had ever heard before.
And the poem began, "Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man."
"Did you see him on 60 Minutes, racing Michael Phelps in a pool -- nothing but swim trunks on -- diving in the water, determined to beat this swimming champion?
After the race, he tossed his wet, cloud-white hair and said, 'You're a god.' No, Anderson, you're the god."
Now I know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem unfazed, to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you.
Somebody once told me it's like walking through life like this.
You protect yourself from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up.
But I try to walk through life like this.
And yes, that means catching all of those miseries and hurt, but it also means that when beautiful, amazing things just fall out of the sky, I'm ready to catch them.
I use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder, to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and, instead, actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them, so that they can reinterpret and create something from it.
It's not that I think that spoken word poetry is the ideal art form.
I'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story.
I write musicals; I make short films alongside my poems.
But I teach spoken word poetry because it's accessible.
Not everyone can read music or owns a camera, but everyone can communicate in some way, and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from.
Plus, spoken word poetry allows for immediate connections.
It's not uncommon for people to feel like they're alone or that nobody understands them, but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions, you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers, or your community, who will listen.
And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie will connect with what you've shared.
And that is an amazing realization to have, especially when you're 14.
Plus, now with YouTube, that connection's not even limited to the room we're in.
I'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances that I can share with my students.
It allows for even more opportunities for them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to.
It is tempting -- once you've figured this out -- it is tempting to keep writing the same poem, or keep telling the same story, over and over, once you've figured out that it will gain you applause.
It's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself.
You have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself.
And that is step three: infusing the work you're doing with the specific things that make you you, even while those things are always changing.
Because step three never ends.
But you don't get to start on step three, until you take step one first: I can.
I travel a lot while I'm teaching, and I don't always get to watch all of my students reach their step three, but I was very lucky with Charlotte, that I got to watch her journey unfold the way it did.
I watched her realize that, by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she's doing, she can create poems that only Charlotte can write -- about eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer.
And I'm trying to tell stories only I can tell -- like this story.
I spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story, and I wondered if the best way was going to be a PowerPoint or a short film -- and where exactly was the beginning or the middle or the end?
And I wondered whether I'd get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out, or not.
And I always thought that my beginning was at the Bowery Poetry Club, but it's possible that it was much earlier.
In preparing for TED, I discovered this diary page in an old journal.
I think December 54th was probably supposed to be 24th.
It's clear that when I was a child, I definitely walked through life like this.
I think that we all did.
I would like to help others rediscover that wonder -- to want to engage with it, to want to learn, to want to share what they've learned, what they've figured out to be true and what they're still figuring out.
So I'd like to close with this poem.
When they bombed Hiroshima, the explosion formed a mini-supernova so every living animal, human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash.
And what was left of the city soon followed.
The long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder.
When I was born, my mom says I looked around the whole hospital room with a stare that said, "This? I've done this before."
She says I have old eyes.
When my Grandpa Genji died, I was only five years old, but I took my mom by the hand and told her, "Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby."
And yet, for someone who's apparently done this already, I still haven't figured anything out yet.
My knees still buckle every time I get on a stage.
My self-confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry, and it still always tastes funny in my mouth.
But in Hiroshima, some people were wiped clean away, leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.
So no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets, I keep trying, hoping that one day I'll write a poem I can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof I existed.
My parents named me Sarah, which is a biblical name.
In the original story, God told Sarah she could do something impossible and she laughed, because the first Sarah, she didn't know what to do with impossible.
And me? Well, neither do I, but I see the impossible every day.
Impossible is trying to connect in this world, trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you, knowing that while you're speaking, they aren't just waiting for their turn to talk -- they hear you.
They feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it.
It's what I strive for every time I open my mouth -- that impossible connection.
There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima that was completely burnt black by the radiation.
But on the front step, a person who was sitting there blocked the rays from hitting the stone.
The only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light.
After the A-bomb, specialists said it would take 75 years for the radiation-damaged soil of Hiroshima City to ever grow anything again.
But that spring, there were new buds popping up from the earth.
When I meet you, in that moment, I'm no longer a part of your future.
I start quickly becoming part of your past.
But in that instant, I get to share your present.
And you, you get to share mine.
And that is the greatest present of all.
So if you tell me I can do the impossible, I'll probably laugh at you.
I don't know if I can change the world yet, because I don't know that much about it -- and I don't know that much about reincarnation either, but if you make me laugh hard enough, sometimes I forget what century I'm in.
This isn't my first time here. This isn't my last time here.
These aren't the last words I'll share.
But just in case, I'm trying my hardest to get it right this time around.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

<title>Sarah Kay: If I should have a daughter ...</title>
<description>"If I should have a daughter, instead of Mom, she's gonna call me Point B ... " began spoken word poet Sarah Kay, in a talk that inspired two standing ovations at TED2011. She tells the story of her metamorphosis -- from a wide-eyed teenager soaking in verse at New York's Bowery Poetry Club to a teacher connecting kids with the power of self-expression through Project V.O.I.C.E. -- and gives two breathtaking performances of "B" and "Hiroshima."</description>

This room may appear to be holding 600 people, but there's actually so many more, because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities.
I have two primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation within me since I was a little girl.
I call them "the mystic" and "the warrior."
I was born into a family of politically active, intellectual atheists.
There was this equation in my family that went something like this: if you are intelligent, you therefore are not spiritual.
I was the freak of the family.
I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses.
I wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality.
So, looking for answers, I went to Catholic mass.
I tagged along with my neighbors.
I read Sartre and Socrates.
And then a wonderful thing happened when I was in high school: Gurus from the East started washing up on the shores of America.
And I said to myself, "I wanna get me one of them."
And ever since, I've been walking the mystic path, trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called "the optical delusion of everyday consciousness."
So what did he mean by this? I'll show you.
Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room.
Now, see this strange, underwater, coral reef-looking thing?
It's actually a person's trachea, and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now, all around us.
If we're blind to this simple biology, imagine what we're missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels.
My years as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions.
They've made me a proud I-don't-know-it-all.
Now when the mystic part of me jabbers on and on like this, the warrior rolls her eyes.
She's concerned about what's happening in this world right now.
She's worried.
She says, "Excuse me, I'm pissed off, and I know a few things, and we better get busy about them right now."
I've spent my life as a warrior, working for women's issues, working on political campaigns, being an activist for the environment.
And it can be sort of crazy-making, housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body.
I've always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off, who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic -- people like Martin Luther King, Jr., who wrote, "I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be.
This," he wrote, "is the interrelated structure of reality."
Then Mother Teresa, another mystic warrior, who said, "The problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small."
And Nelson Mandela, who lives by the African concept of "ubuntu," which means "I need you in order to be me, and you need me in order to be you."
Now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with the saint gene.
But we all actually have the same capacity that they do, and we need to do their work now.
I'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing "the Other" by the voice we're giving to the most divisive among us.
Listen to these titles of some of the bestselling books from both sides of the political divide here in the U.S.
"Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder," "Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot," "Pinheads and Patriots," "Arguing With Idiots."
They're supposedly tongue-in-cheek, but they're actually dangerous.
Now here's a title that may sound familiar, but whose author may surprise you: "Four-and-a-Half-Years of Struggle Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice."
Who wrote that?
That was Adolf Hitler's first title for "Mein Kampf" -- "My Struggle" -- the book that launched the Nazi party.
The worst eras in human history, whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda, they start like this, with negative other-izing.
And then they morph into violent extremism.
This is why I'm launching a new initiative.
And it's to help all of us, myself included, to counteract the tendency to "otherize."
And I realize we're all busy people, so don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break.
I'm calling my initiative, "Take the Other to Lunch."
If you are a Republican, you can take a Democrat to lunch, or if you're a Democrat, think of it as taking a Republican to lunch.
Now if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite, I suggest you start more local, because there is no shortage of the Other right in your own neighborhood.
Maybe that person who worships at the mosque, or the church or the synagogue, down the street.
Or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict.
Or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn't believe in global warming.
Anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you, or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears.
A couple of weeks ago, I took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch.
Now on paper, she passed my smoking ears test.
She's an activist from the Right, and I'm an activist from the Left.
And we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated, and you can use them too, because I know you're all going to take an Other to lunch.
So first of all, decide on a goal: to get to know one person from a group you may have negatively stereotyped.
And then, before you get together, agree on some ground rules.
My Tea Party lunchmate and I came up with these: don't persuade, defend or interrupt.
Be curious; be conversational; be real.
And listen.
From there, we dove in.
And we used these questions: Share some of your life experiences with me.
What issues deeply concern you?
And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side?
My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights, and I'm going to share just one with you.
I think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere.
I asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side.
"What?" she wanted to know.
"Like we're a bunch of elitist, morally-corrupt terrorist-lovers."
Well, she was shocked.
She thought my side beat up on her side way more often, that we called them brainless, gun-toting racists, and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know.
And since we had established some trust, we believed in each other's sincerity.
We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of "otherizing" talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite.
By the end of our lunch, we acknowledged each other's openness.
Neither of us had tried to change the other.
But we also hadn't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch.
Instead, we had taken first steps together, past our knee-jerk reactions, to the ubuntu place, which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable-seeming problems will be found.
Who should you invite to lunch?
Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing, that will be your clue.
And what might happen at your lunch?
Will the heavens open and "We Are the World" play over the restaurant sound system?
Probably not.
Because ubuntu work is slow, and it's difficult.
It's two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls.
It's two people, two warriors, dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other.
Here's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it: "Out beyond ideas of wrong-doing and right-doing, there is a field.
I'll meet you there."

<description>There's an angry divisive tension in the air that threatens to make modern politics impossible. Elizabeth Lesser explores the two sides of human nature within us that can be harnessed to elevate the way we treat each other.

So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate; we have them work in government.
The program is called Code for America, and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.
We select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments.
Instead of sending them off into the Third World, we send them into the wilds of City Hall.
And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers.
But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today.
So meet Al.
Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date, but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in, because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires when he's covered in four feet of snow.
Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner?
We had a team of fellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program.
They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year.
And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants.
But one fellow in particular, a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober, noticed something else, and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things.
So he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app.
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.
If you do, you get to name it, and he called the first one Al.
And if you don't, someone can steal it from you.
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it.
This is a modest little app.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.
But it's doing something that no other government technology does.
It's spreading virally.
There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it, not for snow, but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.
It's very important that these tsunami sirens work, but people steal the batteries out of them.
So he's getting citizens to check on them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.
And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.
So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this.
And this has spread just frictionlessly, organically, naturally.
If you know anything about government technology, you know that this isn't how it normally goes.
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years.
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months.
It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids.
We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels, it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
There is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally, that's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government.
It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company, as many people think it should.
And not even like a tech company, but more like the Internet itself.
And that means permissionless, it means open, it means generative.
And that's important.
But what's more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an ossified institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's great news, because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action with digital technology.
Now there's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively.
It's not just Code for America fellows, there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up on government.
They are frustrated as hell with it, but they're not complaining about it, they're fixing it.
And these folks know something that we've lost sight of.
And that's that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DMV and all those other things that we're really mad about, government is, at its core, in the words of Tim O'Reilly, "What we do together that we can't do alone."
Now a lot of people have given up on government.
And if you're one of those people, I would ask that you reconsider, because things are changing.
Politics is not changing; government is changing.
And because government ultimately derives its power from us -- remember "We the people?" -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens.
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.
And like a lot of people, I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.
Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion that, especially local government, is about opossums.
This is the call center for the services and information line.
It's generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city.
If you should ever have the chance to staff your city's call center, as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program -- in fact, they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues, including having an opossum stuck in your house.
So Scott gets this call.
He types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base.
He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control.
And finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves?"
So that worked. So booya for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the opossums.
Boston doesn't just have a call center.
It has an app, a Web and mobile app, called Citizens Connect.
Now we didn't write this app.
This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in: "Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead.
How do I get this removed?"
But what happens with Citizens Connect is different.
So Scott was speaking person-to-person.
But on Citizens Connect everything is public, so everybody can see this.
And in this case, a neighbor saw it.
And the next report we got said, "I walked over to this location, found the trashcan behind the house.
Opossum? Check. Living? Yep.
Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home.
Goodnight sweet opossum."
Pretty simple.
So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical.
And it's also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here.
I'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others.
So one citizen helped another citizen, but government played a key role here.
It connected those two people.
And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed, but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services.
When one neighbor helps another, we strengthen our communities.
We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.
Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics.
And most people get that, but they think that one is the input to the other.
That our input to the system of government is voting.
Now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs, and then not that much changes?
That's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top.
And what's under that is what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word with such contempt.
But it's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that's working against us, this other thing, and then we're disempowering ourselves.
People seem to think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work for us, we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government happens.
We have to engage with the machinery of government.
So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done.
Have you seen these guys?
It's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 325-page report that's a response to the SEC's request for comment on the Financial Reform Bill.
That's not being politically active, that's being bureaucratically active.
Now for those of us who've given up on government, it's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they're going to face.
Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us?
We can't do without government, but we do need it to be more effective.
The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society.
And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet, and they know that it's not that hard to do things together, you just have to architect the systems the right way.
Now the average age of our fellows is 28, so I am, begrudgingly, almost a generation older than most of them.
This is a generation that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted.
They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting about who gets to speak; they all get to speak.
They can express their opinion on any channel at any time, and they do.
So when they're faced with the problem of government, they don't care as much about using their voices.
They're using their hands.
They're using their hands to write applications that make government work better.
And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better.
That could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed, turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it.
And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along, and many people do.
But these apps are like little digital reminders that we're not just consumers, and we're not just consumers of government, putting in our taxes and getting back services.
We're more than that, we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship.
So the question I have for all of you here: When it comes to the big, important things that we need to do together, all of us together, are we just going to be a crowd of voices, or are we also going to be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.

What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure, wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007.
The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this.
Every single bead, every single colored band, represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note.
I find weather extremely fascinating.
Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us.
So I use sculpture and music to make it, not just visible, but also tactile and audible.
All of my work begins very simple.
I extract information from a specific environment using very low-tech data collecting devices -- generally anything I can find in the hardware store.
I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet -- satellite images, weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys.
That's both historical as well as real data.
And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here.
These clipboards are filled with numbers.
And from all of these numbers, I start with only two or three variables.
That begins my translation process.
My translation medium is a very simple basket.
A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements.
When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements, I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form.
I use natural reed, because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that I cannot fully control.
That means that it is the numbers that control the form, not me.
What I come up with are forms like these.
These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data.
Every colored bead, every colored string, represents a weather element.
And together, these elements, not only construct the form, but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two-dimensional graph.
When you step closer, you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers.
The vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day.
So all the way around, you have a 24-hour timeline.
But it's also used to assign a temperature range.
On that grid, I can then weave the high tide readings, water temperature, air temperature and Moon phases.
I also translate weather data into musical scores.
And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it.
So all of these scores are made up of weather data.
Every single color, dot, every single line, is a weather element.
And together, these variables construct a score.
I use these scores to collaborate with musicians.
This is the 1913 Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum.
Meanwhile, I use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this, that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather visualization, but now they're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score, so it can actually be read as a musical score.
What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science.
This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it.
You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture.
You place it in a science museum, it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data.
You place it in a music hall, it all of a sudden becomes a musical score.
And I really like that, because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music.
The other reason why I really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science.
And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science.
So for me, that was my way into it.
Thank you.

Lauren Hodge: If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option, which would you choose, grilled or fried chicken?
Now most people would answer grilled, and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories.
However, grilled chicken poses a hidden danger.
The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines -- specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine, or PhIP -- which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound.
A carcinogen is any substance or agent that causes abnormal growth of cells, which can also cause them to metastasize or spread.
They are also organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia is replaced with a more complex group.
Studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines.
However, no studies exist yet that show how or why.
These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens.
And as you can see, none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe, which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet.
Now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea.
And I was led to it through a series of events.
I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office -- which was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine and seven different fast food restaurants.
They weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken, but they were sued because of California's Proposition 65, which stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning.
So I was very surprised about this.
And I was wondering why nobody knew more about this dangerous grilled chicken, which doesn't seem very harmful.
But then one night, my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner, and I noticed that the edges of the chicken, which had been marinated in lemon juice, turned white.
And later in biology class, I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing, which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function.
So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis, saying that, could possibly the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade and could it be due to the differences in PH?
So my idea was born, and I had the project set up and a hypothesis, so what was my next step?
Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at because I didn't have the equipment in my school.
I thought this would be easy, but I emailed about 200 different people within a five-hour radius of where I lived, and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me.
Most of the others either never responded back, said they didn't have the time or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me.
So it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times.
However, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab -- so I could finally start my project.
The first stage was completed at home, which consisted of marinating the chicken, grilling the chicken, amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab.
The second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab, which is where I extracted the chemicals, changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken.
The final stages, when I ran the samples through a high-pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer, which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had in my chicken.
So when I went through the data, I had very surprising results, because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation.
When compared with the unmarinated chicken, which is what I used as my control, I found that lemon juice worked by far the best, which decreased the carcinogens by about 98 percent.
The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well, decreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent.
Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation, but it was nearly negligible.
And the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range, but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens.
Another important factor that I didn't take into account initially was the time cooked.
And I found that if you increase the time cooked, the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases.
So the best way to marinate chicken, based on this, is to, not under-cook, but definitely don't over-cook and char the chicken, and marinate in either lemon juice, brown sugar or saltwater.
Based on these findings, I have a question for you.
Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life?
Now I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated, you're definitely going to catch cancer and die.
However, anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle.
Is it worth it to you?
How will you cook your chicken now?
Shree Bose: Hi everyone. I'm Shree Bose.
I was the 17-18 year-old age category winner and then the grand prize winner.
And I want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant.
And she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you that little kids will eat their vegetables if they're different colors.
Sounds ridiculous, right.
But that was me years ago.
And that was my first science fair project.
It got a bit more complicated from there.
My older brother Panaki Bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when I barely understood basic algebra.
My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects, including a remote controlled garbage can.
And then came the summer after my freshman year, when my grandfather passed away due to cancer.
And I remember watching my family go through that and thinking that I never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss.
So, armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology, I decided I wanted to do cancer research at 15.
Good plan.
So I started emailing all of these professors in my area asking to work under their supervision in a lab.
Got rejected by all except one.
And then went on, my next summer, to work under Dr. Basu at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth, Texas.
And that is where the research began.
So ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don't know about, or at least don't pay that much attention to.
But yet, it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States.
In fact, one in 70 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer.
One in 100 will die from it.
Chemotherapy, one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today, involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells.
Cisplatin is a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug -- a relatively simple molecule made in the lab that messes with the DNA of cancer cells and causes them to kill themselves.
Sounds great, right?
But here's the problem: sometimes patients become resistant to the drug, and then years after they've been declared to be cancer free, they come back.
And this time, they no longer respond to the drug.
It's a huge problem.
In fact, it's one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today.
So we wanted to figure out how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant to this drug called Cisplatin.
And we wanted to figure this out, because if we could figure that out, then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening.
So that's what we set out to do.
And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase, an energy protein.
So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein, and we saw this huge shift.
I mean, on the slide, you can see that on our sensitive side, these cells that are responding to the drug, when we start blocking the protein, the number of dying cells -- those colored dots -- But then on this side, with the same treatment, they're going up -- interesting.
But those are dots on a screen for you; what exactly does that mean?
Well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell.
And in fact, it might be changing the cells themselves to make the cells resistant.
And that's huge.
In fact, it means that if a patient comes in and they're resistant to this drug, then if we give them a chemical to block this protein, then we can treat them again with the same drug.
And that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness -- possibly for many different types of cancer.
So that was my work, and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research, with figuring out exactly what this protein does, but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness -- so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren.
But my work wasn't just about the research.
It was about finding my passion.
That's why being the grand prize winner of the Google Global Science Fair -- cute picture, right -- it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor.
And ever since then, I've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff -- from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys.
But like I said, my journey wasn't just about the research, it was about finding my passion, and it was about making my own opportunities when I didn't even know what I was doing.
It was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing.
After all, my story begins with a dried, withered spinach plant and it's only getting better from there.
Thank you.
Naomi Shah: Hi everyone. I'm Naomi Shah, and today I'll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients.
1.6 million deaths worldwide.
One death every 20 seconds.
People spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors.
And the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined.
Now these statistics had a huge impact on me, but what really sparked my interest in my research was watching both my dad and my brother suffer from chronic allergies year-round.
It confused me; why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season?
With this question in mind, I started researching, and I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit.
As soon as I realized this, I investigated the underlying relationship between four prevalent air pollutants and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients.
At first, I just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients.
But soon after, I developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients.
And it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health, because that relationship seems so important.
So with that in mind, I started researching more, I started investigating more, and I became very passionate.
Because I realized that if we could find a way to target remediation, we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively.
For example, volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools, homes and workplaces.
They're everywhere.
These chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant, as defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act.
Which is surprising to me, because these chemical pollutants, through my research, I show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated.
So today I want to show you my interactive software model that I created.
I'm going to show it to you on my laptop.
And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today, Julie.
And all of Julie's data has been pre-entered into my interactive software model.
And this can be used by anyone.
So I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes, or someone who's really close to you who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder.
So Julie's going to her doctor's office to get treated for her asthma.
And the doctor has her sit down, and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate -- which is essentially her exhalation rate, or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath.
So that peak expiratory flow rate, I've entered it up into the interactive software model.
I've also entered in her age, her gender and her height.
I've assumed that she lives in an average household with average air pollutant levels.
So any user can come in here and click on "lung function report" and it'll take them to this report that I created.
And this report really drives home the crux of my research.
So what it shows -- if you want to focus on that top graph in the right-hand corner -- it shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar.
This is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office.
In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph, it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate, what her exhalation rate or lung health, should be based on her age, gender and height.
So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar, and he says, "Wow, we need to give her steroids, medication and inhalers."
But I want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids, inhalers and medication, the doctor turns to Julie and says, "Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters.
Clean out the air ducts in your home, in your workplace, in your school.
Stop the use of incense and candles.
And if you're remodeling your house, take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring."
Because these solutions are natural, these solutions are sustainable, and these solutions are long-term investments -- long-term investments that we're making for our generation and for future generations.
Because these environmental solutions that Julie can make in her home, her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her.
So I'm very passionate about this research and I really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma, more respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants.
But before I end my talk today, I want to leave you with one saying.
And that saying is that genetics loads the gun, but the environment pulls the trigger.
And that made a huge impact on me when I was doing this research.
Because what I feel, is a lot of us think that the environment is at a macro level, that we can't do anything to change our air quality or to change the climate or anything.
But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home, in our own school and in our own workplace, we can make a huge difference in air quality.
Because remember, we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors.
And air quality and air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients, anyone with a respiratory disorder and really all of us in general.
So I want you to reimagine a world with better air quality, better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations.
Thank you.
Lisa Ling: Right.

<title>Lauren Hodge, Shree Bose + Naomi Shah: Award-winning teenage science in action</title>

I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids, ages six to eight, at a children's museum, and I brought with me a bag full of legs, similar to the kinds of things you see up here, and had them laid out on a table for the kids.
And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious about what they don't know, or don't understand, or is foreign to them.
They only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way, and maybe censors that natural curiosity, or you know, reins in the question-asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids.
So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids, saying, "Now, whatever you do, don't stare at her legs."
But, of course, that's the point.
That's why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.
So I made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own.
The doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs, and they are poking and prodding, and they're wiggling toes, and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that.
And I said, "Kids, really quickly -- I woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house -- nothing too big, two or three stories -- but, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character, anything you can dream up right now, what kind of legs would you build me?"
And immediately a voice shouted, "Kangaroo!"
"No, no, no! Should be a frog!"
"No. It should be Go Go Gadget!"
"No, no, no! It should be the Incredibles."
And other things that I don't -- aren't familiar with.
And then, one eight-year-old said, "Hey, why wouldn't you want to fly too?"
And the whole room, including me, was like, "Yeah."
And just like that, I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as "disabled" to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet.
Somebody that might even be super-abled.
Interesting.
So some of you actually saw me at TED, 11 years ago.
And there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception.
TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.
At the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.
I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah, which you may have seen on stage yesterday.
And also these very life-like, intrinsically painted silicone legs.
So at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs.
So that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function and aesthetic, and assigning them different values.
Well, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call.
And the journey started, funny enough, with a TED conference attendee -- Chee Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today.
She was the editor then of a magazine called ID, and she gave me a cover story.
This started an incredible journey.
Curious encounters were happening to me at the time; I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world.
And people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk, men and women.
And the conversation would go something like this, "You know Aimee, you're very attractive.
You don't look disabled."
I thought, "Well, that's amazing, because I don't feel disabled."
And it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored, about beauty.
What does a beautiful woman have to look like?
What is a sexy body?
And interestingly, from an identity standpoint, what does it mean to have a disability?
I mean, people -- Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.
Nobody calls her disabled.
So this magazine, through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville, went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen, and photographer Nick Knight, who were also interested in exploring that conversation.
So, three months after TED I found myself on a plane to London, doing my first fashion shoot, which resulted in this cover -- "Fashion-able"?
Three months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash.
Nobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots.
Actually, I have them on stage with me: grapevines, magnolias -- truly stunning.
Poetry matters.
Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art.
It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look, and look a little longer, and maybe even understand.
I learned this firsthand with my next adventure.
The artist Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the "The Cremaster Cycle."
This is where it really hit home for me -- that my legs could be wearable sculpture.
And even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness as the only aesthetic ideal.
So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane, a.k.a. bowling ball material.
Heavy!
Then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a potato root system growing in them, and beetroots out the top, and a very lovely brass toe.
That's a good close-up of that one.
Then another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah -- a little homage to my life as an athlete.
14 hours of prosthetic make-up to get into a creature that had articulated paws, claws and a tail that whipped around, like a gecko.
And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these -- look like jellyfish legs, also polyurethane.
And the only purpose that these legs can serve, outside the context of the film, is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.
So whimsy matters.
Today, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me, and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet, and I can change my height -- I have a variable of five different heights.
Today, I'm 6'1".
And I had these legs made a little over a year ago at Dorset Orthopedic in England and when I brought them home to Manhattan, my first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.
And a girl was there who has known me for years at my normal 5'8".
Her mouth dropped open when she saw me, and she went, "But you're so tall!"
And I said, "I know. Isn't it fun?"
I mean, it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts, but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams that I never expected I would ever have.
And I was having fun with it.
And she looked at me, and she said, "But, Aimee, that's not fair."
And the incredible thing was she really meant it.
It's not fair that you can change your height, as you want it.
And that's when I knew -- that's when I knew that the conversation with society has changed profoundly in this last decade.
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.
It's a conversation about augmentation.
It's a conversation about potential.
A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space.
So people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment.
And what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting-edge technology -- robotics, bionics -- with the age-old poetry, we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.
I think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity, we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have.
I think of Shakespeare's Shylock: "If you prick us, do we not bleed, and if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"
It is our humanity, and all the potential within it, that makes us beautiful.
Thank you.

The night before I was heading for Scotland, I was invited to host the final of "China's Got Talent" show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium.
Guess who was the performing guest?
Susan Boyle.
And I told her, "I'm going to Scotland the next day."
She sang beautifully, and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese: 送你葱 So it's not like "hello" or "thank you," that ordinary stuff.
It means "green onion for free."
Why did she say that?
Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle -- a 50-some year-old woman, a vegetable vendor in Shanghai, who loves singing Western opera, but she didn't understand any English or French or Italian, so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese.
And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was "green onion for free."
So [as] Susan Boyle was saying that, 80,000 live audience sang together.
That was hilarious.
So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness.
They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment, yet their courage and talent brought them through.
And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams.
Well, being different is not that difficult.
We are all different from different perspectives.
But I think being different is good, because you present a different point of view.
You may have the chance to make a difference.
My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20, 30 years.
I remember that in the year of 1990, when I was graduating from college, I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in Beijing, Great Wall Sheraton -- it's still there.
So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour, he finally said, "So, Miss Yang, do you have any questions to ask me?"
I summoned my courage and poise and said, "Yes, but could you let me know, what actually do you sell?"
I didn't have a clue what a sales department was about in a five-star hotel.
That was the first day I set my foot in a five-star hotel.
Around the same time, I was going through an audition -- the first ever open audition by national television in China -- with another thousand college girls.
The producer told us they were looking for some sweet, innocent and beautiful fresh face.
So when it was my turn, I stood up and said, "Why [do] women's personalities on television always have to be beautiful, sweet, innocent and, you know, supportive?
Why can't they have their own ideas and their own voice?"
I thought I kind of offended them.
But actually, they were impressed by my words.
And so I was in the second round of competition, and then the third and the fourth.
After seven rounds of competition, I was the last one to survive it.
So I was on a national television prime-time show.
And believe it or not, that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script.
And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people.
Well after a few years, I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies, and then started my own media company, which was unthought of during the years that I started my career.
So we do a lot of things.
I've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past.
And sometimes I have young people approaching me say, "Lan, you changed my life," and I feel proud of that.
But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country.
I was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games.
I was representing the Shanghai Expo.
I saw China embracing the world and vice versa.
But then sometimes I'm thinking, what are today's young generation up to?
How are they different, and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China, or at large, the world?
So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media.
First of all, who are they? [What] do they look like?
Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei -- 20 years old, beautiful.
She showed off her expensive bags, clothes and car on her microblog, which is the Chinese version of Twitter.
And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce.
She didn't realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning, almost a turmoil, against the credibility of Red Cross.
The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it, and the investigation is going on.
So far, as of today, we know that she herself made up that title -- probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity.
All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend, who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce.
It's very complicated to explain.
But anyway, the public still doesn't buy it.
It is still boiling.
It shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions, which lacked transparency in the past.
And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog.
Microblog boomed in the year of 2010, with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled.
Sina.com, a major news portal, alone has more than 140 million microbloggers.
On Tencent, 200 million.
The most popular blogger -- it's not me -- it's a movie star, and she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans.
About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people, under 30 years old.
And because, as you know, the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government, social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit.
But because you don't have many other openings, the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong, active and even violent.
So through microblogging, we are able to understand Chinese youth even better.
So how are they different?
First of all, most of them were born in the 80s and 90s, under the one-child policy.
And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls, now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women.
That could pose a potential danger to the society, but who knows; we're in a globalized world, so they can look for girlfriends from other countries.
Most of them have fairly good education.
The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent.
In cities, 80 percent of kids go to college.
But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with seven-point-some percent this year, and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030.
And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially, and taking care of them when they're sick.
So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old.
So making a living is not that easy for young people.
College graduates are not in short supply.
In urban areas, college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month, while the average rent is above $500.
So what do they do? They have to share space -- squeezed in very limited space to save money -- and they call themselves "tribe of ants."
And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment, they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment.
That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn, but in China it's 30 to 40 years with the skyrocketing real estate price.
Among the 200 million migrant workers, 60 percent of them are young people.
They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas.
Most of them don't want to go back to the countryside, but they don't have the sense of belonging.
They work for longer hours with less income, less social welfare.
And they're more vulnerable to job losses, subject to inflation, tightening loans from banks, appreciation of the renminbi, or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce.
Last year, though, an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China: 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide, just one by one like causing a contagious disease.
But they died because of all different personal reasons.
But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation, both physical and mental, of these migrant workers.
For those who do return back to the countryside, they find themselves very welcome locally, because with the knowledge, skills and networks they have learned in the cities, with the assistance of the Internet, they're able to create more jobs, upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market.
So for the past few years, the coastal areas, they found themselves in a shortage of labor.
These diagrams show a more general social background.
The first one is the Engels coefficient, which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade, in terms of family income, to about 37-some percent.
But then in the last two years, it goes up again to 39 percent, indicating a rising living cost.
The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4.
Now it's 0.5 -- even worse than that in America -- showing us the income inequality.
And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility.
And also, the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread.
So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest.
So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging, we can see what young people care most about.
Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand.
For the past decade or so, a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property.
And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation.
Sometimes people get killed, and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest.
So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet, people cry for the government to take actions to stop this.
So the good news is that earlier this year, the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court.
Similarly, many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet.
We heard about polluted air, polluted water, poisoned food.
And guess what, we have faked beef.
They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish, and it turns it to look like beef.
And then lately, people are very concerned about cooking oil, because thousands of people have been found [refining] cooking oil from restaurant slop.
So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet.
And fortunately, we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns.
While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making, but sometimes they're a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life.
China is soon to pass the U.S.
as the number one market for luxury brands -- that's not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere.
But you know what, half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars.
They're not rich at all.
They're taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status.
And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle.
But of course, we do have young people who would still prefer to smile, whether in a BMW or [on] a bicycle.
So in the next picture, you see a very popular phenomenon called "naked" wedding, or "naked" marriage.
It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding, but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house, without a car, without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet, to show their commitment to true love.
And also, people are doing good through social media.
And the first picture showed us that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging.
People were donating money, dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck.
And after hours of negotiation, 500 dogs were rescued.
And here also people are helping to find missing children.
A father posted his son's picture onto the Internet.
After thousands of resends in relay, the child was found, and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging.
So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years.
Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values, but also, it's about the environment.
People are thinking about the following questions: Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP?
How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth, to keep sustainability and stability?
And also, how capable is the system of self-correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time?
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer.
And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves.
Thank you very much.

<keywords>china,economics,global issues,media,politics</keywords>

I'm a very lucky person.
I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth and the people and creatures that live on it.
And my passion was inspired at the age of seven, when my parents first took me to Morocco, at the edge of the Sahara Desert.
Now imagine a little Brit somewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home.
What an amazing experience.
And it made me want to explore more.
So as a filmmaker, I've been from one end of the Earth to the other trying to get the perfect shot and to capture animal behavior never seen before.
And what's more, I'm really lucky, because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide.
Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step.
You might think that it's quite hard to find new stories and new subjects, but new technology is changing the way we can film.
It's enabling us to get fresh, new images and tell brand new stories.
In Nature's Great Events, a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough, we wanted to do just that.
Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar.
You see them all the time, you think.
But there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see and had never been filmed.
So what we did, we went to Alaska, which is where the grizzlies rely on really high, almost inaccessible, mountain slopes for their denning.
And the only way to film that is a shoot from the air.
David Attenborough: Throughout Alaska and British Columbia, thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep.
There is nothing to eat up here, but the conditions were ideal for hibernation.
Lots of snow in which to dig a den.
To find food, mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast, where the snow will already be melting.
But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs.
These mountains are dangerous places, but ultimately the fate of these bear families, and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific, depends on the salmon.
KB: I love that shot.
I always get goosebumps every time I see it.
That was filmed from a helicopter using a gyro-stabilized camera.
And it's a wonderful bit of gear, because it's like having a flying tripod, crane and dolly all rolled into one.
But technology alone isn't enough.
To really get the money shots, it's down to being in the right place at the right time.
And that sequence was especially difficult.
The first year we got nothing.
We had to go back the following year, all the way back to the remote parts of Alaska.
And we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks.
And eventually we got lucky.
The cloud lifted, the wind was still, and even the bear showed up.
And we managed to get that magic moment.
For a filmmaker, new technology is an amazing tool, but the other thing that really, really excites me is when new species are discovered.
Now, when I heard about one animal, I knew we had to get it for my next series, Untamed Americas, for National Geographic.
In 2005, a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of Ecuador.
And what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower.
It depends solely on the bat.
Now, the series hasn't even aired yet, so you're the very first to see this.
See what you think.
The tube-lipped nectar bat.
A pool of delicious nectar lies at the bottom of each flower's long flute.
But how to reach it?
Necessity is the mother of evolution.
This two-and-a-half-inch bat has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue, the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world.
If human, he'd have a nine-foot tongue.
KB: What a tongue.
We filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower and using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times.
So imagine how quick that thing is in real life.
Now people often ask me, "Where's your favorite place on the planet?"
And the truth is I just don't have one.
There are so many wonderful places.
But some locations draw you back time and time again.
And one remote location -- I first went there as a backpacker; I've been back several times for filming, most recently for Untamed Americas -- it's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America, and it's the most otherworldly place I know.
But at 15,000 feet, it's tough.
It's freezing cold, and that thin air really gets you.
Sometimes it's hard to breathe, especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment.
And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover.
But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity.
Have a look.
Some 1,500 miles south of the tropics, between Chile and Bolivia, the Andes completely change.
It's called the Altiplano, or "high plains" -- a place of extremes and extreme contrasts.
Where deserts freeze and waters boil.
More like Mars than Earth, it seems just as hostile to life.
The stars themselves -- at 12,000 feet, the dry, thin air makes for perfect stargazing.
Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby.
But just looking up with the naked eye, you really don't need one.
KB: Thank you so much for letting me share some images of our magnificent, wonderful Earth.
Thank you for letting me share that with you.

<title>Karen Bass: Unseen footage, untamed nature</title>
<description>At TED2012, filmmaker Karen Bass shares some of the astonishing nature footage she's shot for the BBC and National Geographic -- including brand-new, previously unseen footage of the tube-lipped nectar bat, who feeds in a rather unusual way …</description>

Okay, now I don't want to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar.
Also, the person to your left is a liar.
Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar.
We're all liars.
What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research says about why we're all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building.
Now speaking of trust, ever since I wrote this book, "Liespotting," no one wants to meet me in person anymore, no, no, no, no, no.
They say, "It's okay, we'll email you."
I can't even get a coffee date at Starbucks.
My husband's like, "Honey, deception?
Maybe you could have focused on cooking. How about French cooking?"
So before I get started, what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha.
Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha!
Your eyebrow twitched. You flared your nostril.
I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.' I know you're lying."
No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception.
They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature leaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations with difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times.
And they start up that path by accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act.
Think about it, a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance.
Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie.
So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to.
Truth number one about lying: Lying's a cooperative act.
Now not all lies are harmful.
Sometimes we're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret, secret.
We say, "Nice song."
"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no."
Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, "You know, I just fished that email out of my spam folder.
So sorry."
But there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception.
And that can have dramatic costs for us.
Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the United States.
That's an eyelash under a trillion dollars.
That's seven percent of revenues.
Deception can cost billions.
Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis.
Or in the case of double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security, they can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths of those that defend us.
Deception is actually serious business.
This con man, Henry Oberlander, he was such an effective con man British authorities say he could have undermined the entire banking system of the Western world.
And you can't find this guy on Google; you can't find him anywhere.
He was interviewed once, and he said the following.
He said, "Look, I've got one rule."
And this was Henry's rule, he said, "Look, everyone is willing to give you something.
They're ready to give you something for whatever it is they're hungry for."
And that's the crux of it.
If you don't want to be deceived, you have to know, what is it that you're hungry for?
And we all kind of hate to admit it.
We wish we were better husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on.
Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were, how we wish we could be, with what we're really like.
And boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies.
On a given day, studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Now granted, many of those are white lies.
But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Now when we first hear this data, we recoil.
We can't believe how prevalent lying is.
We're essentially against lying.
But if you look more closely, the plot actually thickens.
We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers.
Extroverts lie more than introverts.
Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people.
Women lie more to protect other people.
If you're an average married couple, you're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every 10 interactions.
Now you may think that's bad.
It you're unmarried, that number drops to three.
Lying's complex.
It's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives.
We're deeply ambivalent about the truth.
We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives.
That's truth number two about lying.
We're against lying, but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries.
It's as old as breathing.
It's part of our culture, it's part of our history.
Think Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, News of the World.
Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species.
Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive.
Now you might remember Koko.
Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language?
Koko was taught to communicate via sign language.
Here's Koko with her kitten.
It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten.
Koko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall.
We're hardwired to become leaders of the pack.
It's starts really, really early.
How early?
Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying.
One-year-olds learn concealment.
Two-year-olds bluff.
Five-year-olds lie outright.
They manipulate via flattery.
Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover up.
By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions.
By the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered with spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls a post-truth society.
It's been very confusing for a long time now.
What do you do?
Well there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass.
Trained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time.
The rest of us, we're only 54 percent accurate.
Why is it so easy to learn?
There are good liars and there are bad liars. There are no real original liars.
We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you two patterns of deception.
And then we're going to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves.
We're going to start with speech.
Bill Clinton: I want you to listen to me.
I'm going to say this again.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.
I never told anybody to lie, not a single time, never.
And these allegations are false.
And I need to go back to work for the American people.
Thank you.
Pamela Meyer: Okay, what were the telltale signs?
Well first we heard what's known as a non-contracted denial.
Studies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather than informal language.
We also heard distancing language: "that woman."
We know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves from their subject using language as their tool.
Now if Bill Clinton had said, "Well, to tell you the truth ... " or Richard Nixon's favorite, "In all candor ... " he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter than knows that qualifying language, as it's called, qualifying language like that, further discredits the subject.
Now if he had repeated the question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail -- and we're all really glad he didn't do that -- he would have further discredited himself.
Freud had it right.
Freud said, look, there's much more to it than speech: "No mortal can keep a secret.
If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips."
And we all do it no matter how powerful you are.
We all chatter with our fingertips.
I'm going to show you Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips.
Now this brings us to our next pattern, which is body language.
With body language, here's what you've got to do.
You've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door.
Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit.
Because we think liars fidget all the time.
Well guess what, they're known to freeze their upper bodies when they're lying.
We think liars won't look you in the eyes.
Well guess what, they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth.
We think warmth and smiles convey honesty, sincerity.
But a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away.
Can you all spot the fake smile here?
You can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks.
But the real smile's in the eyes, the crow's feet of the eyes.
They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox.
Don't overdo the Botox; nobody will think you're honest.
Now we're going to look at the hot spots.
Can you tell what's happening in a conversation?
Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words and someone's actions?
Now I know it seems really obvious, but when you're having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators.
An honest person is going to be cooperative.
They're going to show they're on your side.
They're going to be enthusiastic.
They're going to be willing and helpful to getting you to the truth.
They're going to be willing to brainstorm, name suspects, provide details.
They're going to say, "Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks."
They're going to be infuriated if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course of the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview.
And if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather than lenient punishment.
Now let's say you're having that exact same conversation with someone deceptive.
That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky.
Ask a deceptive person to tell their story, they're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places.
And then they're going to tell their story in strict chronological order.
And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways over the course of several hours, they will ask that person to tell that story backwards, and then they'll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive tells.
Why do they do that? Well we all do the same thing.
We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures.
We say "yes," we shake our heads "no."
We tell very convincing stories, we slightly shrug our shoulders.
We commit terrible crimes, and we smile at the delight in getting away with it.
Now that smile is known in the trade as "duping delight."
And we're going to see that in several videos moving forward, but we're going to start -- for those of you who don't know him, this is presidential candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering a child out of wedlock.
We're going to see him talk about getting a paternity test.
See now if you can spot him saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no," slightly shrugging his shoulders.
John Edwards: I'd be happy to participate in one.
I know that it's not possible that this child could be mine, because of the timing of events.
So I know it's not possible.
Happy to take a paternity test, and would love to see it happen.
Interviewer: Are you going to do that soon? Is there somebody -- JE: Well, I'm only one side. I'm only one side of the test.
But I'm happy to participate in one.
PM: Okay, those head shakes are much easier to spot once you know to look for them.
There're going to be times when someone makes one expression while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash.
Murderers are known to leak sadness.
Your new joint venture partner might shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger.
And we're not all going to become facial expression experts overnight here, but there's one I can teach you that's very dangerous, and it's easy to learn, and that's the expression of contempt.
Now with anger, you've got two people on an even playing field.
It's still somewhat of a healthy relationship.
But when anger turns to contempt, you've been dismissed.
It's associated with moral superiority.
And for that reason, it's very, very hard to recover from.
Here's what it looks like.
It's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in.
It's the only asymmetrical expression.
And in the presence of contempt, whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way, go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up for just one more nightcap. Thank you."
Science has surfaced many, many more indicators.
We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit.
They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them.
They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower.
Now here's the deal.
These behaviors are just behaviors.
They're not proof of deception.
They're red flags.
We're human beings.
We make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long.
They don't mean anything in and of themselves.
But when you see clusters of them, that's your signal.
Look, listen, probe, ask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode, ask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person you're talking to with rapport.
Don't try to be like those folks on "Law &amp; Order" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects into submission.
Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work.
Now we've talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie.
And as I promised, we're now going to look at what the truth looks like.
But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying, one is telling the truth.
And these were surfaced by researcher David Matsumoto in California.
And I think they're an excellent example of what the truth looks like.
This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it.
And you'll see when you see the video, she can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother.
What you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes and her very, very cool demeanor.
And if you look closely, you'll see duping delight throughout this video.
Diane Downs: At night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while I'm driving, and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth.
And that -- maybe it'll fade too with time -- but I don't think so.
That bothers me the most.
PM: Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother, Erin Runnion, confronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court.
Here you're going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression of a mother's agony.
Erin Runnion: I wrote this statement on the third anniversary of the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped.
And she fought, and I know she fought you.
But I know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her.
And I don't understand it, and I never will.
PM: Okay, there's no doubting the veracity of those emotions.
Now the technology around what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it.
We know for example that we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans, MRI's that can decode the signals that our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive.
And these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove incredibly useful some day.
But you've got to ask yourself in the meantime: Who do you want on your side of the meeting, someone who's trained in getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag a 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door?
Liespotters rely on human tools.
They know, as someone once said, "Character's who you are in the dark."
And what's kind of interesting is that today we have so little darkness.
Our world is lit up 24 hours a day.
It's transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public.
It's a much more noisy world.
So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, that's not honesty.
Our manic tweeting and texting can blind us to the fact that the subtleties of human decency -- character integrity -- that's still what matters, that's always what's going to matter.
So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code.
When you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie.
You start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, "Hey, my world, our world, it's going to be an honest one.
My world is going to be one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized and marginalized."
And when you do that, the ground around you starts to shift just a little bit.
And that's the truth. Thank you.

<title>Pamela Meyer: How to spot a liar</title>
<description>On any given day we're lied to from 10 to 200 times, and the clues to detect those lie can be subtle and counter-intuitive. Pamela Meyer, author of &lt;em&gt;Liespotting,&lt;/em&gt; shows the manners and "hotspots" used by those trained to recognize deception -- and she argues honesty is a value worth preserving.</description>
<keywords>culture,psychology,science,society</keywords>

One of my favorite parts of my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world, And when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places, I'm really struck by the things that we have in common.
They want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful, to be healthy, and to have a successful life.
But I also see lots of poverty, and it's quite jarring, both in the scale and the scope of it.
My first trip in India, I was in a person's home where they had dirt floors, no running water, no electricity, and that's really what I see all over the world.
So in short, I'm startled by all the things that they don't have.
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have: Coca-Cola.
Coke is everywhere.
In fact, when I travel to the developing world, Coke feels ubiquitous.
And so when I come back from these trips, and I'm thinking about development, and I'm flying home and I'm thinking, "We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations," you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder: how is it that they can get Coke to these far-flung places?
If they can do that, why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?
And I'm not the first person to ask this question.
But I think, as a community, we still have a lot to learn.
It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.
They sell 1.5 billion servings every single day.
That's like every man, woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week.
So why does this matter?
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world, we need to learn from the innovators, and those innovators come from every single sector.
I feel that, if we can understand what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous, we can apply those lessons then for the public good.
Coke's success is relevant, because if we can analyze it, learn from it, then we can save lives.
So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.
And I think there are really three things we can take away from Coca-Cola.
They take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product.
They tap into local entrepreneurial talent, and they do incredible marketing.
So let's start with the data.
Now Coke has a very clear bottom line -- they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.
So they take the data, and they use it to measure progress.
They have this very continuous feedback loop.
They learn something, they put it back into the product, they put it back into the market.
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."
It's a lot like other consumer companies.
So if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola, and you have a 107 constituencies, you know where every can versus bottle of Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold, whether it was a corner store, a supermarket or a pushcart.
So if sales start to drop, then the person can identify the problem and address the issue.
Let's contrast that for a minute to development.
In development, the evaluation comes at the very end of the project.
I've sat in a lot of those meetings, and by then, it is way too late to use the data.
I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark.
They said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.
It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on, and then you an see your impact."
Real-time data turns on the lights.
So what's the second thing that Coke's good at?
They're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent.
Coke's been in Africa since 1928, but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets, because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world, which was a large truck rolling down the street.
And in Africa, the remote places, it's hard to find a good road.
But Coke noticed something -- they noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that.
And they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs, giving them small loans.
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers, and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people, who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product.
There are now some 3,000 of these centers employing about 15,000 people in Africa.
In Tanzania and Uganda, they represent 90 percent of Coke's sales.
Let's look at the development side.
What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke?
Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well, because the locals know how to reach the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors, and they know what motivates them to make change.
I think a great example of this is Ethiopia's new health extension program.
The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic, they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.
So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby -- forget it, to get to the health care center.
They decided that wasn't good enough, so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala that also had a system like this, and they adapted it for Ethiopia.
And in 2003, the government of Ethiopia started this new system in their own country.
They trained 35,000 health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people.
In just five years, their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people.
Now, think about how this can change people's lives.
Health extension workers can help with so many things, whether it's family planning, prenatal care, immunizations for the children, or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on-time delivery.
That is having real impact in a country like Ethiopia, and it's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down 25 percent from 2000 to 2008.
In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program.
So what's the next step for Ethiopia?
Well, they're already starting talk about this.
They're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas?
How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting out in those remote villages?"
That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people's potential.
The third component of Coke's success is marketing.
Ultimately, Coke's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a Coca-Cola.
Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.
So, they rely on Coca-Cola in terms of its marketing, and what's the secret to their marketing?
Well, it's aspirational.
It is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live.
So even though it's a global company, they take a very local approach.
Coke's global campaign slogan is "Open Happiness."
But they localize it.
And they don't just guess what makes people happy; they go to places like Latin America and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life.
And in South Africa, they associate happiness with seriti or community respect.
Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it, "Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.
K'Naan: Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh Give you freedom, give you fire Give you reason, take you higher See the champions take the field now You define us, make us feel proud In the streets our heads are lifted As we lose our inhibition Celebration, it's around us Every nation, all around us Melinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right?
Well, they didn't stop there -- they localized it into 18 different languages.
And it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries.
It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood, "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing," that also went number one on the pop charts.
Both songs have something in common: that same appeal of celebration and unity.
So how does health and development market?
Well, it's based on avoidance, not aspirations.
I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.
"Use a condom, don't get AIDS."
"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea."
It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me.
And I think we make a fundamental mistake -- we make an assumption, that we think that, if people need something, we don't have to make them want that.
And I think that's a mistake.
And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.
One example is sanitation.
We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation.
But there's a solution: you build a toilet.
But what we're finding around the world, over and over again, is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there, it doesn't get used.
People reuse it for a slab for their home.
They sometimes store grain in it.
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop.
But what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?
Well, you work with the community.
You start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn't be done in the village, and they agree to that.
But then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern, trendy convenience.
One state in Northern India has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship.
And it works -- look at these headlines.
I'm not kidding.
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets.
No loo, no "I do."
Now, it's not just a funny headline -- it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign.
But more importantly, it saves lives.
Take a look at this -- this is a room full of young men and my husband, Bill.
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for?
They're waiting to be circumcised.
Can you you believe that?
We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection by 60 percent in men.
And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation, I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?"
But it turns out the men do, because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it, and the men also believe it improves their sex life.
So if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development, we can change communities and we can change whole nations.
Well, why is all of this so important?
So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together, when you tie the three things together.
And polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.
We've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.
So if you look back to 1988, there are about 350,000 cases of polio on the planet that year.
In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.
Well how did that happen?
Let's look at a country like India.
They have over a billion people in this country, but they have 35,000 local doctors who report paralysis, and clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.
They have two and a half million vaccinators.
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.
Let me tell you the story of Shriram, an 18 month boy in Bihar, a northern state in India.
This year on August 8th, he felt paralysis and on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.
On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample, and by the 25th of August, it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.
By August 30th, a genetic test was done, and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.
Now it could have come from one of two places.
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border, or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.
Luckily, the genetic testing proved that, in fact, this strand came north, because, had it come from the south, it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.
So many more people would have been affected.
So what's the endgame?
Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign, which is what you do in polio.
They went out and where Shriram lives, they vaccinated two million people.
So in less than a month, we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program.
And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.
That's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading, and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands; they can save lives.
Now one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing, but it might not be what you think.
It's not the marketing on the ground.
It's not telling the parents, "If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated."
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community.
The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last 20 years, but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer.
So by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.
So we are 99 percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money.
And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational, if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease, we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us.
And if we could do that, we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide, in all of our countries for polio.
And it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet.
And we are so close.
And this victory is so possible.
So if Coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness, I'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms.
To me, that is deep happiness.
And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector, then in the future we make together, that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as Coca-Cola.
Thank you.

<title>Melinda French Gates: What nonprofits can learn from Coca-Cola</title>
<description>In her talk, Melinda Gates makes a provocative case for nonprofits taking a cue from corporations such as Coca-Cola, whose plugged-in, global network of marketers and distributors ensures that every remote village wants -- and can get -- a Coke. Why shouldn't this work for condoms, sanitation, vaccinations too? &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

There have been many revolutions over the last century, but perhaps none as significant as the longevity revolution.
We are living on average today 34 years longer than our great-grandparents did.
Think about that.
That's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan.
And yet, for the most part, our culture has not come to terms with what this means.
We're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch.
That's the metaphor, the old metaphor.
You're born, you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude.
Age as pathology.
But many people today -- philosophers, artists, doctors, scientists -- are taking a new look at what I call the third act, the last three decades of life.
They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance -- as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood.
And they are asking -- we should all be asking -- how do we use this time?
How do we live it successfully?
What is the appropriate new metaphor for aging?
I've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject.
And I have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging is a staircase -- the upward ascension of the human spirit, bringing us into wisdom, wholeness and authenticity.
Age not at all as pathology; age as potential.
And guess what?
This potential is not for the lucky few.
It turns out, most people over 50 feel better, are less stressed, are less hostile, less anxious.
We tend to see commonalities more than differences.
Some of the studies even say we're happier.
This is not what I expected, trust me.
I come from a long line of depressives.
As I was approaching my late 40s, when I would wake up in the morning my first six thoughts would all be negative.
And I got scared.
I thought, oh my gosh.
I'm going to become a crotchety old lady.
But now that I am actually smack-dab in the middle of my own third act, I realize I've never been happier.
I have such a powerful feeling of well-being.
And I've discovered that when you're inside oldness, as opposed to looking at it from the outside, fear subsides.
You realize, you're still yourself -- maybe even more so.
Picasso once said, "It takes a long time to become young."
I don't want to romanticize aging.
Obviously, there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth.
Some of it is a matter of luck.
Some of it, obviously, is genetic.
One third of it, in fact, is genetic.
And there isn't much we can do about that.
But that means that two-thirds of how well we do in the third act, we can do something about.
We're going to discuss what we can do to make these added years really successful and use them to make a difference.
Now let me say something about the staircase, which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs.
Myself included.
As you may know, the entire world operates on a universal law: entropy, the second law of thermodynamics.
Entropy means that everything in the world, everything, is in a state of decline and decay, the arch.
There's only one exception to this universal law, and that is the human spirit, which can continue to evolve upwards -- the staircase -- bringing us into wholeness, authenticity and wisdom.
And here's an example of what I mean.
This upward ascension can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges.
About three years ago, I read an article in the New York Times.
It was about a man named Neil Selinger -- 57 years old, a retired lawyer -- who had joined the writers group at Sarah Lawrence where he found his writer's voice.
Two years later, he was diagnosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
It's a terrible disease. It's fatal.
It wastes the body, but the mind remains intact.
In this article, Mr. Selinger wrote the following to describe what was happening to him.
And I quote, "As my muscles weakened, my writing became stronger.
As I slowly lost my speech, I gained my voice.
As I diminished, I grew.
As I lost so much, I finally started to find myself."
Neil Selinger, to me, is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act.
Now we're all born with spirit, all of us, but sometimes it gets tamped down beneath the challenges of life, violence, abuse, neglect.
Perhaps our parents suffered from depression.
Perhaps they weren't able to love us beyond how we performed in the world.
Perhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain, a wound.
Perhaps we feel that many of our relationships have not had closure.
And so we can feel unfinished.
Perhaps the task of the third act is to finish up the task of finishing ourselves.
For me, it began as I was approaching my third act, my 60th birthday.
How was I supposed to live it?
What was I supposed to accomplish in this final act?
And I realized that, in order to know where I was going, I had to know where I'd been.
And so I went back and I studied my first two acts, trying to see who I was then, who I really was -- not who my parents or other people told me I was, or treated me like I was.
But who was I? Who were my parents -- not as parents, but as people?
Who were my grandparents?
How did they treat my parents?
These kinds of things.
I discovered a couple of years later that this process that I had gone through is called by psychologists "doing a life review."
And they say it can give new significance and clarity and meaning to a person's life.
You may discover, as I did, that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault, a lot of things you used to think about yourself, really had nothing to do with you.
It wasn't your fault; you're just fine.
And you're able to go back and forgive them and forgive yourself.
You're able to free yourself from your past.
You can work to change your relationship to your past.
Now while I was writing about this, I came upon a book called "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl.
Viktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist who'd spent five years in a Nazi concentration camp.
And he wrote that, while he was in the camp, he could tell, should they ever be released, which of the people would be okay and which would not.
And he wrote this: "Everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.
This is what determines the quality of the life we've lived -- not whether we've been rich or poor, famous or unknown, healthy or suffering.
What determines our quality of life is how we relate to these realities, what kind of meaning we assign them, what kind of attitude we cling to about them, what state of mind we allow them to trigger."
Perhaps the central purpose of the third act is to go back and to try, if appropriate, to change our relationship to the past.
It turns out that cognitive research shows when we are able to do this, it manifests neurologically -- neural pathways are created in the brain.
You see, if you have, over time, reacted negatively to past events and people, neural pathways are laid down by chemical and electrical signals that are sent through the brain.
And over time, these neural pathways become hardwired, they become the norm -- even if it's bad for us because it causes us stress and anxiety.
If however, we can go back and alter our relationship, re-vision our relationship to past people and events, neural pathways can change.
And if we can maintain the more positive feelings about the past, that becomes the new norm.
It's like resetting a thermostat.
It's not having experiences that make us wise, it's reflecting on the experiences that we've had that makes us wise -- and that helps us become whole, brings wisdom and authenticity.
It helps us become what we might have been.
Women start off whole, don't we?
I mean, as girls, we start off feisty -- "Yeah, who says?"
We have agency.
We are the subjects of our own lives.
But very often, many, if not most of us, when we hit puberty, we start worrying about fitting in and being popular.
And we become the subjects and objects of other people's lives.
But now, in our third acts, it may be possible for us to circle back to where we started and know it for the first time.
And if we can do that, it will not just be for ourselves.
Older women are the largest demographic in the world.
If we can go back and redefine ourselves and become whole, this will create a cultural shift in the world, and it will give an example to younger generations so that they can reconceive their own lifespan.
Thank you very much.

When we think of games, there's all kinds of things.
Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe you're looking forward to a new game. You've been up too late playing a game.
All these things happen to me.
But when we think about games, a lot of times we think about stuff like this: first-person shooters, or the big, what we would call AAA games, or maybe you're a Facebook game player.
This is one my partner and I worked on.
Maybe you play Facebook games, and that's what we're making right now. This is a lighter form of game.
Maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in Thanksgiving situations.
This would be one of those tragically boring board games that you can figure out.
Or maybe you're in your living room, you know, playing with the Wii with the kids, or something like that, and, you know, there's this whole range of games, and that's very much what I think about.
I make my living from games. I've been lucky enough to do this since I was 15, which also qualifies as I've never really had a real job.
But we think about games as fun, and that's completely reasonable, but let's just think about this.
So this one here, this is the 1980 Olympics.
Now I don't know where you guys were, but I was in my living room. It was practically a religious event.
And this is when the Americans beat the Russians, and this was -- yes, it was technically a game.
Hockey is a game. But really, was this a game?
I mean, people cried. I've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of Monopoly.
And so this was just an amazing experience.
Or, you know, if anybody here is from Boston -- So when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series after, I believe, 351 years, when they won the World Series, it was amazing.
I happened to be living in Springfield at the time, and the best part of it was -- is that -- you would close the women's door in the bathroom, and I remember seeing "Go Sox," and I thought, really?
Or the houses, you'd come out, because every game, well, I think almost every game, went into overtime, right?
So we'd be outside, and all the other lights are on on the whole block, and kids, like, the attendance was down in school, and kids weren't going to school.
But it's okay, it's the Red Sox, right?
I mean, there's education, and then there's the Red Sox, and we know where they're stacked.
So this was an amazing experience, and again, yes, it was a game, but they didn't write newspaper articles, people didn't say -- you know, really, "I can die now because the Red Sox won." And many people did.
So games, it means something more to us.
It absolutely means something more.
So now, just, this is an abrupt transition here.
There was three years where I actually did have a real job, sort of.
I was the head of a college department teaching games, so, again, it was sort of a real job, and now I just got to talk about making as opposed to making them.
And I was at a dinner. Part of the job of it, when you're a chair of a department, is to eat, and I did that very well, and so I'm out at a dinner with this guy called Zig Jackson.
So this is Zig in this photograph. This is also one of Zig's photographs. He's a photographer.
And he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself, and you can see here he's got Zig's Indian Reservation. And this particular shot, this is one of the more traditional shots. This is a rain dancer.
And this is one of my favorite shots here.
So you can look at this, and maybe you've even seen things like this. This is an expression of culture, right?
And this is actually from his Degradation series.
And what was most fascinating to me about this series is just, look at that little boy there.
Can you imagine? Now let's, we can see that's a traditional Native American. Now I just want to change that guy's race.
Just imagine if that's a black guy.
So, "Honey, come here, let's get your picture with the black guy."
Right? Like, seriously, nobody would do this.
It baffles the mind. And so Zig, being Indian, likewise it baffles his mind. His favorite photograph -- my favorite photograph of his, which I don't have in here is Indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of Indians.
So I happen to be at dinner with this photographer, and he was talking with another photographer about a shooting that had occurred, and it was on an Indian reservation. He'd taken his camera up there to photograph it, but when he got there, he discovered he couldn't do it. He just couldn't capture the picture. And so they were talking back and forth about this question. Do you take the picture or not?
And that was fascinating to me as a game designer, because it never occurs to me, like, should I make the game about this difficult topic or not?
Because we just make things that are fun or, you know, will make you feel fear, you know, that visceral excitement.
But every other medium does it.
So this is my kid. This is Maezza, and when she was seven years old, she came home from school one day, and like I do every single day, I asked her, "What'd you do today?"
So she said, "We talked about the Middle Passage."
Now, this was a big moment. Maezza's dad is black, and I knew this day was coming. I wasn't expecting it at seven. I don't know why, but I wasn't.
Anyways, so I asked her, "How do you feel about that?"
So she proceeded to tell me, and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here.
So the ships start in England, they come down from England, they go to Africa, they go across the ocean -- that's the Middle Passage part — they come to America where the slaves are sold, she's telling me.
But Abraham Lincoln was elected president, and then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation, and now they're free.
Pause for about 10 seconds.
"Can I play a game, Mommy?"
And I thought, that's it? And so, you know, this is the Middle Passage, this is an incredibly significant event, and she's treating it like, basically some black people went on a cruise, is more or less how it sounds to her.
And so, to me, I wanted more value in this, so when she asked if she could play a game, I said, "Yes."
And so I happened to have all of these little pieces.
I'm a game designer, so I have this stuff sitting around my house.
So I said, "Yeah, you can play a game," and I give her a bunch of these, and I tell her to paint them in different families. These are pictures of Maezza when she was — God, it still chokes me up seeing these.
So she's painting her little families.
So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat.
This was the boat. It was made quickly obviously.
And so the basic gist of it is, I grabbed a bunch of families, and she's like, "Mommy, but you forgot the pink baby and you forgot the blue daddy and you forgot all these other things."
And she says, "They want to go." And I said, "Honey, no they don't want to go. This is the Middle Passage.
Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage."
So she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother, and as we're going across the ocean, following these rules, she realizes that she's rolling pretty high, and she says to me, "We're not going to make it."
And she realizes, you know, we don't have enough food, and so she asks what to do, and I say, "Well, we can either" -- Remember, she's seven -- "We can either put some people in the water or we can hope that they don't get sick and we make it to the other side."
And she -- just the look on her face came over and she said -- now mind you this is after a month of -- this is Black History Month, right?
After a month she says to me, "Did this really happen?"
And I said, "Yes." And so she said, "So, if I came out of the woods" — this is her brother and sister — "If I came out of the woods, Avalon and Donovan might be gone." "Yes."
"But I'd get to see them in America." "No."
"But what if I saw them? You know, couldn't we stay together?" "No."
"So Daddy could be gone." "Yes."
And she was fascinated by this, and she started to cry, and I started to cry, and her father started to cry, and now we're all crying. He didn't expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage, but there it goes.
And so, we made this game, and she got it.
She got it because she spent time with these people.
It wasn't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie.
And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience.
This is the game, which I've ended up calling The New World, because I like the phrase.
I don't think the New World felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships.
But when this happened, I saw the whole planet.
I was so excited. It was like, I'd been making games for 20-some years, and then I decided to do it again.
My history is Irish.
So this is a game called Síochán Leat. It's "peace be with you."
It's the entire history of my family in a single game.
I made another game called Train.
I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics, and if you're going to cover a difficult topic, this is one you need to cover, and I'll let you figure out what that's about on your own.
And I also made a game about the Trail of Tears.
This is a game with 50,000 individual pieces.
I was crazy when I decided to start it, but I'm in the middle of it now.
It's the same thing.
I'm hoping that I'll teach culture through these games.
And the one I'm working on right now, which is -- because I'm right in the middle of it, and these for some reason choke me up like crazy -- is a game called Mexican Kitchen Workers.
And originally it was a math problem more or less.
Like, here's the economics of illegal immigration.
And the more I learned about the Mexican culture -- my partner is Mexican — the more I learned that, you know, for all of us, food is a basic need, but, and it is obviously with Mexicans too, but it's much more than that.
It's an expression of love. It's an expression of — God, I'm totally choking up way more than I thought.
I'll look away from the picture.
It's an expression of beauty. It's how they say they love you.
It's how they say they care, and you can't hear somebody talk about their Mexican grandmother without saying "food" in the first sentence.
And so to me, this beautiful culture, this beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games.
And so games, for a change, it changes how we see topics, it changes how our perceptions about those people in topics, and it changes ourselves.
We change as people through games, because we're involved, and we're playing, and we're learning as we do so. Thank you.

I am a papercutter.
I cut stories.
So my process is very straightforward.
I take a piece of paper, I visualize my story, sometimes I sketch, sometimes I don't.
And as my image is already inside the paper, I just have to remove what's not from that story.
So I didn't come to papercutting in a straight line.
In fact, I see it more as a spiral.
I was not born with a blade in my hand.
And I don't remember papercutting as a child.
As a teenager, I was sketching, drawing, and I wanted to be an artist.
But I was also a rebel.
And I left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs.
So among them, I have been a shepherdess, a truck driver, a factory worker, a cleaning lady.
I worked in tourism for one year in Mexico, one year in Egypt.
I moved for two years in Taiwan.
And then I settled in New York where I became a tour guide.
And I still worked as a tour leader, traveled back and forth in China, Tibet and Central Asia.
So of course, it took time, and I was nearly 40, and I decided it's time to start as an artist.
I chose papercutting because paper is cheap, it's light, and you can use it in a lot of different ways.
And I chose the language of silhouette because graphically it's very efficient.
And it's also just getting to the essential of things.
So the word "silhouette" comes from a minister of finance, Etienne de Silhouette.
And he slashed so many budgets that people said they couldn't afford paintings anymore, and they needed to have their portrait "a la silhouette."
So I made series of images, cuttings, and I assembled them in portfolios.
And people told me -- like these 36 views of the Empire State building -- they told me, "You're making artist books."
So artist books have a lot of definitions.
They come in a lot of different shapes.
But to me, they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story.
They can be with words or without words.
And I have a passion for images and for words.
I love pun and the relation to the unconscious.
I love oddities of languages.
And everywhere I lived, I learned the languages, but never mastered them.
So I'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages.
So as you can guess, my mother tongue is French.
And my daily language is English.
So I did a series of work where it was identical words in French and in English.
So one of these works is the "Spelling Spider."
So the Spelling Spider is a cousin of the spelling bee.
But it's much more connected to the Web.
And this spider spins a bilingual alphabet.
So you can read "architecture active" or "active architecture."
So this spider goes through the whole alphabet with identical adjectives and substantives.
So if you don't know one of these languages, it's instant learning.
And one ancient form of the book is scrolls.
So scrolls are very convenient, because you can create a large image on a very small table.
So the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image, so it makes a very freestyle architecture.
And I'm making all those kinds of windows.
So it's to look beyond the surface.
It's to have a look at different worlds.
And very often I've been an outsider.
So I want to see how things work and what's happening.
So each window is an image and is a world that I often revisit.
And I revisit this world thinking about the image or cliché about what we want to do, and what are the words, colloquialisms, that we have with the expressions.
It's all if.
So what if we were living in balloon houses?
It would make a very uplifting world.
And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet.
It would be so light.
So sometimes I view from the inside, like EgoCentriCity and the inner circles.
Sometimes it's a global view, to see our common roots and how we can use them to catch dreams.
And we can use them also as a safety net.
And my inspirations are very eclectic.
I'm influenced by everything I read, everything I see.
I have some stories that are humorous, like "Dead Beats."
Other ones are historical.
Here it's "CandyCity."
It's a non-sugar-coated history of sugar.
It goes from slave trade to over-consumption of sugar with some sweet moments in between.
And sometimes I have an emotional response to news, such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake.
Other times, it's not even my stories.
People tell me their lives, their memories, their aspirations, and I create a mindscape.
I channel their history [so that] they have a place to go back to look at their life and its possibilities.
I call them Freudian cities.
I cannot speak for all my images, so I'll just go through a few of my worlds just with the title.
"ModiCity."
"ElectriCity."
"MAD Growth on Columbus Circle."
"ReefCity."
"A Web of Time."
"Chaos City."
"Daily Battles."
"FeliCity."
"Floating Islands."
And at one point, I had to do "The Whole Nine Yards."
So it's actually a papercut that's nine yards long.
So in life and in papercutting, everything is connected.
One story leads to another.
I was also interested in the physicality of this format, because you have to walk to see it.
And parallel to my cutting is my running.
I started with small images, I started with a few miles.
Larger images, I started to run marathons.
Then I went to run 50K, then 60K.
Then I ran 50 miles -- ultramarathons.
And I still feel I'm running, it's just the training to become a long-distance papercutter.
And running gives me a lot of energy.
Here is a three-week papercutting marathon at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City.
The result is "Hells and Heavens."
It's two panels 13 ft. high.
They were installed in the museum on two floors, but in fact, it's a continuous image.
And I call it "Hells and Heavens" because it's daily hells and daily heavens.
There is no border in between.
Some people are born in hells, and against all odds, they make it to heavens.
Other people make the opposite trip.
That's the border.
You have sweatshops in hells.
You have people renting their wings in the heavens.
And then you have all those individual stories where sometimes we even have the same action, and the result puts you in hells or in heavens.
So the whole "Hells and Heavens" is about free will and determinism.
And in papercutting, you have the drawing as the structure itself.
So you can take it off the wall.
Here it's an artist book installation called "Identity Project."
It's not autobiographical identities.
They are more our social identities.
And then you can just walk behind them and try them on.
So it's like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity.
That's another artist book project.
In fact, in the picture, you have two of them.
It's one I'm wearing and one that's on exhibition at the Center for Books Arts in New York City.
Why do I call it a book?
It's called "Fashion Statement," and there are quotes about fashion, so you can read it, and also, because the definition of artist book is very generous.
So artist books, you take them off the wall.
You take them for a walk.
You can also install them as public art.
Here it's in Scottsdale, Arizona, and it's called "Floating Memories."
So it's regional memories, and they are just randomly moved by the wind.
I love public art.
And I entered competitions for a long time.
After eight years of rejection, I was thrilled to get my first commission with the Percent for Art in New York City.
It was for a merger station for emergency workers and firemen.
I made an artist book that's in stainless steel instead of paper.
I called it "Working in the Same Direction."
But I added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions.
With public art, I could also make cut glass.
Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx.
And each time I make public art, I want something that's really relevant to the place it's installed.
So for the subway in New York, I saw a correspondence between riding the subway and reading.
It is travel in time, travel on time.
And Bronx literature, it's all about Bronx writers and their stories.
Another glass project is in a public library in San Jose, California.
So I made a vegetable point of view of the growth of San Jose.
So I started in the center with the acorn for the Ohlone Indian civilization.
Then I have the fruit from Europe for the ranchers.
And then the fruit of the world for Silicon Valley today.
And it's still growing.
So the technique, it's cut, sandblasted, etched and printed glass into architectural glass.
And outside the library, I wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind.
I took library material that had fruit in their title and I used them to make an orchard walk with these fruits of knowledge.
I also planted the bibliotree.
So it's a tree, and in its trunk you have the roots of languages.
And it's all about international writing systems.
And on the branches you have library material growing.
You can also have function and form with public art.
So in Aurora, Colorado it's a bench.
But you have a bonus with this bench.
Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts, you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs.
Another functional work, it's in the south side of Chicago for a subway station.
And it's called "Seeds of the Future are Planted Today."
It's a story about transformation and connections.
So it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter, and not to have objects falling on the rails.
To be able to change fences and window guards into flowers, it's fantastic.
And here I've been working for the last three years with a South Bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing.
So each building has its own personality.
And sometimes it's about a legacy of the neighborhood, like in Morrisania, about the jazz history.
And for other projects, like in Paris, it's about the name of the street.
It's called Rue des Prairies -- Prairie Street.
So I brought back the rabbit, the dragonfly, to stay in that street.
And in 2009, I was asked to make a poster to be placed in the subway cars in New York City for a year.
So that was a very captive audience.
And I wanted to give them an escape.
I created "All Around Town."
It is a papercutting, and then after, I added color on the computer.
So I can call it techno-crafted.
And along the way, I'm kind of making papercuttings and adding other techniques.
But the result is always to have stories.
So the stories, they have a lot of possibilities.
They have a lot of scenarios.
I don't know the stories.
I take images from our global imagination, from cliché, from things we are thinking about, from history.
And everybody's a narrator, because everybody has a story to tell.
But more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world.
And in all these universes, it's like imagination is the vehicle to be transported with, but the destination is our minds and how we can reconnect with the essential and with the magic.
And it's what story cutting is all about.

Yeah, so a couple of years ago I was turning 60, and I don't like being 60.
And I started grappling with this existential angst of what little I had done with my life.
It wasn't the resume of breaking this record here, it was more like, who had I become?
How had I spent my valuable time?
How could this have gone by like lightning?
And I couldn't forgive myself for the countless, countless hours I had lost in negative thought -- all the time I had spent beating myself up for losing my marriage and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid and career moves and this and this and this.
Just why, why didn't I do it better? Why? Why? Why?
And then my mother died at 82.
And so I starting thinking, not only am I not happy with the past, now I'm getting choked with, "I've only got 22 years left."
What am I going to do with this short amount of time that's just fleeting?
And I'm not in the present whatsoever.
And I decided the remedy to all this malaise was going to be for me to chase an elevated dream, an extreme dream, something that would require utter conviction and unwavering passion, something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life, every minute of every day, because the dream was so big that I couldn't get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction.
And I decided, it was an old dream that was lingering, that was from so many years ago, three decades ago -- the only sort of world class swim I had tried and failed at back in my 20s -- was going from Cuba to Florida.
It was deep in my imagination.
No one's ever done it without a shark cage.
It's daunting.
It's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean.
It's probably, at my speed, at my age -- for anybody's speed at anybody's age -- going to take 60, maybe 70, hours of continuous swimming, never getting out on the boat.
And I started to train.
I hadn't swum for 31 years, not a stroke.
And I had kept in good shape, but swimming's a whole different animal.
As a matter of fact, this picture is supposed to be me during training.
It's a smiling face.
And when you're training for this sport, you are not smiling.
It's an arduous, difficult sport, and I don't remember smiling at any time during this sport.
As I said, I respect other sports, and I compare this sport sometimes to cycling and to mountain climbing and other of the expedition type events, but this is a sensory deprivation, a physical duress.
And when I started in with the eight hours and the 10 hours and the 12 hours and the 14 hours and the 15 hours and the 24-hour swims, I knew I had it, because I was making it through these.
And when I said I'm going to go out and do a 15-hour swim, and we're coming into the dock after a long day and it's now night, and we come in and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes and I can touch the dock and we're done, the trainer says, "That's great.
It's 14 hours 58 minutes. Who cares the last two minutes?"
I say, "No, it's got to be 15 hours," and I swim another minute out and another minute back to make the 15 hours.
And I put together an expedition.
It's not that I didn't have help, but honestly, I sort of led, I was the team leader.
And to get the government permissions, you read in the paper, you think it's easy to get into Cuba everyday?
Try going in with an armada like we had of 50 people and five boats and CNN's crew, etc.
The navigation is difficult.
There's a big river called the Gulf Stream that runs across and it's not going in the direction you are.
It's going to the east and you'd like to go north.
It's tricky.
And there's dehydration.
And there's hypothermia.
And there are sharks.
And there are all kinds of problems.
And I gathered together, honestly, the world's leading experts in every possible way.
And a month ago, the 23rd of September, I stood on that shore and I looked across to that long, long faraway horizon and I asked myself, do you have it?
Are your shoulders ready?
And they were. They were prepared.
No stone left unturned.
Was the mind ready?
You know, you're swimming with the fogged goggles, you're swimming at 60 strokes a minute, so you're never really focused on anything, you don't see well.
You've got tight bathing caps over your ears trying to keep the heat of the head, because it's where the hypothermia starts, and so you don't hear very well.
You're really left alone with your own thoughts.
And I had all kinds of counting systems ready there in English, followed by German, followed by Spanish, followed by French.
You save the French for last.
And I had songs, I had a playlist in my head -- not through headphones, in my own head -- of 65 songs.
And I couldn't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night, because that's when Neil Young comes out.
And it's odd, isn't it?
You'd think you'd be singing Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" out in the majesty of the ocean, not songs about heroin addiction in New York City.
But no, for some reason I couldn't wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing, "A heard you knocking at my cellar door I love you baby and I want some more Ooh, ooh, the damage done" The night before I started, I finished Stephen Hawking's "The Grand Design."
And I couldn't wait to trip the mind fantastic.
About the 50th hour, I was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe.
Is there an edge?
Is this an envelope we're living inside of, or no, does it go onto infinity in both time and space?
And there's nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this.
I couldn't wait to prove the athlete I am, that nobody else in the world can do this swim.
And I knew I could do it.
And when I jumped into that water, I yelled in my mother's French, "Courage!"
And I started swimming, and, oh my God, it was glassy.
And we knew it, all 50 people on the boat, we all knew this was it, this was our time.
And I reminded myself a couple hours in, you know, the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself.
First of all, you're going to hit obstacles.
And even though you're feeling great at any one moment, don't take it for granted, be ready, because there's going to be pain, there's going to be suffering.
It's not going to feel this good all the way across.
And I was thinking of the hypothermia and maybe some shoulder pain and all the other things -- the vomiting that comes from being in the saltwater.
You're immersed in the liquid.
Your body doesn't like the saltwater.
After a couple of days, three days, you tend to rebel in a lot of physical ways.
But no, two hours in, wham! Never in my life ...
I knew there were Portuguese men o' war, all kinds of moon jellies, all kinds of things, but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters.
And I was on fire -- excruciating, excruciating pain.
I don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm.
Evidently, a piece this big of tentacle has a hundred-thousand little barbs on it and each barb is not just stinging your skin, it's sending a venom.
The most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish.
And every one of those barbs is sending that venom into this central nervous system.
So first I feel like boiling hot oil, I've been dipped in.
And I'm yelling out, "Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
Help me! Somebody help me!"
And the next thing is paralysis.
I feel it in the back and then I feel it in the chest up here, and I can't breathe.
And now I'm not swimming with a nice long stroke, I'm sort of crabbing it this way.
Then come convulsions.
A young man on our boat is an EMT. He dives in to try to help me.
He's stung.
They drag him out on the boat, and he's -- evidently, I didn't see any of this -- but lying on the boat and giving himself epinephrine shots and crying out.
He's 29 years old, very well-built, lean, he's six-foot, five, weighs 265 lbs., and he is down.
And he is crying and he's yelling to my trainer who's trying to help me.
And he's saying, "Bonnie, I think I'm going to die.
My breath is down to three breaths a minute.
I need help, and I can't help Diana."
So that was at eight o'clock at night.
The doctor, medical team from University of Miami arrived at five in the morning.
So I swam through the night, and at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots.
I didn't get out, but was in the water taking prednisone shots, taking Xanax, oxygen to the face.
It was like an ICU unit in the water.
And I guess the story is that even Navy SEALS who are stung by the box jelly, they're done.
They either die or they quickly get to a hospital.
And I swam through the night and I swam through the next day.
And the next night at dusk, again, wham!
The box jelly again -- all across the neck, all across here.
And this time, I don't like it, I didn't want to give into it, but there's a difference between a non-stop swim and a staged swim.
And I gave in to the staged swim.
And they got me out and they started again with the epinephrine and the prednisone and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board.
And I got back in.
And I swam through that night and into the next day.
And at 41 hours, this body couldn't make it.
The devastation of those stings had taken the respiratory system down so that I couldn't make the progress I wanted.
And the dream was crushed.
And how odd is this intelligent person who put this together and got all these world experts together.
And I knew about the jellyfish, but I was sort of cavalier.
A lot of athletes have this, you know, sort of invincibility.
They should worry about me. I don't worry about them.
I'll just swim right through them.
We've got benadryl on board. If I get stung, I'll just grin and bear it.
Well there was no grin and bearing this.
As a matter of fact, the best advice I got was from an elementary school class in the Caribbean.
And I was telling these kids, 120 of them -- they were all in the school on the gymnasium floor -- and I was telling them about the jellyfish and how they're gelatinous and you can't see them at night especially.
And they have these long 30 to 40 to 50-ft. tentacles.
And they do this wrapping.
And they can send the poison into the system.
And a little kid from the back was like this.
And I said, "What's your name?" "Henry."
"Henry, what's your question?"
He said, "Well, I didn't have a question so much as I had a suggestion."
He said, "You know those guys who really believe in what they believe in and so they wear bombs?"
And I said, "Well it's odd that you've learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit, but yeah, I know those guys."
He said, "That's what you need.
You need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this."
"And when the jellyfish come and they wrap their tentacles around the fish, they're going to be busy with them, and you'll just scoot around."
I said, "Oh, it's like a suicide army."
He said, "That's what I'm talking about. That's what you need."
And little did I know, that you should listen to eight year-olds.
And so I started that swim in a bathing suit like normal, and, no joke, this is it; it came from the shark divers.
I finished the swim like this.
I was swimming with this thing on.
That's how scared of the jellyfish I was.
So now what do I do?
I wouldn't mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight and told us how you've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives.
Because we've all had them, haven't we?
We've all had a heartache.
And so my journey now is to find some sort of grace in the face of this defeat.
And I can look at the journey, not just the destination.
I can feel proud. I can stand here in front of you tonight and say I was courageous.
Yeah.
Thank you.
And with all sincerity, I can say, I am glad I lived those two years of my life that way, because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore, I got there with that goal.
When you live that way, when you live with that kind of passion, there's no time, there's no time for regrets, you're just moving forward.
And I want to live every day of the rest of my life that way, swim or no swim.
But the difference in accepting this particular defeat is that sometimes, if cancer has won, if there's death and we have no choice, then grace and acceptance are necessary.
But that ocean's still there.
This hope is still alive.
And I don't want to be the crazy woman who does it for years and years and years, and tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails, but I can swim from Cuba to Florida, and I will swim from Cuba to Florida.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And so, what after that?
Are you going to swim the Atlantic?
No, that's the last swim.
It's the only swim I'm interested in.
But I'm ready.
And by the way, a reporter called me the other day and he said he looked on Wikipedia and he said he saw my birthday was August 22nd 1949, and for some odd reason in Wikipedia, they had my death date too.
He said, "Did you know you're going to die the same place you were born, New York City, and it's going to be in January of '35?"
I said, "Nope. I didn't know."
And now I'm going to live to 85.
I have three more years than I thought.
And so I ask myself, I'm starting to ask myself now, even before this extreme dream gets achieved for me, I'm asking myself, and maybe I can ask you tonight too, to paraphrase the poet Mary Oliver, she says, "So what is it, what is it you're doing, with this one wild and precious life of yours?"
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Live it large. Live it large.

<title>Diana Nyad: Extreme swimming with the world's most dangerous jellyfish</title>
<description>In the 1970s, Diana Nyad set long-distance swim records that are still unbroken. Thirty years later, at 60, she attempted her longest swim yet, from Cuba to Florida. In this funny, powerful talk at TEDMED, she talks about how to prepare mentally to achieve an extreme dream, and asks: What will YOU do with your wild, precious life?</description>
<keywords>culture,extreme sports,sports,success</keywords>

A talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery.
And while I've tried to make my images not too graphic, keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do, because, after all, what a surgeon does to a patient, if it were done without consent, would be a felony.
Surgeons are the tailors, the plumbers, the carpenters -- some would say the butchers -- of the medical world: cutting, reshaping, reforming, bypassing, fixing.
But you need to talk about surgical instruments and the evolution of surgical technology together.
So in order to give you some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots, and where we're going to be going in the future, I want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point, how we even came to believe that surgery was OK, that this was something that was possible to do, that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK.
So, a little bit of perspective -- about 10,000 years of perspective.
This is a trephinated skull.
And trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull.
And many, many hundreds of skulls like this have been found in archaeological sites all over the world, dating back five to 10 thousand years.
Five to 10 thousand years! Now imagine this.
You are a healer in a Stone Age village.
And you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him -- Oliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future.
He's got some seizure disorder. And you don't understand this.
But you think to yourself, "I'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy.
But maybe if I cut a hole in his head I can fix it."
Now that is surgical thinking.
Now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here.
What is astonishing about this is, even though we don't know really how much of this was intended to be religious, or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic, what we can tell is that these patients lived!
Judging by the healing on the borders of these holes, they lived days, months, years following trephination.
And so what we are seeing is evidence of a refined technique that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years, all over the world.
This arose independently at sites everywhere that had no communication to one another.
We really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery.
Now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the Bronze Age and beyond.
And we see new refined tools coming out.
But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold, trephinating ancestors.
These guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries.
And surgeons were tradesmen, rather than physicians.
This persisted all the way into and through the Renaissance.
That may have saved the writers, but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much.
They were still a mistrusted lot.
Surgeons still had a bit of a PR problem, because the landscape was dominated by the itinerant barber surgeon.
These were folks that traveled from village to village, town to town, doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art.
Because we were in the age before anesthesia, the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself.
One of the most famous of these guys, Frere Jacques, shown here doing a lithotomy -- which is the removal of the bladder stone, one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time -- had to take less than two minutes.
You had to have quite a flair for the dramatic, and be really, really quick.
And so here you see him doing a lithotomy.
And he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries, wandering around in Europe, which is an astonishing number, when you think that surgery must have been a last resort.
I mean who would put themselves through that?
Until anesthesia, the absence of sensation.
With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler at the Mass. General in 1847, a whole new era of surgery was ushered in.
Anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate.
Anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment, to start to delve deeper into the body.
This was truly a revolution in surgery.
But there was a pretty big problem with this.
After these very long, painstaking operations, attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before, the patients died.
They died of massive infection.
Surgery didn't hurt anymore, but it killed you pretty quickly.
And infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients until the next big revolution in surgery, which was aseptic technique.
Joseph Lister was aepsis's, or sterility's, biggest advocate, to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons.
But eventually they did come around.
The Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe.
And they came back to their American clinic and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery Something so simple.
And yet, operative mortality dropped profoundly.
These surgeries were actually now being effective.
With the patient insensitive to pain, and a sterile operating field all bets were off, the sky was the limit.
You could now start doing surgery everywhere, on the gut, on the liver, on the heart, on the brain.
Transplantation: you could take an organ out of one person, you could put it in another person, and it would work.
Surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore; they had become gods.
The era of the "big surgeon, big incision" had arrived, but at quite a cost, because they are saving lives, but not necessarily quality of life, because healthy people don't usually need surgery, and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that.
The question had to be asked, "Well, can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions?"
Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery: surgery with long instruments through small incisions.
And it really changed the landscape of surgery.
Some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years, but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the 1980s, when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that, that allowed this to be done for real operations.
So what you see -- this is now the first surgical image -- as we're coming down the tube, this is a new entry into the body.
It looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like.
We bring instruments in, from two separate cuts in the side, and then you can start manipulating tissue.
Within 10 years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done laparoscopically, a majority of gallbladder surgeries were being done laparoscopically -- truly a pretty big revolution.
But there were casualties of this revolution.
These techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated.
The learning curve was very long.
And during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher.
Surgeons had to give up their 3D vision.
They had to give up their wrists.
They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments.
This surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience.
Now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle.
But this is hard.
And one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external ergonomics are terrible.
You've got these long instruments, and you're working off your centerline.
And the instruments are essentially working backwards.
So what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand, and put it on the other side of that small incision, is you need to put a wrist on that instrument.
And so -- I get to talk about robots -- the da Vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that incision.
And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist.
And now, in contrast to the laparoscopy, you can precisely place the needle in your instruments, and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory.
And the reason why this becomes so much easier is -- you can see on the bottom -- the hands are making the motions, and the instruments are following those motions exactly.
Now, what you put between those instruments and those hands, is a large, fairly complicated robot.
The surgeon is sitting at a console, and controlling the robot with these controllers.
And the robot is moving these instruments around, and powering them, down inside the body.
You have a 3D camera, so you get a 3D view.
And since this was introduced in 1999, a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy, which is a prostate deep in the pelvis, and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome.
You can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart without cracking the chest.
This is all done in between the ribs.
And you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside.
You've got these technologies -- thank you -- And so you might say, "Wow this is really cool!
So, smartypants, why isn't all surgery being done this way?"
And there are some reasons, some good reasons.
And cost is one of them.
I talked about the large, complicated robot.
With all its bells and whistles, one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon.
More useful than a solid gold surgeon, but, still, it's a fairly big capital investment.
But once you've got it, your procedure costs do come down.
But there are other barriers.
So something like a prostatectomy -- the prostate is small, and it's in one spot, and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot.
And so it's perfect for something like that.
And in fact if you, or anyone you know, had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years, chances are it was done with one of these systems.
But if you need to reach more places than just one, you need to move the robot.
And you need to put some new incisions in there.
And you need to re-set it up.
And then you need to add some more ports, and more.
And the problem is it gets time-consuming, and cumbersome.
And for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren't being done with the da Vinci.
So we had to ask the question, "Well how do we fix that?"
What if we could change it so that we didn't have to re-set up each time we wanted to move somewhere different?
What if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place?
How would that change the capabilities of the surgeon?
And how would that change the experience for the patient?
Now, to do that, we need to be able to bring a camera and instruments in together through one small tube, like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video.
Or, not so coincidentally, like a tube like this.
So what's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology, this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere.
Ready? So here it comes.
This is the camera, and three instruments.
And as you see it come out, in order to actually be able to do anything useful, it can't all stay clustered up like this.
It has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline.
He's a cheeky little devil.
But what this lets you do is gives you that all-important traction, and counter-traction, so that you can dissect, so that you can sew, so that you can do all the things that you need to do, all the surgical tasks.
But it's all coming in through one incision.
It's not so simple.
But it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we're going around.
For the patient, however, it's transparent. This is all they're going to see.
It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this.
We get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery.
As we take these capabilities, and we get to go to the next places, we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be.
And I think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution, we need to not just take our hands in in new ways, we also need to take our eyes in in new ways.
We need to see beyond the surface.
We need to be able to guide what we're cutting in a much better way.
This is a cancer surgery.
One of the problems with this, even for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot, is you can't see the cancer, especially when it's hidden below the surface.
And so what we're starting to do is we're starting to inject specially designed markers into the bloodstream that will target the cancer.
It will go, bind to the cancer.
And we can make those markers glow.
And we can take special cameras, and we can look at it.
Now we know where we need to cut, even when it's below the surface.
We can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site.
And we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site, so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel.
We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream, so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart, we can see if we actually made the connection, before we close that patient back up again -- something that we haven't been able to do without radiation before.
We can light up tumors like this kidney tumor, so that you can exactly see where the boundary is between the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind, or the liver tumor and the liver you want to leave behind.
And we don't even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision.
We have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body.
And we can look at cells directly.
I'm looking at nerves here. So these are nerves you see, down on the bottom, and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand, up at the top.
So this is all very prototypey at this point.
But you care about nerves, if you are a surgical patient.
Because they let you keep continence, bladder control, and sexual function after surgery, all of which is generally fairly important to the patient.
So, with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all, and we can see it all.
We can heal the disease.
And we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards.
Now, I've talked about the patient as if the patient is, somehow, someone abstract outside this room.
And that is not the case.
Many of you, all of you maybe, will at some point, or have already, faced a diagnosis of cancer, or heart disease, or some organ dysfunction that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon.
And when you get to that point -- I mean, these maladies don't care how many books you've written, how many companies you've started, that Nobel Prize you have yet to win, how much time you planned to spend with your children.
These maladies come for us all.
And the prospect I'm offering you, of an easier surgery ...
is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying?
I'm not sure I really even want it to.
Because facing your own mortality causes a re-evaluation of priorities, and a realignment of what your goals are in life, unlike anything else.
And I would never want to deprive you of that epiphany.
What I want instead, is for you to be whole, intact, and functional enough to go out and save the world, after you've decided you need to do it.
And that is my vision for your future.
Thank you.

Miranda Wang: We're here to talk about accidents.
How do you feel about accidents?
When we think about accidents, we usually consider them to be harmful, unfortunate or even dangerous, and they certainly can be.
But are they always that bad?
The discovery that had led to penicillin, for example, is one of the most fortunate accidents of all time.
Without biologist Alexander Fleming's moldy accident, caused by a neglected workstation, we wouldn't be able to fight off so many bacterial infections.
Jeanny Yao: Miranda and I are here today because we'd like to share how our accidents have led to discoveries.
In 2011, we visited the Vancouver Waste Transfer Station and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste.
We realized that when plastics get to the dump, it's difficult to sort them because they have similar densities, and when they're mixed with organic matter and construction debris, it's truly impossible to pick them out and environmentally eliminate them.
MW: However, plastics are useful because they're durable, flexible, and can be easily molded into so many useful shapes.
The downside of this convenience is that there's a high cost to this.
Plastics cause serious problems, such as the destruction of ecosystems, the pollution of natural resources, and the reduction of available land space.
This picture you see here is the Great Pacific Gyre.
When you think about plastic pollution and the marine environment, we think about the Great Pacific Gyre, which is supposed to be a floating island of plastic waste.
But that's no longer an accurate depiction of plastic pollution in the marine environment.
Right now, the ocean is actually a soup of plastic debris, and there's nowhere you can go in the ocean where you wouldn't be able to find plastic particles.
JY: In a plastic-dependent society, cutting down production is a good goal, but it's not enough.
And what about the waste that's already been produced?
Plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade.
So we thought, you know what?
Instead of waiting for that garbage to sit there and pile up, let's find a way to break them down with bacteria.
Sounds cool, right?
Audience: Yeah. JY: Thank you.
But we had a problem.
You see, plastics have very complex structures and are difficult to biodegrade.
Anyhow, we were curious and hopeful and still wanted to give it a go.
MW: With this idea in mind, Jeanny and I read through some hundreds of scientific articles on the Internet, and we drafted a research proposal in the beginning of our grade 12 year.
We aimed to find bacteria from our local Fraser River that can degrade a harmful plasticizer called phthalates.
Phthalates are additives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexibility, durability and transparency.
Although they're part of the plastic, they're not covalently bonded to the plastic backbone.
As a result, they easily escape into our environment.
Not only do phthalates pollute our environment, but they also pollute our bodies.
To make the matter worse, phthalates are found in products to which we have a high exposure, such as babies' toys, beverage containers, cosmetics, and even food wraps.
Phthalates are horrible because they're so easily taken into our bodies.
They can be absorbed by skin contact, ingested, and inhaled.
JY: Every year, at least 470 million pounds of phthalates contaminate our air, water and soil.
The Environmental Protection Agency even classified this group as a top-priority pollutant because it's been shown to cause cancer and birth defects by acting as a hormone disruptor.
We read that each year, the Vancouver municipal government monitors phthalate concentration levels in rivers to assess their safety.
So we figured, if there are places along our Fraser River that are contaminated with phthalates, and if there are bacteria that are able to live in these areas, then perhaps, perhaps these bacteria could have evolved to break down phthalates.
MW: So we presented this good idea to Dr. Lindsay Eltis at the University of British Columbia, and surprisingly, he actually took us into his lab and asked his graduate students Adam and James to help us.
Little did we know at that time that a trip to the dump and some research on the Internet and plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration would take us on a life-changing journey of accidents and discoveries.
JY: The first step in our project was to collect soil samples from three different sites along the Fraser River.
Out of thousands of bacteria, we wanted to find ones that could break down phthalates, so we enriched our cultures with phthalates as the only carbon source.
This implied that, if anything grew in our cultures, then they must be able to live off of phthalates.
Everything went well from there, and we became amazing scientists.
MW: Um ... uh, Jeanny. JY: I'm just joking.
MW: Okay. Well, it was partially my fault.
You see, I accidentally cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture, and as a result, we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice.
And this is only one of the examples of the many accidents that happened during our experimentation.
But this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous.
We noticed that the unharmed cultures came from places of opposite contamination levels, so this mistake actually led us to think that perhaps we can compare the different degradative potentials of bacteria from sites of opposite contamination levels.
JY: Now that we grew the bacteria, we wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates, because we thought that would be less accident-prone, but we were wrong again.
We poked holes in our agar while streaking and contaminated some samples and funghi.
As a result, we had to streak and restreak several times.
Then we monitored phthalate utilization and bacterial growth, and found that they shared an inverse correlation, so as bacterial populations increased, phthalate concentrations decreased.
This means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates.
MW: So now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates, we wondered what these bacteria were.
So Jeanny and I took three of our most efficient strains and then performed gene amplification sequencing on them and matched our data with an online comprehensive database.
We were happy to see that, although our three strains had been previously identified bacteria, two of them were not previously associated with phthalate degradation, so this was actually a novel discovery.
JY: To better understand how this biodegradation works, we wanted to verify the catabolic pathways of our three strains.
To do this, we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid.
MW: We monitored this experiment with spectrophotometry and obtained this beautiful graph.
This graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates.
Our bacteria can transform phthalates, which is a harmful toxin, into end products such as carbon dioxide, water and alcohol.
I know some of you in the crowd are thinking, well, carbon dioxide is horrible, it's a greenhouse gas.
But if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates, they would have used some other kind of carbon source, and aerobic respiration would have led it to have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway.
We were also interested to see that, although we've obtained greater diversity of bacteria biodegraders from the bird habitat site, we obtained the most efficient degraders from the landfill site.
So this fully shows that nature evolves through natural selection.
JY: So Miranda and I shared this research at the Sanofi BioGENEius Challenge competition and were recognized with the greatest commercialization potential.
Although we're not the first ones to find bacteria that can break down phthalates, we were the first ones to look into our local river and find a possible solution to a local problem.
We have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic pollution, but also that being open to uncertain outcomes and taking risks create opportunities for unexpected discoveries.
Throughout this journey, we have also discovered our passion for science, and are currently continuing research on other fossil fuel chemicals in university.
We hope that in the near future, we'll be able to create model organisms that can break down not only phthalates but a wide variety of different contaminants.
We can apply this to wastewater treatment plants to clean up our rivers and other natural resources.
And perhaps one day we'll be able to tackle the problem of solid plastic waste.
MW: I think our journey has truly transformed our view of microorganisms, and Jeanny and I have shown that even mistakes can lead to discoveries.
Einstein once said, "You can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking you used when you created them."
If we're making plastic synthetically, then we think the solution would be to break them down biochemically.
Thank you. JY: Thank you.

I spent the better part of a decade looking at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide.
And I'd like to start by sharing with you one moment that to me sums up what there is to know about American and democratic responses to mass atrocity.
And that moment came on April 21, 1994.
So 14 years ago, almost, in the middle of the Rwandan genocide, in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated by the Rwandan government and some extremist militia.
On April 21, in the New York Times, the paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people had already been killed in the genocide.
It was in the paper -- not on the front page.
It was a lot like the Holocaust coverage, it was buried in the paper.
Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy, and amazingly, genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy.
But on April 21, a wonderfully honest moment occurred.
And that was that an American congresswoman named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado met with a group of journalists.
And one of the journalists said to her, what's up?
What's going on in the U.S. government?
Two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda.
It's two weeks into the genocide at that time, but of course, at that time you don't know how long it's going to last.
And the journalist said, why is there so little response out of Washington?
Why no hearings, no denunciations, no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House? What's the deal?
And she said -- she was so honest -- she said, "It's a great question.
All I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado and my office in Washington, we're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls about the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda, but nobody is calling about the people.
The phones just aren't ringing about the people."
And the reason I give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it.
And that truth is, or was, in the 20th century, that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements, we didn't have an endangered people's movement.
We had Holocaust education in the schools.
Most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe, but also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust.
There's a museum, of course, on the Mall in Washington, right next to Lincoln and Jefferson.
I mean, we have owned Never Again culturally, appropriately, interestingly.
And yet the politicization of Never Again, the operationalization of Never Again, had never occurred in the 20th century.
And that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows: that if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities, we have to make it such.
There has to be a role -- there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth.
So that was the 20th century.
Now here -- and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon -- there is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century, and that is that, almost out of nowhere, there has come into being an anti-genocide movement, an anti-genocide constituency, and one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent.
It grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur.
It is comprised of students. There are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters on college campuses around the country.
It's bigger than the anti-apartheid movement.
There are something like 500 high school chapters devoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur.
Evangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it.
"Hotel Rwanda" watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement.
To call it a movement, as with all movements, perhaps, is a little misleading.
It's diverse. It's got a lot of different approaches.
It's got all the ups and the downs of movements.
But it has been amazingly successful in one regard, in that it has become, it has congealed into this endangered people's movement that was missing in the 20th century.
It sees itself, such as it is, the it, as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost, there will be a political price to be paid, for allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination, for not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander.
Now because it's student-driven, there's some amazing things that the movement has done.
They have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced, I think, 55 universities in 22 states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in Sudan.
They have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number -- this is going to sound very kitsch, but for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical, but interested in doing something about genocide, you dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code, and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is.
It will refer you directly to your congressperson, to your U.S. senator, to your governor where divestment legislation is pending.
They've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide.
I think the most innovative thing they've introduced recently are genocide grades.
And it takes students to introduce genocide grades.
So what you now have when a Congress is in session is members of Congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds and saying, I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide; what do I do to get a C? I just want to get a C. Help me.
And the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that, and there's always something to do.
Now, what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration from the United States, at a time of massive over-stretch -- military, financial, diplomatic -- a whole series of commitments to Darfur that no other country in the world is making.
For instance, the referral of the crimes in Darfur to the International Criminal Court, which the Bush administration doesn't like.
The expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep, basically, the people who've been displaced from their homes by the Sudanese government, by the so-called Janjaweed, the militia, to keep those people alive until something more durable can be achieved.
And recently, or now not that recently, about six months ago, the authorization of a peacekeeping force of 26,000 that will go.
And that's all the Bush administration's leadership, and it's all because of this bottom-up pressure and the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis.
The bad news, however, to this question of will evil prevail, is that evil lives on.
The people in those camps are surrounded on all sides by so-called Janjaweed, these men on horseback with spears and Kalashnikovs.
Women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid in order to feed their families -- humanitarian aid, the dirty secret of it is it has to be heated, really, to be edible -- are themselves subjected to rape, which is a tool of the genocide that is being used.
And the peacekeepers I've mentioned, the force has been authorized, but almost no country on Earth has stepped forward since the authorization to actually put its troops or its police in harm's way.
So we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century, and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here, as we speak.
Why the limits to the movement?
Why is what has been achieved, or what the movement has done, been necessary but not sufficient to the crime?
I think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on briefly.
The first is that the movement, such as it is, stops at America's borders. It is not a global movement.
It does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide.
And the Holocaust culture that we have in this country makes Americans, sort of, more prone to, I think, want to bring Never Again to life.
The guilt that the Clinton administration expressed, that Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda, created a space in our society for a consensus that Rwanda was bad and wrong and we wish we had done more, and that is something that the movement has taken advantage of.
European governments, for the most part, haven't acknowledged responsibility, and there's nothing to kind of to push back and up against.
So this movement, if it's to be durable and global, will have to cross borders, and you will have to see other citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide, but actually making it such.
Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude naturally or eagerly.
As we saw, they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports or reigning in loose nukes.
Why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering?
So one reason is it hasn't gone global.
The second is, of course, that at this time in particular in America's history, we have a credibility problem, a legitimacy problem in international institutions.
It is structurally really, really hard to do, as the Bush administration rightly does, which is to denounce genocide on a Monday and then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no-brainer and then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments.
Now, other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved.
Let me be clear.
They're in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi.
But it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere, of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world.
The recovery's going to take some time.
We have to ask ourselves, what now? What do we do going forward as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world's worst places, the world's worst suffering, killers, and the kinds of killers that could come home to roost sometime in the future?
The place that I turned to answer that question was to a man that many of you may not have ever heard of, and that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who, as Chris said, was blown up in Iraq in 2003.
He was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in Iraq.
It's hard to remember, but there was actually a time in the summer of 2003, even after the U.S. invasion, where, apart from looting, civilians were relatively safe in Iraq.
Now, who was Sergio? Sergio Vieira de Mello was his name.
In addition to being Brazilian, he was described to me before I met him in 1994 as someone who was a cross between James Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other.
And in the U.N., you don't get that many people who actually manage to merge those qualities.
He was James Bond-like in that he was ingenious.
He was drawn to the flames, he chased the flames, he was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie.
He was successful with women.
He was Bobby Kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist, as people always wondered about Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way.
What he was was a decathlete of nation-building, of problem-solving, of troubleshooting in the world's worst places and in the world's most broken places.
In failing states, genocidal states, under-governed states, precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist on the horizon, and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world's suffering tends to get concentrated.
These are the places he was drawn to.
He moved with the headlines.
He was in the U.N. for 34 years. He joined at the age of 21.
Started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '70s were wars of independence and decolonization.
He was there in Bangladesh dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees -- the largest refugee flow in history up to that point.
He was in Sudan when the civil war broke out there.
He was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion.
He was in Mozambique for the War of Independence.
He was in Lebanon. Amazingly, he was in Lebanon -- the U.N. base was used -- Palestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base.
Israel then invaded and overran the U.N. base.
Sergio was in Beirut when the U.S. Embassy was hit by the first-ever suicide attack against the United States.
People date the beginning of this new era to 9/11, but surely 1983, with the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks -- which Sergio witnessed -- those are, in fact, in some ways, the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today.
From Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '90s.
The issues were, of course, ethnic sectarian violence.
He was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge.
Talk about evil prevailing. I mean, here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia.
He negotiates with the Serbs.
He actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil and trying to convince evil that it doesn't need to prevail that he earns the nickname -- not Sergio but Serbio while he's living in the Balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations.
He then goes to Rwanda and to Congo in the aftermath of the genocide, and he's the guy who has to decide -- huh, OK, the genocide is over; 800,000 people have been killed; the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring countries -- into Congo, into Tanzania.
I'm Sergio, I'm a humanitarian, and I want to feed those -- well, I don't want to feed the killers but I want to feed the two million people who are with them, so we're going to go, we're going to set up camps, and we're going to supply humanitarian aid.
But, uh-oh, the killers are within the camps.
Well, I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves.
Let me go door-to-door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation.
And their response, of course, was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that, nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps.
So then you have to make the decision.
Do you turn off the international spigot of life support and risk two million civilian lives?
Or do you continue feeding the civilians, knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps, literally sharpening their knives for future battle?
What do you do?
It's all lesser-evil terrain in these broken places.
Late '90s: nation-building is the cause du jour.
He's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer of first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places.
He's the viceroy. He has to decide on tax policy, on currency, on border patrol, on policing. He has to make all these judgments.
He's a Brazilian in these places. He speaks seven languages.
He's been up to that point in 14 war zones so he's positioned to make better judgments, perhaps, than people who have never done that kind of work.
But nonetheless, he is the cutting edge of our experimentation with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in, again, the world's worst places.
And then after Timor, 9/11 has happened, he's named U.N. Human Rights Commissioner, and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out, what do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations is bowing out of the Geneva Conventions, bowing out of international law? Do you denounce?
Well, if you denounce, you're probably never going to get back in the room.
Maybe you stay reticent. Maybe you try to charm President Bush -- and that's what he did. And in so doing he earned himself, unfortunately, his final and tragic appointment to Iraq -- the one that resulted in his death.
One note on his death, which is so devastating, is that despite predicating the war on Iraq on a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in 9/11, believe it or not, the Bush administration or the invaders did no planning, no pre-war planning, to respond to terrorism.
So Sergio -- this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness, lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue.
Stateless. The guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career.
Like a refugee. Because he represents the U.N.
If you represent everyone, in some ways you represent no one.
You're un-owned.
And what the American -- the most powerful military in the history of mankind was able to muster for his rescue, believe it or not, was literally these heroic two American soldiers went into the shaft. Building was shaking.
One of them had been at 9/11 and lost his buddies on September 11th, and yet went in and risked his life in order to save Sergio.
But all they had was a woman's handbag -- literally one of those basket handbags -- and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters, and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building in the interests of rescuing this person, the person we most need to turn to now, this shepherd, at a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance.
And this was the pulley system. This was what we were able to muster for Sergio.
The good news, for what it's worth, is after Sergio and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N., the military created a search and rescue unit that had the cutting equipment, the shoring wood, the cranes, the things that you would have needed to do the rescue.
But it was too late for Sergio.
I want to wrap up, but I want to close with what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio's life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing, which is how I would have framed the question.
Here's this guy who got a 34-year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with, we as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away?
First, I think, is his relationship to, in fact, evil is something to learn from.
He, over the course of his career, changed a great deal.
He had a lot of flaws, but he was very adaptive.
I think that was his greatest quality.
He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers, he would charge up to people who were violating international law, and he would say, you're violating, this is the U.N. Charter.
Don't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing?
And they would laugh at him because he didn't have the power of states, the power of any military or police.
He just had the rules, he had the norms, and he tried to use them.
And in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in '82, he said to himself and to everybody else, I will never use the word "unacceptable" again.
I will never use it. I will try to make it such, but I will never use that word again.
But he lunged in the opposite direction.
He started, as I mentioned, to get in the room with evil, to not denounce, and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname Serbio, for instance, and even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room.
But by the end of his life, I think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from.
Be in the room, don't be afraid of talking to your adversaries, but don't bracket what happened before you entered the room.
Don't black-box history. Don't check your principles at the door.
And I think that's something that we have to be in the room, whether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy or Reagan and Gorbachev.
All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room.
And it doesn't have to be an act of weakness.
You can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person, that regime, is the problem and that you, the United States, are not the problem.
Second take-away from Sergio's life, briefly.
What I take away, and this in some ways is the most important, he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really, really unusual.
At a micro level, the individuals around him were visible.
He saw them.
At a macro level, he thought, you know, we talk about democracy promotion, but we do it in a way sometimes that's an affront to people's dignity.
We put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we've spent three billion.
It's incredibly important, those people would no longer be alive if the United States, for instance, hadn't spent that money in Darfur, but it's not a way to live.
If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us, and as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries, it would be something of a revolution.
Third point, very briefly. He talked a lot about freedom from fear.
And I recognize there is so much to be afraid of.
There are so many genuine threats in the world.
But what Sergio was talking about is, let's calibrate our relationship to the threat.
Let's not hype the threat; let's actually see it clearly.
We have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps.
We have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.
Let's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats, but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic, of a fear.
In times of fear, for instance, one of the things Sergio used to say is, fear is a bad advisor.
We lunge towards the extremes when we aren't operating and trying to, again, calibrate our relationship to the world around us.
Fourth and final point: he somehow, because he was working in all the world's worst places and all lesser evils, had a humility, of course, and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him.
I mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was.
How Sisyphean this task was of mending, and yet aware of that complexity, humbled by it, he wasn't paralyzed by it.
And we as citizens, as we go through this experience of the kind of, the crisis of confidence, crisis of competence, crisis of legitimacy, I think there's a temptation to pull back from the world and say, ah, Katrina, Iraq -- we don't know what we're doing.
We can't afford to pull back from the world.
It's a question of how to be in the world.
And the lesson, I think, of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned, that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do -- it'll be many decades, probably, before that happens -- but is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change.
We can't rely upon our institutions to do the work of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own without us creating a space for that to happen, for having respect for dignity, and for bringing that combination of humility and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility to our dealings with the rest of the world.
So will evil prevail? Is that the question?
I think the short answer is: no, not unless we let it.
Thank you.

<title>Samantha Power: A complicated hero</title>
<description>Samantha Power tells a story of a complicated hero, Sergio Vieira de Mello. This UN diplomat walked a thin moral line, negotiating with the world's worst dictators to help their people survive crisis. It's a compelling story told with a fiery passion.</description>
<keywords>communication,global issues,morality,politics,war</keywords>

Well after many years working in trade and economics, four years ago, I found myself working on the front lines of human vulnerability.
And I found myself in the places where people are fighting every day to survive and can't even obtain a meal.
This red cup comes from Rwanda from a child named Fabian.
And I carry this around as a symbol, really, of the challenge and also the hope.
Because one cup of food a day changes Fabian's life completely.
But what I'd like to talk about today is the fact that this morning, about a billion people on Earth -- or one out of every seven -- woke up and didn't even know how to fill this cup.
One out of every seven people.
First, I'll ask you: Why should you care?
Why should we care?
For most people, if they think about hunger, they don't have to go far back on their own family history -- maybe in their own lives, or their parents' lives, or their grandparents' lives -- to remember an experience of hunger.
I rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience.
Some are driven by compassion, feel it's perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity.
As Gandhi said, "To a hungry man, a piece of bread is the face of God."
Others worry about peace and security, stability in the world.
We saw the food riots in 2008, after what I call the silent tsunami of hunger swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight.
The destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history.
One of the most fundamental acts of civilization is to ensure people can get enough food.
Others think about Malthusian nightmares.
Will we be able to feed a population that will be nine billion in just a few decades?
This is not a negotiable thing, hunger.
People have to eat.
There's going to be a lot of people.
This is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain.
But I actually came to this issue in a different way.
This is a picture of me and my three children.
In 1987, I was a new mother with my first child and was holding her and feeding her when an image very similar to this came on the television.
And this was yet another famine in Ethiopia.
One two years earlier had killed more than a million people.
But it never struck me as it did that moment, because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby, and she had no milk to nurse.
And the baby's cry really penetrated me, as a mother.
And I thought, there's nothing more haunting than the cry of a child that cannot be returned with food -- the most fundamental expectation of every human being.
And it was at that moment that I just was filled with the challenge and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem.
This isn't one of those rare diseases that we don't have the solution for.
We know how to fix hunger.
A hundred years ago, we didn't.
We actually have the technology and systems.
And I was just struck that this is out of place.
At our time in history, these images are out of place.
Well guess what?
This is last week in northern Kenya.
Yet again, the face of starvation at large scale with more than nine million people wondering if they can make it to the next day.
In fact, what we know now is that every 10 seconds we lose a child to hunger.
This is more than HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.
And we know that the issue is not just production of food.
One of my mentors in life was Norman Borlaug, my hero.
But today I'm going to talk about access to food, because actually this year and last year and during the 2008 food crisis, there was enough food on Earth for everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories.
So why is it that we have a billion people who can't find food?
And I also want to talk about what I call our new burden of knowledge.
In 2008, Lancet compiled all the research and put forward the compelling evidence that if a child in its first thousand days -- from conception to two years old -- does not have adequate nutrition, the damage is irreversible.
Their brains and bodies will be stunted.
And here you see a brain scan of two children -- one who had adequate nutrition, another, neglected and who was deeply malnourished.
And we can see brain volumes up to 40 percent less in these children.
And in this slide you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain don't form.
And what we know now is this has huge impact on economies, which I'll talk about later.
But also the earning potential of these children is cut in half in their lifetime due to the stunting that happens in early years.
So this burden of knowledge drives me.
Because actually we know how to fix it very simply.
And yet, in many places, a third of the children, by the time they're three already are facing a life of hardship due to this.
I'd like to talk about some of the things I've seen on the front lines of hunger, some of the things I've learned in bringing my economic and trade knowledge and my experience in the private sector.
I'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is.
Well first, I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth, breastfeeding.
You may be surprised to know that a child could be saved every 22 seconds if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life.
But in Niger, for example, less than seven percent of the children are breastfed for the first six months of life, exclusively.
In Mauritania, less than three percent.
This is something that can be transformed with knowledge.
This message, this word, can come out that this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business; it's a brilliant way of saving your child's life.
And so today we focus on not just passing out food, but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment, and teaching them about breastfeeding.
The second thing I'd like to talk about: If you were living in a remote village somewhere, your child was limp, and you were in a drought, or you were in floods, or you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet, what would you do?
Do you think you could go to the store and get a choice of power bars, like we can, and pick the right one to match?
Well I find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count.
And I go to those shops, if there are any, or out to the fields to see what they can get, and they cannot obtain the nutrition.
Even if they know what they need to do, it's not available.
And I'm very excited about this, because one thing we're working on is transforming the technologies that are very available in the food industry to be available for traditional crops.
And this is made with chickpeas, dried milk and a host of vitamins, matched to exactly what the brain needs.
It costs 17 cents for us to produce this as, what I call, food for humanity.
We did this with food technologists in India and Pakistan -- really about three of them.
But this is transforming 99 percent of the kids who get this.
One package, 17 cents a day -- their malnutrition is overcome.
So I am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods.
And this is climate-proof.
It doesn't need to be refrigerated, it doesn't need water, which is often lacking.
And these types of technologies, I see, have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutrition, malnutrition out on the front lines.
The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding.
Eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net.
When disaster strikes -- the economy gets blown, people lose a job, floods, war, conflict, bad governance, all of those things -- there is nothing to fall back on.
And usually the institutions -- churches, temples, other things -- do not have the resources to provide a safety net.
What we have found working with the World Bank is that the poor man's safety net, the best investment, is school feeding.
And if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers, you have a transformative effect.
Many kids in the world can't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal.
But when that food is there, it's transformative.
It costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life.
But what is most amazing is the effect on girls.
In countries where girls don't go to school and you offer a meal to girls in school, we see enrollment rates about 50 percent girls and boys.
We see a transformation in attendance by girls.
And there was no argument, because it's incentive.
Families need the help.
And we find that if we keep girls in school later, they'll stay in school until they're 16, and won't get married if there's food in school.
Or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week -- it costs about 50 cents -- will keep a girl in school, and they'll give birth to a healthier child, because the malnutrition is sent generation to generation.
We know that there's boom and bust cycles of hunger.
We know this.
Right now on the Horn of Africa, we've been through this before.
So is this a hopeless cause?
Absolutely not.
I'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope.
Cameroon, northern Cameroon, boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades.
Food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons.
Well two years ago, we decided, let's transform the model of fighting hunger, and instead of giving out the food aid, we put it into food banks.
And we said, listen, during the lean season, take the food out.
You manage, the village manages these warehouses.
And during harvest, put it back with interest, food interest.
So add in five percent, 10 percent more food.
For the past two years, 500 of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid -- they're self-sufficient.
And the food banks are growing.
And they're starting school feeding programs for their children by the people in the village.
But they've never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources.
I love this idea that came from the village level: three keys to unlock that warehouse.
Food is gold there.
And simple ideas can transform the face, not of small areas, of big areas of the world.
I'd like to talk about what I call digital food.
Technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine.
Amartya Sen won his Nobel Prize for saying, "Guess what, famines happen in the presence of food because people have no ability to buy it."
We certainly saw that in 2008.
We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas over last year.
Food can be there and people can't buy it.
Well this picture -- I was in Hebron in a small shop, this shop, where instead of bringing in food, we provide digital food, a card.
It says "bon appetit" in Arabic.
And the women can go in and swipe and get nine food items.
They have to be nutritious, and they have to be locally produced.
And what's happened in the past year alone is the dairy industry -- where this card's used for milk and yogurt and eggs and hummus -- the dairy industry has gone up 30 percent.
The shopkeepers are hiring more people.
It is a win-win-win situation that starts the food economy moving.
We now deliver food in over 30 countries over cell phones, transforming even the presence of refugees in countries, and other ways.
Perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that Bill Gates, Howard Buffett and others have supported boldly, which is to ask the question: What if, instead of looking at the hungry as victims -- and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families -- what if we view them as the solution, as the value chain to fight hunger?
What if from the women in Africa who cannot sell any food -- there's no roads, there's no warehouses, there's not even a tarp to pick the food up with -- what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children elsewhere?
And Purchasing for Progress today is in 21 countries.
And guess what?
In virtually every case, when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market -- if you say, "We will buy 300 metric tons of this.
We'll pick it up. We'll make sure it's stored properly." -- their yields have gone up two-, three-, fourfold and they figure it out, because it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life.
And we're seeing people transform their lives.
Today, food aid, our food aid -- huge engine -- 80 percent of it is bought in the developing world.
Total transformation that can actually transform the very lives that need the food.
Now you'd ask, can this be done at scale?
These are great ideas, village-level ideas.
Well I'd like to talk about Brazil, because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years, when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on Earth right now.
And what I've found is, rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things, they invested in a school feeding program.
And they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity.
And they're doing this at huge scale after President Lula declared his goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day.
And this zero hunger program costs .5 percent of GDP and has lifted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty.
It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil, and it's at scale, and it's creating opportunities.
I've gone out there; I've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this.
Now if we look at the economic imperative here, this isn't just about compassion.
The fact is studies show that the cost of malnutrition and hunger -- the cost to society, the burden it has to bear -- is on average six percent, and in some countries up to 11 percent, of GDP a year.
And if you look at the 36 countries with the highest burden of malnutrition, that's 260 billion lost from a productive economy every year.
Well, the World Bank estimates it would take about 10 billion dollars -- 10.3 -- to address malnutrition in those countries.
You look at the cost-benefit analysis, and my dream is to take this issue, not just from the compassion argument, but to the finance ministers of the world, and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate, affordable nutrition for all of humanity.
The amazing thing I've found is nothing can change on a big scale without the determination of a leader.
When a leader says, "Not under my watch," everything begins to change.
And the world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities to do this.
And the fact that France has put food at the center of the G20 is really important.
Because food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person, nation by nation.
We have to stand together.
And we're seeing nations in Africa.
WFP's been able to leave 30 nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations.
What I would like to offer here is a challenge.
I believe we're living at a time in human history where it's just simply unacceptable that children wake up and don't know where to find a cup of food.
Not only that, transforming hunger is an opportunity, but I think we have to change our mindsets.
I am so honored to be here with some of the world's top innovators and thinkers.
And I would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say, "No more.
No more are we going to accept this."
And we want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stunted, but that exists no more.
Thank you.

<title>Josette Sheeran: Ending hunger now</title>
<description>Josette Sheeran, the head of the UN's World Food Program, talks about why, in a world with enough food for everyone, people still go hungry, still die of starvation, still use food as a weapon of war. Her vision: "Food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person. We have to stand together."</description>

Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean, no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it.
It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden, but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost.
I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us, and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying, but it really should concern you.
It does concern you, as well.
I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child," asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time.
Well, now is that time.
I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind.
Health to the ocean means health for us.
And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.
And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet.
Did I say that? I guess I did.
For me, as a scientist, it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba.
It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter.
I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime.
Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970, when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon.
In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim.
It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down.
It's one of my favorite bathing suits.
Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea.
I led a five-year National Geographic expedition, the Sustainable Seas expeditions, using these little subs.
They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it.
And I'm living proof.
Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea.
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system."
We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it.
The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love; none without water."
Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean.
No blue, no green.
If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it.
Mars comes to mind.
No ocean, no life support system.
I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!"
That's where all the assets are!
And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them.
Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment.
With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea.
No matter where on Earth you live.
Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea.
Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes.
The ocean drives climate and weather, stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry.
Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain, sleet and snow, and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world, maybe in the universe.
No water, no life; no blue, no green.
Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it.
That may have been true 10,000 years ago, and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100, especially in the last 50, we've drawn down the assets, the air, the water, the wildlife that make our lives possible.
New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth.
I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem.
And fortunately, in our time, we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history.
And with knowing comes caring.
And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us.
But first we have to know.
Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously.
But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it?
You did a great job with the land, the dirt.
What about the water?"
Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth.
And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole.
Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below.
To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see.
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands.
We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales.
These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater.
There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale.
We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been.
Imagine that. It's only seven miles, but only two people have been there, 49 years ago.
One-way trips are easy.
We need new deep-diving submarines.
How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration?
We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea.
We can now go to the Arctic.
Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole.
An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century.
That's bad news for the polar bears.
That's bad news for us too.
Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic.
That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton.
Also it's bad news for us.
We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea.
Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets, gear that continues to kill.
We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units.
Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup, undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the water cycle -- our life support system.
We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead.
All of these parts are part of our life support system.
We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more.
Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers, taking everything in their path.
Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path.
The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost.
For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch.
This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea.
This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000.
The highest concentrations are in red.
In my lifetime, imagine, 90 percent of the big fish have been killed.
Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers.
But, there is good news.
Ten percent of the big fish still remain.
There are still some blue whales.
There are still some krill in Antarctica.
There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay.
Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet.
There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around.
But business as usual means that in 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone.
Imagine the ocean without fish.
Imagine what that means to our life support system.
Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too, but the problems are more obvious, and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife.
And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park, the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had.
About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected: safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink, generating oxygen, protecting watersheds.
And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea, National Marine Sanctuaries.
That's another great idea.
The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection.
And you can find them on Google Earth.
The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them.
In the last three years, for example, the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments.
But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally.
Protected areas do rebound, but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass, or 200-year-old orange roughy.
We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens.
Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph.
With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future.
Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance, right now, to get it right.
Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected, but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish.
Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows.
97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected, but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing.
It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble.
The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel -- the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth, filled with luminous creatures, living in dark waters that average two miles deep.
They flash, and sparkle, and glow with their own living light.
There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child.
The next 10 years may be the most important, and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life.
To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power.
We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease.
We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place.
But, nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean.
Our fate and the ocean's are one.
We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above.
A global plan of action with a world conservation union, the IUCN, is underway to protect biodiversity, to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change, on the high seas and in coastal areas, wherever we can identify critical places.
New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see.
The goal is to protect biodiversity, to provide stability and resilience.
We need deep-diving subs, new technologies to explore the ocean.
We need, maybe, an expedition -- a TED at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps.
And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is.
I wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films, expeditions, the web, new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet.
How much?
Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent.
You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?
Whatever it is, a fraction of one percent is not enough.
My wish is a big wish, but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world, and help ensure the survival of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species; that would be us.
For the children of today, for tomorrow's child: as never again, now is the time.
Thank you.

So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack, and all it requires of you is this: that you change your posture for two minutes.
But before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body.
So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller?
Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs, maybe wrapping your ankles.
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.
Sometimes we spread out.
I see you.
So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now.
We're going to come back to that in a few minutes, and I'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit, it could significantly change the way your life unfolds.
So, we're really fascinated with body language, and we're particularly interested in other people's body language.
You know, we're interested in, like, you know — — an awkward interaction, or a smile, or a contemptuous glance, or maybe a very awkward wink, or maybe even something like a handshake.
Here they are arriving at Number 10, and look at this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States. Oh, and here comes the Prime Minister of the — ? No.
Amy Cuddy: So a handshake, or the lack of a handshake, can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks.
Even the BBC and The New York Times.
So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior, or body language -- but we call it nonverbals as social scientists -- it's language, so we think about communication.
When we think about communication, we think about interactions.
So what is your body language communicating to me?
What's mine communicating to you?
And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this. So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language, or other people's body language, on judgments.
And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language.
And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote, who we ask out on a date.
For example, Nalini Ambady, a researcher at Tufts University, shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions, their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued.
So it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent, but do we like that person and how they interacted?
Even more dramatic, Alex Todorov at Princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates' faces in just one second predict 70 percent of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes, and even, let's go digital, emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead to you claim more value from that negotiation.
If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?
So when we think of nonverbals, we think of how we judge others, how they judge us and what the outcomes are.
We tend to forget, though, the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals, and that's ourselves.
We are also influenced by our nonverbals, our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology.
So what nonverbals am I talking about?
I'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice, and I teach at a competitive business school, so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics.
I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance.
And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance?
Well, this is what they are.
So in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding.
So you make yourself big, you stretch out, you take up space, you're basically opening up.
It's about opening up. And this is true across the animal kingdom. It's not just limited to primates.
And humans do the same thing.
So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically, and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment.
And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are.
This expression, which is known as pride, Jessica Tracy has studied. She shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition.
So when they cross the finish line and they've won, it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it.
They do this.
So the arms up in the V, the chin is slightly lifted.
What do we do when we feel powerless? We do exactly the opposite. We close up. We wrap ourselves up.
We make ourselves small. We don't want to bump into the person next to us.
So again, both animals and humans do the same thing.
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power. So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other's nonverbals.
So if someone is being really powerful with us, we tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them.
We do the opposite of them.
So I'm watching this behavior in the classroom, and what do I notice? I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals.
So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas, really coming into the room, they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts, like they really want to occupy space.
When they sit down, they're sort of spread out.
They raise their hands like this.
You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in. As soon they come in, you see it.
You see it on their faces and their bodies, and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny, and they go like this when they raise their hand.
I notice a couple of things about this.
One, you're not going to be surprised.
It seems to be related to gender.
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men.
Women feel chronically less powerful than men, so this is not surprising. But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating, and how well they were participating.
And this is really important in the MBA classroom, because participation counts for half the grade.
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap.
You get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades, and it seems to be partly attributable to participation.
So I started to wonder, you know, okay, so you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating. Is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more?
So my main collaborator Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley, and I really wanted to know, can you fake it till you make it?
Like, can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful?
So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us. There's a lot of evidence.
But our question really was, do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves?
There's some evidence that they do.
So, for example, we smile when we feel happy, but also, when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this, it makes us feel happy.
So it goes both ways. When it comes to power, it also goes both ways. So when you feel powerful, you're more likely to do this, but it's also possible that when you pretend to be powerful, you are more likely to actually feel powerful.
So the second question really was, you know, so we know that our minds change our bodies, but is it also true that our bodies change our minds?
And when I say minds, in the case of the powerful, what am I talking about?
So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings, and in my case, that's hormones. I look at hormones.
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like?
So powerful people tend to be, not surprisingly, more assertive and more confident, more optimistic.
They actually feel that they're going to win even at games of chance.
They also tend to be able to think more abstractly.
So there are a lot of differences. They take more risks.
There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people.
Physiologically, there also are differences on two key hormones: testosterone, which is the dominance hormone, and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.
So what we find is that high-power alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol, and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol.
So what does that mean? When you think about power, people tended to think only about testosterone, because that was about dominance.
But really, power is also about how you react to stress.
So do you want the high-power leader that's dominant, high on testosterone, but really stress reactive?
Probably not, right? You want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant, but not very stress reactive, the person who's laid back.
So we know that in primate hierarchies, if an alpha needs to take over, if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly, within a few days, that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly.
So we have this evidence, both that the body can shape the mind, at least at the facial level, and also that role changes can shape the mind.
So what happens, okay, you take a role change, what happens if you do that at a really minimal level, like this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention?
"For two minutes," you say, "I want you to stand like this, and it's going to make you feel more powerful."
So this is what we did. We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment, and these people adopted, for two minutes, either high-power poses or low-power poses, and I'm just going to show you five of the poses, although they took on only two.
So here's one.
A couple more.
This one has been dubbed the "Wonder Woman" by the media.
Here are a couple more.
So you can be standing or you can be sitting.
And here are the low-power poses.
So you're folding up, you're making yourself small.
This one is very low-power.
When you're touching your neck, you're really protecting yourself.
So this is what happens. They come in, they spit into a vial, we for two minutes say, "You need to do this or this."
They don't look at pictures of the poses. We don't want to prime them with a concept of power. We want them to be feeling power, right? So two minutes they do this.
We then ask them, "How powerful do you feel?" on a series of items, and then we give them an opportunity to gamble, and then we take another saliva sample.
That's it. That's the whole experiment.
So this is what we find. Risk tolerance, which is the gambling, what we find is that when you're in the high-power pose condition, 86 percent of you will gamble.
When you're in the low-power pose condition, only 60 percent, and that's a pretty whopping significant difference.
Here's what we find on testosterone.
From their baseline when they come in, high-power people experience about a 20-percent increase, and low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease.
So again, two minutes, and you get these changes.
Here's what you get on cortisol. High-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease, and the low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase.
So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive, confident and comfortable, or really stress-reactive, and, you know, feeling sort of shut down. And we've all had the feeling, right?
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves, so it's not just others, but it's also ourselves.
Also, our bodies change our minds.
But the next question, of course, is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways?
So this is in the lab. It's this little task, you know, it's just a couple of minutes. Where can you actually apply this? Which we cared about, of course.
And so we think it's really, what matters, I mean, where you want to use this is evaluative situations like social threat situations. Where are you being evaluated, either by your friends? Like for teenagers it's at the lunchroom table.
It could be, you know, for some people it's speaking at a school board meeting. It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview.
We decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview.
So we published these findings, and the media are all over it, and they say, Okay, so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview, right?
You know, so we were of course horrified, and said, Oh my God, no, no, no, that's not what we meant at all.
For numerous reasons, no, no, no, don't do that.
Again, this is not about you talking to other people.
It's you talking to yourself. What do you do before you go into a job interview? You do this.
Right? You're sitting down. You're looking at your iPhone -- or your Android, not trying to leave anyone out.
You are, you know, you're looking at your notes, you're hunching up, making yourself small, when really what you should be doing maybe is this, like, in the bathroom, right? Do that. Find two minutes.
So that's what we want to test. Okay?
So we bring people into a lab, and they do either high- or low-power poses again, they go through a very stressful job interview.
It's five minutes long. They are being recorded.
They're being judged also, and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback, so they look like this. Like, imagine this is the person interviewing you.
So for five minutes, nothing, and this is worse than being heckled.
People hate this. It's what Marianne LaFrance calls "standing in social quicksand."
So this really spikes your cortisol.
So this is the job interview we put them through, because we really wanted to see what happened.
We then have these coders look at these tapes, four of them.
They're blind to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions.
They have no idea who's been posing in what pose, and they end up looking at these sets of tapes, and they say, "Oh, we want to hire these people," -- all the high-power posers -- "we don't want to hire these people.
We also evaluate these people much more positively overall."
But what's driving it? It's not about the content of the speech.
It's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech.
We also, because we rate them on all these variables related to competence, like, how well-structured is the speech? How good is it? What are their qualifications?
No effect on those things. This is what's affected.
These kinds of things. People are bringing their true selves, basically. They're bringing themselves.
They bring their ideas, but as themselves, with no, you know, residue over them.
So this is what's driving the effect, or mediating the effect.
So when I tell people about this, that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior, and our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me, "I don't -- It feels fake." Right?
So I said, fake it till you make it. I don't -- It's not me.
I don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud.
I don't want to feel like an impostor.
I don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to be here.
And that really resonated with me, because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and feeling like I'm not supposed to be here.
When I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident.
I was thrown out of a car, rolled several times.
I was thrown from the car. And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward, and I had been withdrawn from college, and I learned that my I.Q. had dropped by two standard deviations, which was very traumatic.
I knew my I.Q. because I had identified with being smart, and I had been called gifted as a child.
So I'm taken out of college, I keep trying to go back.
They say, "You're not going to finish college.
Just, you know, there are other things for you to do, but that's not going to work out for you."
So I really struggled with this, and I have to say, having your identity taken from you, your core identity, and for me it was being smart, having that taken from you, there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that.
So I felt entirely powerless. I worked and worked and worked, and I got lucky, and worked, and got lucky, and worked.
Eventually I graduated from college.
It took me four years longer than my peers, and I convinced someone, my angel advisor, Susan Fiske, to take me on, and so I ended up at Princeton, and I was like, I am not supposed to be here.
I am an impostor.
And the night before my first-year talk, and the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people. That's it.
I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said, "I'm quitting."
She was like, "You are not quitting, because I took a gamble on you, and you're staying.
You're going to stay, and this is what you're going to do.
You are going to fake it.
You're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do.
You're just going to do it and do it and do it, even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience, until you have this moment where you say, 'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.
Like, I have become this. I am actually doing this.'" So that's what I did. Five years in grad school, a few years, you know, I'm at Northwestern, I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard, I'm not really thinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking, "Not supposed to be here. Not supposed to be here."
So at the end of my first year at Harvard, a student who had not talked in class the entire semester, who I had said, "Look, you've gotta participate or else you're going to fail," came into my office. I really didn't know her at all.
And she said, she came in totally defeated, and she said, "I'm not supposed to be here."
And that was the moment for me. Because two things happened.
One was that I realized, oh my gosh, I don't feel like that anymore. You know.
I don't feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling.
And the second was, she is supposed to be here!
Like, she can fake it, she can become it.
So I was like, "Yes, you are! You are supposed to be here!
And tomorrow you're going to fake it, you're going to make yourself powerful, and, you know, you're gonna — " "And you're going to go into the classroom, and you are going to give the best comment ever."
You know? And she gave the best comment ever, and people turned around and they were like, oh my God, I didn't even notice her sitting there, you know?
She comes back to me months later, and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it, she had actually faked it till she became it.
So she had changed.
And so I want to say to you, don't fake it till you make it.
Fake it till you become it. You know? It's not — Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize.
The last thing I'm going to leave you with is this.
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.
So this is two minutes.
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
Before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation, for two minutes, try doing this, in the elevator, in a bathroom stall, at your desk behind closed doors.
That's what you want to do. Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation.
Get your testosterone up. Get your cortisol down.
Don't leave that situation feeling like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.
Leave that situation feeling like, oh, I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am.
So I want to ask you first, you know, both to try power posing, and also I want to ask you to share the science, because this is simple.
I don't have ego involved in this.
Give it away. Share it with people, because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power. Give it to them because they can do it in private.
They need their bodies, privacy and two minutes, and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life.
Thank you.

<title>Amy Cuddy: Your body language shapes who you are</title>
<description>Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see ourselves. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy shows how "power posing" -- standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don't feel confident -- can affect testosterone and cortisol levels in the brain, and might even have an impact on our chances for success.</description>

I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin, from when I was 12 years old.
My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater -- at least I thought it was beautiful.
And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach, and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest, that were also fuzzy.
And I wore it whenever I could, thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.
Until one day in ninth grade, when I was standing with a number of the football players.
And my body had clearly changed, and Matt Mussolina, who was undeniably my nemesis in high school, said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips, but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz.
And I was so humiliated and mortified that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater.
We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously, my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again.
Fast forward -- 11 years later, I'm a 25-year-old kid.
I'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes, when I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy -- 11 years old -- running toward me, wearing my sweater.
And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible.
But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of course scaring the living bejesus out of him -- grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater.
I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this Earth.
We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know.
I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be.
That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia, and moved its way into the larger industry, which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia.
Which was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing.
And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda, it destroyed the local retailing industry.
Not to say that it shouldn't have, but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses.
So, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986, where I was doing two things.
I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers.
We were called the "Bad News Bears," and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali, which was not hard because there were no snacks before us.
And because we had a good business model, we actually did it, and I watched these women transform on a micro-level.
But at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank, and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen, which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks, which now is a worldwide movement -- you talk about a meme -- but then it was quite new, especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade.
We got a lot of things right.
We focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game.
The women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses, earn more income so they could take care of their families better.
What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us, with the confluence of fear, ethnic strife and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda, that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid.
The genocide happened in 1994, seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream.
And the good news was that the institution, the banking institution, lasted.
In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country.
The bakery was completely wiped out, but the lessons for me were that accountability counts -- got to build things with people on the ground, using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say, the incentives matter.
Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.
So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything that was happening in the world, that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist, on the one hand I absolutely agree with him, and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 -- that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono and Bob Geldof -- the world is talking about global poverty; the world is talking about Africa in ways I have never seen in my life.
It's thrilling.
And at the same time, what keeps me up at night is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 -- 50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa, 40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory, as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.
And in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one, celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution, all about the how-to.
And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today, it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history, is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor, in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable.
If we do that, we really can make poverty history.
And it was that -- that whole philosophy -- that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called "Acumen Fund," which is trying to build some mini-blueprints for how we might do that in water, health and housing in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt.
And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples, so you can see what it is that we're doing.
But before I do this -- and this is another one of my pet peeves -- I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are.
Because we too often talk about them as these strong, huge masses of people yearning to be free, when in fact, it's quite an amazing story.
On a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.
That's who we talk about when we think about "the poor."
If you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth, and yet most of these people go invisible.
Where we typically work, there's people making between one and three dollars a day.
Who are these people?
They are farmers and factory workers.
They work in government offices. They're drivers.
They are domestics.
They typically pay for critical goods and services like water, like healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times what their middleclass counterparts pay -- certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi.
The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions, if you give them that opportunity.
So, two examples.
One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers, most of whom make less than two dollars a day.
Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched.
You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar.
This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.
What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches, and figure out how to do a drip irrigation, which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock.
But previously it's only been created for large-scale farms, so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre.
A couple of principles: build small.
Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor.
This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit when they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to with a corrugated iron roof.
After one harvest, they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre.
A couple of years later, I meet them.
They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India, and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house.
And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes.
Something I truly believe.
You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets, and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life.
Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.
300 to 500 million cases are reported.
It's estimated that Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease.
Five dollars can save a life.
We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars -- why can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people?
The question, though, is not "Why can't we?"
The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves?
A lot of hurdles.
One: production is too low. Two: price is too high.
Three: this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located.
Distribution is a nightmare, but not impossible.
We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these long-lasting, five-year nets.
Here are just some pictures of the factory.
Today, three years later, the company has employed another thousand women.
It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.
It's the largest company in Tanzania.
The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets, three million by the end of the year.
We hope to have seven million at the end of next year.
So the production side is working.
On the distribution side, though, as a world, we have a lot of work to do.
Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N., and then given primarily to people around Africa.
We're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa: people.
Their women.
And so I want you to meet Jacqueline, my namesake, 21 years old.
If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania, I'm telling you, she could run Wall Street.
She runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house.
She makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund, and told me she is not marrying nor having children until these things are completed.
And so, when I told her about our idea -- that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States, and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others -- she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up.
We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies, and quickly did a prototyping on this, and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives.
She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece, despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one, and we learned a lot about how you sell things.
Not coming in with our own notions, because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end.
First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty.
These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house.
Children can sleep through the night; the house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window.
And we've started making curtains, and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status -- that you care about your children.
Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives.
A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor.
I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity to make poverty history.
To do it right, we have to build business models that matter, that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians, people all over the developing world who fit in this category, to do it themselves.
Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement.
It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts, that they want to make their own decisions; they want to solve their own problems; and that by engaging with them, not only do we create much more dignity for them, but for us as well.
And so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have -- to make poverty history -- by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us-and-them world, and realizing that it's about all of us, and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.
Thank you.

So when I do my job, people hate me.
In fact, the better I do my job, the more people hate me.
And no, I'm not a meter maid, and I'm not an undertaker.
I am a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News.
So y'all heard that, right? Just to make sure, right?
I am a gay talking head on Fox News.
I am going to tell you how I do it and the most important thing I've learned.
So I go on television.
I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in, in some cases, who don't want me and people like me to even exist.
It's sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids, with a live television audience of millions.
It's totally almost just like that.
And that's just on air.
The hate mail I get is unbelievable.
Last week alone, I got 238 pieces of nasty email and more hate tweets than I can even count.
I was called an idiot, a traitor, a scourge, a cunt, and an ugly man, and that was just in one email.
So what have I realized, being on the receiving end of all this ugliness?
Well, my biggest takeaway is that for decades, we've been focused on political correctness, but what matters more is emotional correctness.
Let me give you a small example.
I don't care if you call me a dyke. I really don't.
I care about two things.
One, I care that you spell it right.
Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E.
You'd totally be surprised.
And second, I don't care about the word, I care about how you use it.
Are you being friendly? Are you just being naive?
Or do you really want to hurt me personally?
Emotional correctness is the tone, the feeling, how we say what we say, the respect and compassion we show one another.
And what I've realized is that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.
Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct.
So when I first went to go work at Fox News, true confession, I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle-dragging.
That, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct.
But liberals on my side, we can be self-righteous, we can be condescending, we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree with us.
In other words, we can be politically right but emotionally wrong.
And incidentally, that means that people don't like us. Right?
Now here's the kicker.
Conservatives are really nice.
I mean, not all of them, and not the ones who send me hate mail, but you would be surprised.
Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met.
He spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates, and I know that if I ever had a problem, he would do anything he could to help.
Now, I think Sean Hannity is 99 percent politically wrong, but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive, and that's why people listen to him.
Because you can't get anyone to agree with you if they don't even listen to you first.
We spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements, and if we can start to find compassion for one another, then we have a shot at building common ground.
It actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here, but when you try to put it in practice, it's really powerful.
So someone who says they hate immigrants, I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they've always known.
Or someone who says they don't like teachers' unions, I bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter, and they're just looking for someone to blame.
Our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us.
That is emotional correctness.
I'm not saying it's easy.
An average of, like, 5.6 times per day I have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities.
This whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political-spiritual practice for me, and I ain't the Dalai Lama.
I'm not perfect, but what I am is optimistic, because I don't just get hate mail.
I get a lot of really nice letters, lots of them.
And one of my all-time favorites begins, "I am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic, but I'm a big fan of you as a person."
Now this guy doesn't agree with me, yet.
But he's listening, not because of what I said, but because of how I said it, and somehow, even though we've never met, we've managed to form a connection.
That's emotional correctness, and that's how we start the conversations that really lead to change.
Thank you.

So I thought, "I will talk about death."
Seemed to be the passion today.
Actually, it's not about death.
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.
That's what I want to talk about.
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, "Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."
And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer.
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook.
In the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvement, quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.
After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.
Handwriting is a disappearing art.
I'm all for email and thinking while typing, but why give up old habits for new?
Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?
There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug.
But too late.
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him.
So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one.
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book, a soul-searching letter.
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes.
So what do I plan to leave for my son?
I collect autograph books, and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them -- and CDs too, Tracy.
I plan to publish my own notebook.
As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire, I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.
I have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book, and leave that published book for my son.
I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation.
And those linguists, please pardon the grammar, because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.
I took it out for the first time to come here.
"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle, boundless energy confined in the bottle, forcing me to deal with reality, forcing me to deal with being grown up.
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong, but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters, craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me.
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, to live again and to love again."
Thank you.

I would like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs, but not the cyborgs that you think.
You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator, but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices.
So what's a good definition for cyborg?
Well, traditional definition is "an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments."
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel, because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.
People aren't supposed to be there.
But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next.
So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology.
Somebody goes to another country, says, "How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are, how curious their culture is."
And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it, and we think it's very exotic.
Well, what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species.
I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said, "Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens, and look at these fascinating cultures, and look at these curious rituals that everybody's doing around this technology.
They're clicking on things and staring at screens."
Now there's a reason why I study this, versus traditional anthropology.
And the reason is that tool use, in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years, everything has been a physical modification of self.
It has helped us to extend our physical selves, go faster, hit things harder, and there's been a limit on that.
But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self, but an extension of the mental self, and because of that, we're able to travel faster, communicate differently.
And the other thing that happens is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.
We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier, and then we can take anything out.
What does the inside of your computer actually look like?
Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time.
And if you actually lose that information, it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind, that you suddenly feel like something's missing, except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.
The other thing that happens is that you have a second self.
Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online, and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there.
And so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open, which is basically your Facebook wall, so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night -- because it's very much the equivalent.
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.
You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life.
So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed, you have to learn to do that for your digital self.
And the problem is that a lot of people now, especially adolescents, have to go through two adolescences.
They have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward, and then they go through their second self's adolescence, and that's even more awkward because there's an actual history of what they've gone through online.
And anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now, and so it's very awkward, and it's very difficult for them to do those things.
So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say, "I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future."
And I said, "Great."
And he said one day, "What's the shortest distance between two points?"
And I said, "Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday."
I thought I was very clever.
He said, "No, no, no. Here's a better way."
He took a piece of paper, drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched.
And he said, "That is the shortest distance between two points."
And I said, "Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?"
He said, "Well, you just bend time and space, it takes an awful lot of energy, and that's just how you do it."
And I said, "I want to do that."
And he said, "Well, okay."
And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years, I was thinking at night, "I want to be the first person to create a wormhole, to make things accelerate faster.
And I want to make a time machine."
I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders.
But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works.
It gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans.
So I started studying anthropology.
And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones, I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.
They weren't physically transporting themselves; they were mentally transporting themselves.
They would click on a button, and they would be connected as A to B immediately.
And I thought, "Oh, wow. I found it. This is great."
So over time, time and space have compressed because of this.
You can stand on one side of the world, whisper something and be heard on the other.
One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time.
And because of that, you start to dig around for your external memories -- where did you leave them?
So now we're all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we've lost on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets.
And that incites a sort of panic architecture -- "Oh no, where's this thing?"
We're all "I Love Lucy" on a great assembly line of information, and we can't keep up.
And so what happens is, when we bring all that into the social space, we end up checking our phones all the time.
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy.
It's not that we're always connected to everybody, but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone, the room would be very crowded.
These are the people that you have access to right now, in general -- all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this.
One I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore, and that they aren't slowing down and stopping, being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces, paleontology and panic architecture.
They're not just sitting there.
And really, when you have no external input, that is a time when there is a creation of self, when you can do long-term planning, when you can try and figure out who you really are.
And then, once you do that, you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way, instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in -- and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this.
And so this is very important.
I'm really worried that, especially kids today, they're not going to be dealing with this down-time, that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture, and that everything comes to them, and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.
So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.
It has its own external prosthetic devices, and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other.
But when you actually visualize it, all the connections that we're doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the Internet -- it doesn't look technological.
It actually looks very organic.
This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we've connected in this way.
And it's not that machines are taking over.
It's that they're helping us to be more human, helping us to connect with each other.
The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives.
And really, it ends up being more human than technology, because we're co-creating each other all the time.
And so this is the important point that I like to study: that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection -- it's just done in a different way.
We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography.
So that's why I study cyborg anthropology.
Thank you.

Fifteen years ago, it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life.
Back then, 15 years ago, we didn't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and track development across the lifespan.
In the past decade or so, mainly due to advances in brain imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages, and to track changes in brain structure and brain function, so we use structural MRI if you'd like to take a snapshot, a photograph, at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain, and we can ask questions like, how much gray matter does the brain contain, and how does that change with age?
And we also use functional MRI, called fMRI, to take a video, a movie, of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something.
So many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research, and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops, and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood, and instead, the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the '20s and '30s.
So adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological, hormonal, physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable, independent role in society.
It can go on a long time.
One of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex.
So this is a model of the human brain, and this is prefrontal cortex, right at the front.
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.
It's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions, things like decision-making, planning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year, inhibiting inappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid.
It's also involved in social interaction, understanding other people, and self-awareness.
So MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence.
So if you look at gray matter volume, for example, gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years increases during childhood, which is what you can see on this graph. It peaks in early adolescence.
The arrows indicate peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls, and that's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average, and then during adolescence, there's a significant decline in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex.
Now that might sound bad, but actually this is a really important developmental process, because gray matter contains cell bodies and connections between cells, the synapses, and this decline in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning, the elimination of unwanted synapses.
This is a really important process. It's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in, and the synapses that are being used are strengthened, and synapses that aren't being used in that particular environment are pruned away.
You can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush.
You prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining, important branches, can grow stronger, and this process, which effectively fine-tunes brain tissue according to the species-specific environment, is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions during the period of human adolescence.
So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age.
So I'll just give you an example from my lab.
So in my lab, we're interested in the social brain, that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people.
So I like to show a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work.
So this is a soccer game.
Michael Owen has just missed a goal, and he's lying on the ground, and the first aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic and instinctive social emotional responses are, so within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal, everyone is doing the same thing with their arms and the same thing with their face, even Michael Owen as he slides along the grass, is doing the same thing with his arms, and presumably has a similar facial expression, and the only people who don't are the guys in yellow at the back — — and I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium, and they're doing another social emotional response that we all instantly recognize, and that's the second aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates, how good we are at reading other people's behavior, their actions, their gestures, their facial expressions, in terms of their underlying emotions and mental states.
So you don't have to ask any of these guys.
You have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling and thinking at this precise moment in time.
So that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab.
So in my lab, we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan, we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people, their minds, their mental states, their emotions, and one of the findings that we've found several times now, as have other labs around the world, is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex, which is shown in blue on the slide, and it's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex in the midline of your head.
This region is more active in adolescents when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults, and this is actually a meta-analysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world, and they all show the same thing, that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases during the period of adolescence.
And we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach, a different cognitive strategy, to make social decisions, and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavioral task, and I'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab.
So imagine that you're the participant in one of our experiments. You come into the lab, you see this computerized task.
In this task, you see a set of shelves.
Now, there are objects on these shelves, on some of them, and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set of shelves, and there are some objects that he can't see.
They're occluded, from his point of view, with a kind of gray piece of wood.
This is the same set of shelves from his point of view.
Notice that there are only some objects that he can see, whereas there are many more objects that you can see.
Now your task is to move objects around.
The director, standing behind the set of shelves, is going to direct you to move objects around, but remember, he's not going to ask you to move objects that he can't see. This introduces a really interesting condition whereby there's a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director's perspective.
So imagine he tells you to move the top truck left.
There are three trucks there. You're going to instinctively go for the white truck, because that's the top truck from your perspective, but then you have to remember, "Oh, he can't see that truck, so he must mean me to move the blue truck," which is the top truck from his perspective. Now believe it or not, normal, healthy, intelligent adults like you make errors about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial.
They move the white truck instead of the blue truck.
So we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults, and we also have a control condition where there's no director and instead we give people a rule.
We tell them, okay, we're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there's no director. Instead you've got to ignore objects with the dark gray background.
You'll see that this is exactly the same condition, only in the no-director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule, whereas in the director condition, they have to remember to take into account the director's perspective in order to guide their ongoing behavior.
Okay, so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did, this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood, and what you're going to see is the percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions, so the gray is the director condition, and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent of the time, whereas they make far fewer errors when there's no director present, when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background.
Developmentally, these two conditions develop in exactly the same way. Between late childhood and mid-adolescence, there's an improvement, in other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials, in both of these conditions.
But it's when you compare the last two groups, the mid-adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting, because there, there is no continued improvement in the no-director condition.
In other words, everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast, if you look at the last two gray bars, there's still a significant improvement in the director condition between mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior, which is something, by the way, that we do in everyday life all the time, is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence.
So if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you sometimes think they have problems taking other people's perspectives, you're right. They do. And this is why.
So we sometimes laugh about teenagers.
They're parodied, sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage behavior. They take risks, they're sometimes moody, they're very self-conscious.
I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine who said that the thing he noticed most about his teenage daughters before and after puberty was their level of embarrassment in front of him.
So, he said, "Before puberty, if my two daughters were messing around in a shop, I'd say, 'Hey, stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song,' and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing their favorite song. After puberty, that became the threat.
The very notion of their dad singing in public was enough to make them behave.
So people often ask, "Well, is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon?
Is it something we've invented recently in the West?"
And actually, the answer is probably not. There are lots of descriptions of adolescence in history that sound very similar to the descriptions we use today.
So there's a famous quote by Shakespeare from "The Winter's Tale" where he describes adolescence as follows: "I would there were no age between ten and three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest; for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting."
He then goes on to say, "Having said that, would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt in this weather?"
So almost 400 years ago, Shakespeare was portraying adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we portray them in today, but today we try to understand their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain.
So for example, take risk-taking. We know that adolescents have a tendency to take risks. They do.
They take more risks than children or adults, and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they're with their friends. There's an important drive to become independent from one's parents and to impress one's friends in adolescence.
But now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system, so I'm going to show you the limbic system in red in the slide behind me, and also on this brain.
So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain, and it's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things, including taking risks.
It gives you the kick out of taking risks.
And this region, the regions within the limbic system, have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults, and at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex, which you can see in blue in the slide here, which stops us taking excessive risks, is still very much in development in adolescents.
So brain research has shown that the adolescent brain undergoes really quite profound development, and this has implications for education, for rehabilitation, and intervention. The environment, including teaching, can and does shape the developing adolescent brain, and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been routinely educating teenagers in the West.
All four of my grandparents, for example, left school in their early adolescence. They had no choice.
And that's still the case for many, many teenagers around the world today. Forty percent of teenagers don't have access to secondary school education.
And yet, this is a period of life where the brain is particularly adaptable and malleable.
It's a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity.
So what's sometimes seen as the problem with adolescents — heightened risk-taking, poor impulse control, self-consciousness — shouldn't be stigmatized.
It actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education

That's Europe." But, yeah.
It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.
Now what I do is I'm an economist, and I actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company, the industry and the nation, and I work with policymakers worldwide, especially in the European Commission, but recently also in interesting places like China, and I can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues: Where are the European Googles?
What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model, which they understand is different from this old economy growth model?
And what is interesting is that often, even if we're in the 21st century, we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state.
It's talked about in these modern ways, but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley, the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms, the private initiative, whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that's actually able to provide that high-risk finance to these innovative companies, the gazelles as we often call them, which traditional banks are scared of, or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions, their products, to the market and actually get over this really scary Death Valley period in which many companies instead fail.
But what really interests me, especially nowadays and because of what's happening politically around the world, is the language that's used, the narrative, the discourse, the images, the actual words.
So we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it's able to think out of the box.
They are more dynamic.
Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford, where he said to be innovative, you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.
Right? So these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys, right?
And in places like Europe, it might be more equitable, we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S., but the problem is this damn public sector.
It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could.
And even really respectable newspapers, some that I'm actually subscribed to, the words they use are, you know, the state as this Leviathan. Right?
This monster with big tentacles.
They're very explicit in these editorials.
They say, "You know, the state, it's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution, but you know what, what is the next big revolution We all hope it might be something green, or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen," they say -- this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution -- they say, "the state, just stick to the basics, right?
Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools.
Even fund the basic research, because this is popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good which private companies don't want to invest in, do that, but you know what?
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries."
They're often called garage tinkerers, because some of them actually did some things in garages, even though that's partly a myth.
And so what I want to do with you in, oh God, only 10 minutes, is to really think again this juxtaposition, because it actually has massive, massive implications beyond innovation policy, which just happens to be the area that I often talk with with policymakers.
It has huge implications, even with this whole notion that we have on where, when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which, of course, as we know, are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition.
Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.
So these kind of words are constantly, these juxtapositions come up everywhere, not just with innovation policy.
And so to think again, there's no reason that you should believe me, so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone.
Ask who actually funded the really cool, revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box things in the iPhone.
What actually makes your phone a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?
So the Internet, which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world; GPS, where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world; the touchscreen display, which makes it also a really easy-to-use phone for anybody.
These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone, and they're all government-funded.
And the point is that the Internet was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.
GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.
Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA.
The touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.
Now, you might be thinking, "Well, she's just said the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot," but what's really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department.
So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally very interested in because I've actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth, is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits, because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental.
So the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs, whereas the slight variations of existing drugs -- Viagra, different color, different dosage -- are the less revolutionary ones.
And it turns out that a full 75 percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring, Kafkian public sector labs.
This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.
They do. They spend on the marketing part.
They spend on the D part of R&amp;D.
They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock, which is quite problematic.
In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on R&amp;D, but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day I'd be fascinated to tell you about.
Now, what's interesting in all of this is the state, in all these examples, was doing so much more than just fixing market failures.
It was actually shaping and creating markets.
It was funding not only the basic research, which again is a typical public good, but even the applied research.
It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist.
So these SBIR and SDTR programs, which give small companies early-stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital, but also have become increasingly important.
Why? Because, as many of us know, V.C. is actually quite short-term.
They want their returns in three to five years.
Innovation takes a much longer time than that, 15 to 20 years.
And so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?
Who's actually funding the hard stuff?
Of course, it's not just the state.
The private sector does a lot.
But the narrative that we've always been told is the state is important for the basics, but not really providing that sort of high-risk, revolutionary thinking out of the box.
In all these sectors, from funding the Internet to doing the spending, but also the envisioning, the strategic vision, for these investments, it was actually coming within the state.
The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology, came from within government.
And so there's huge implications of this.
First of all, of course I'm not someone, this old-fashioned person, market versus state.
What we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.
But the point is, by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually -- pffff -- a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan, I think we've actually really stunted the possibility to build these public-private partnerships in a really dynamic way.
Even the words that we often use to justify the "P" part, the public part -- well, they're both P's -- with public-private partnerships is in terms of de-risking.
What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you, and there's many more, which myself and other colleagues have been looking at, is doing much more than de-risking.
It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.
It's actually been the one thinking out of the box.
But also, I'm sure you all have had experience with local, regional, national governments, and you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafkian bureaucrat, I've met him."
That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.
Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant, boring, it's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way.
So what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations.
DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri, actually thought really hard about this, how to welcome failure, because you will fail.
You will fail when you innovative.
One out of 10 experiments has any success.
And the V.C. guys know this, and they're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success.
And this brings me, actually, probably, to the biggest implication, and this has huge implications beyond innovation.
If the state is more than just a market fixer, if it actually is a market shaper, and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk, what happened to the reward?
We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course, the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship, and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait, to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds, that whole risk-reward thing.
Well, where's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?
The Internet was crazy.
It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive.
You had to be completely nuts to do it, and luckily, they were.
Now, we don't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker.
And the problem is that economists often think, well, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax.
You know, the companies will pay tax, the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism.
Well, unfortunately, that's not true.
Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.
Globalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.
Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.
I mean, one can take a position on that.
But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state -- Apple's a great example.
They even got the first -- well, not the first, but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company, through this SBIC program, which predated the SBIR program, as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.
And yet we know they legally, as many other companies, pay very little tax back.
So what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism that's much more direct than tax. Why not?
It could happen perhaps through equity.
This, by the way, in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically, countries like Finland in Scandinavia, but also in China and Brazil, they're retaining equity in these investments.
Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money, it's a public funding agency in Finland, which then funded the next round of Nokias.
The Brazilian Development Bank, which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology, they just announced a 56 billion program for the future on this, is retaining equity in these investments.
So to put it provocatively, had the U.S. government thought about this, and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund, you can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent of the profits from what the Internet produced had come back to that innovation fund, there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology.
Instead, many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained.
But perhaps even more important, we heard before about the one percent, the 99 percent.
If the state is thought about in this more strategic way, as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism, because that's what we're talking about, right?
Who are the different players in creating value in the economy, and is the state's role, has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?
If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back, it might just be that in the next round, and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green, that that period of growth will not only be smart, innovation-led, not only green, but also more inclusive, so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley can actually also benefit from that growth, because they have not.
Thank you.

<title>Mariana Mazzucato: Government -- investor, risk-taker, innovator</title>
<description>Why doesn't the government just get out of the way and let the private sector -- the "real revolutionaries" -- innovate? It's rhetoric you hear everywhere, and Mariana Mazzucato wants to dispel it. In an energetic talk, she shows how the state -- which many see as a slow, hunkering behemoth -- is really one of our most exciting risk-takers and market-shapers.</description>

This may sound strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea: modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together.
Very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world.
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us, buildings, bridges, one brick at a time.
Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time.
Almost a hundred years later in 1947, LEGO came up with this.
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.
And in a few short years, LEGO bricks took place in every household.
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.
LEGO made it accessible.
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world, and made it into the building block of our imagination.
Meanwhile the exact same year, at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced, the next building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to build much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.
But there's a main difference: The transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't accept this, that the building block of our time is reserved for experts, so I decided to change that.
Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started developing littleBits.
Let me show you how they work.
LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function.
They're pre-engineered to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets.
So you can't put them the wrong way.
The bricks are color-coded.
Green is output, blue is power, pink is input and orange is wire.
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.
You put a blue to a green, you can make light.
You can put a knob in between and now you've made a little dimmer.
Switch out the knob for a pulse module, which is here, and now you've made a little blinker.
Add this buzzer for some extra punch and you've created a noise machine.
I'm going to stop that.
So beyond simple play, littleBits are actually pretty powerful.
Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder, littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
So to make this blink faster or slower, you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind littleBits is that it's a growing library.
We want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-to-use brick.
Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors -- everything should be accessible.
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at schools.
For example, how a nightlight works, or why an elevator door stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.
So for example, we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material.
Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles, we have Geordie making ...
A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something."
Here's an example of a project they made, a motion-activated confetti canon ball.
But wait, this is actually my favorite project.
It's a lobster made of playdough that's afraid of the dark.
To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material, electronics became just another material.
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.
So littleBits is open-source.
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.
We want to encourage a world of creators, of inventors, of contributors, because this world that we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So go ahead and start inventing.
Thank you.

Who are we?
That is the big question.
And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained, super-intelligent ape.
This could be us.
We belong to the family called the Hominidae.
We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens, and it's important to remember that, in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth.
We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today.
And that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times.
We're one species out of approximately, or let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years.
But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.
And it's important to remember that, because the bonobos are so human, and they share 99 percent of their genes with us.
And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.
It's important to remember that we evolved.
Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people, but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.
We have a common past, and we have a common future.
And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today.
And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity, and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family, as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.
And this is how we look for them.
A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa, looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.
And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.
I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture, but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw, of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.
It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people, to begin to piece together our past.
We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.
When we find a fossil, we mark it.
Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS.
We mark it with a GPS fix, and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen, so we could essentially put it back on the surface, exactly where we found it.
And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.
When we then find something very important, like the bones of a human ancestor, we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly, using dental picks and fine paintbrushes.
And all the sediment is then put through these screens, and where we go again through it very carefully, looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.
And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only, or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.
And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors.
And it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother.
Not many people can say that.
But now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.
I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa, it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.
Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.
It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden, or runs down to Lake Malawi.
And the Rift Valley is a depression.
It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin, carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.
If you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried.
You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface.
And then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you.
OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors, because it's incredibly difficult, A, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved, and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.
And we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains, and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.
So, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country, Kenya.
And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there.
Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin, which represents some 20,000 square miles.
That's a huge job that we've got on our hands.
Two million years ago at Lake Turkana, Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors, actually lived in this region.
You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north. But, essentially, two million years ago, Homo erectus, up in the far right corner, lived alongside three other species of human ancestor.
And here is a skull of a Homo erectus, which I just pulled off the shelf there.
But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.
In fact, if you go back in time, it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.
Where did these things come from?
That's what we're still trying to find answers to, and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.
Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana.
But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya, essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains.
And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough, fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.
And we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.
But when I was 12, as I was in this picture, a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side, when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.
I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well, because I was the same age that he was when he died.
And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.
His brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.
He was very able to use stones effectively as tools.
And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here, actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.
He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller, members of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.
Unfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp and couldn't get out.
Essentially, his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved.
And he remained there until 1.6 million years later, when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu, walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.
It's actually this little piece up here on the top.
Well, an excavation was begun immediately, and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment.
And what was so fun about it was this: the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree, and fairly recently the tree had grown up, but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside, and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this, holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.
We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones, the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones, things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.
It was truly exciting.
He had a body very similar to our own, and he was on the threshold of becoming human.
Well, shortly afterwards, members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa, and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.
So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe.
Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned, from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.
But also, surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia, where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated, and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.
But they lived only 18,000 years ago, and that is truly extraordinary to think about.
Just to put this in terms of generations, because people do find it hard to think of time, Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.
We evolved essentially from an African stock.
Again, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.
And we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.
And until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes shared the planet Earth.
The question now is, well, who are we?
We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species, with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.
For the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.
We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.
Is this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?
And what is it that really makes us us?
I think it's our collective intelligence.
It's our ability to write things down, our language and our consciousness.
From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones, we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels: we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome; and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.
And we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world, from extraordinary places.
Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya, we can talk to people about what we're doing.
As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us, we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet.
Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth, if you look at the fossil record, for about, on average, a million years at a time.
We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species, yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.
And last year, our population grew by 80 million.
I mean, these are extraordinary numbers.
You can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.
But what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth.
We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today.
But we have to control our numbers, because we can't really hold it together as a species.
My father so appropriately put it, that "We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species."
Can we hold it together?
It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.
We all have an African origin.
We have a common past and we share a common future.
Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.
We're sitting on the edge of a precipice, and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today.
We could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.
But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?
Well, to end on a very positive note, I think evolutionarily speaking, this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.
I'll leave it at that, thank you very much.

Life is about opportunities, creating them and embracing them, and for me, that was the Olympic dream.
That's what defined me. That was my bliss.
As a cross-country skier and member of the Australian ski team, headed towards the Winter Olympics, I was on a training bike ride with my fellow teammates.
the spectacular Blue Mountains west of Sydney, it was the perfect autumn day: sunshine, the smell of eucalypt and a dream.
Life was good.
We'd been on our bikes for around five and half hours when we got to the part of the ride that I loved, and that was the hills, because I loved the hills.
And I got up off the seat of my bike, and I started pumping my legs, and as I sucked in the cold mountain air, I could feel it burning my lungs, and I looked up to see the sun shining in my face.
And then everything went black.
Where was I? What was happening?
My body was consumed by pain.
I'd been hit by a speeding utility truck with only 10 minutes to go on the bike ride.
I was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in Sydney.
I had extensive and life-threatening injuries.
I'd broken my neck and my back in six places.
I broke five ribs on my left side.
I broke my right arm. I broke my collarbone.
I broke some bones in my feet.
My whole right side was ripped open, filled with gravel.
My head was cut open across the front, lifted back, exposing the skull underneath.
I had head injures. I had internal injuries.
I had massive blood loss. In fact, I lost about five liters of blood, which is all someone my size would actually hold.
By the time the helicopter arrived at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney, my blood pressure was 40 over nothing.
I was having a really bad day.
For over 10 days, I drifted between two dimensions.
I had an awareness of being in my body, but also being out of my body, somewhere else, watching from above as if it was happening to someone else.
Why would I want to go back to a body that was so broken?
But this voice kept calling me: "Come on, stay with me."
"No. It's too hard."
"Come on. This is our opportunity."
"No. That body is broken. It can no longer serve me."
"Come on. Stay with me. We can do it. We can do it together."
I was at a crossroads.
I knew if I didn't return to my body, I'd have to leave this world forever.
It was the fight of my life.
After 10 days, I made the decision to return to my body, and the internal bleeding stopped.
The next concern was whether I would walk again, because I was paralyzed from the waist down.
They said to my parents, the neck break was a stable fracture, but the back was completely crushed.
The vertebra at L1 was like you'd dropped a peanut, stepped on it, smashed it into thousands of pieces.
They'd have to operate.
They went in. They put me on a beanbag. They cut me, literally cut me in half, I have a scar that wraps around my entire body.
They picked as much broken bone as they could that had lodged in my spinal cord.
They took out two of my broken ribs, and they rebuilt my back, L1, they rebuilt it, they took out another broken rib, they fused T12, L1 and L2 together.
Then they stitched me up. They took an entire hour to stitch me up.
I woke up in intensive care, and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success because at that stage I had a little bit of movement in one of my big toes, and I thought, "Great, because I'm going to the Olympics!"
I had no idea. That's the sort of thing that happens to someone else, not me, surely.
But then the doctor came over to me, and she said, "Janine, the operation was a success, and we've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could, but the damage is permanent.
The central nervous system nerves, there is no cure.
You're what we call a partial paraplegic, and you'll have all of the injuries that go along with that.
You have no feeling from the waist down, and at most, you might get 10- or 20-percent return.
You'll have internal injuries for the rest of your life.
You'll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life.
And if you walk again, it will be with calipers and a walking frame."
And then she said, "Janine, you'll have to rethink everything you do in your life, because you're never going to be able to do the things you did before."
I tried to grasp what she was saying.
I was an athlete. That's all I knew. That's all I'd done.
If I couldn't do that, then what could I do?
And the question I asked myself is, if I couldn't do that, then who was I?
They moved me from intensive care to acute spinal.
I was lying on a thin, hard spinal bed.
I had no movement in my legs. I had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots.
I had one arm in plaster, one arm tied down by drips.
I had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head and I saw my world through a mirror that was suspended above my head.
I shared the ward with five other people, and the amazing thing is that because we were all lying paralyzed in a spinal ward, we didn't know what each other looked like.
How amazing is that? How often in life do you get to make friendships, judgment-free, purely based on spirit?
And there were no superficial conversations as we shared our innermost thoughts, our fears, and our hopes for life after the spinal ward.
I remember one night, one of the nurses came in, Jonathan, with a whole lot of plastic straws.
He put a pile on top of each of us, and he said, "Start threading them together."
Well, there wasn't much else to do in the spinal ward, so we did.
And when we'd finished, he went around silently and he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward, and then he said, "Okay, everybody, hold on to your straws."
And we did. And he said, "Right. Now we're all connected."
And as we held on, and we breathed as one, we knew we weren't on this journey alone.
And even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward, there were moments of incredible depth and richness, of authenticity and connection that I had never experienced before.
And each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward we would never be the same.
After six months, it was time to go home.
I remember Dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair, wrapped in a plaster body cast, and feeling the sun on my face for the first time.
I soaked it up and I thought, how could I ever have taken this for granted?
I felt so incredibly grateful for my life.
But before I left the hospital, the head nurse had said to me, "Janine, I want you to be ready, because when you get home, something's going to happen."
And I said, "What?" And she said, "You're going to get depressed."
And I said, "Not me, not Janine the Machine," which was my nickname.
She said, "You are, because, see, it happens to everyone.
In the spinal ward, that's normal.
You're in a wheelchair. That's normal.
But you're going to get home and realize how different life is."
And I got home and something happened.
I realized Sister Sam was right.
I did get depressed.
I was in my wheelchair. I had no feeling from the waist down, attached to a catheter bottle. I couldn't walk.
I'd lost so much weight in the hospital I now weighed about 80 pounds.
And I wanted to give up.
All I wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the door.
I wanted my old life back. I wanted my body back.
And I can remember Mom sitting on the end of my bed, and saying, "I wonder if life will ever be good again."
And I thought, "How could it? Because I've lost everything that I valued, everything that I'd worked towards.
Gone."
And the question I asked was, "Why me? Why me?"
And then I remembered my friends that were still in the spinal ward, particularly Maria.
Maria was in a car accident, and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic, had no movement from the neck down, had damage to her vocal chords, and she couldn't talk.
They told me, "We're going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her."
I was worried. I didn't know how I'd react to being next to her.
I knew it would be challenging, but it was actually a blessing, because Maria always smiled.
She was always happy, and even when she began to talk again, albeit difficult to understand, she never complained, not once.
And I wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance.
And I realized that this wasn't just my life.
It was life itself. I realized that this wasn't just my pain.
It was everybody's pain. And then I knew, just like before, that I had a choice. I could keep fighting this or I could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life.
And then I stopped asking, "Why me?"
And I started to ask, "Why not me?"
And then I thought to myself, maybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start.
I had never before thought of myself as a creative person.
I was an athlete. My body was a machine.
But now I was about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do: that of rebuilding a life.
And even though I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do, in that uncertainty came a sense of freedom.
I was no longer tied to a set path.
I was free to explore life's infinite possibilities.
And that realization was about to change my life.
Sitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast, an airplane flew overhead, and I looked up, and I thought to myself, "That's it!
If I can't walk, then I might as well fly."
I said, "Mom, I'm going to learn how to fly."
She said, "That's nice, dear."
I said, "Pass me the yellow pages."
She passed me the phone book, I rang up the flying school, I made a booking, said I'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight.
They said, "You know, when do you want to come out?"
I said, "Well, I have to get a friend to drive me out because I can't drive. Sort of can't walk either.
Is that a problem?"
I made a booking, and weeks later my friend Chris and my mom drove me out to the airport, all 80 pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast in a baggy pair of overalls.
I can tell you, I did not look like the ideal candidate to get a pilot's license.
I'm holding on to the counter because I can't stand.
I said, "Hi, I'm here for a flying lesson."
And they took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws.
"You get her.""No, no, you take her."
Finally this guy comes out. He goes, "Hi, I'm Andrew, and I'm going to take you flying."
I go, "Great." And so they drive me down, they get me out on the tarmac, and there was this red, white and blue airplane.
It was beautiful. They lifted me into the cockpit.
They had to slide me up on the wing, put me in the cockpit.
They sat me down. There are buttons and dials everywhere.
I'm going, "Wow, how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do?"
Andrew the instructor got in the front, started the airplane up.
He said, "Would you like to have a go at taxiing?"
That's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals to control the airplane on the ground.
I said, "No, I can't use my legs."
He went, "Oh."
I said, "But I can use my hands," and he said, "Okay."
So he got over to the runway, and he applied the power.
And as we took off down the runway, and the wheels lifted up off the tarmac, and we became airborne, I had the most incredible sense of freedom.
And Andrew said to me, as we got over the training area, "You see that mountain over there?"
And I said, "Yeah."
And he said, "Well, you take the controls, and you fly towards that mountain."
And as I looked up, I realized that he was pointing towards the Blue Mountains where the journey had begun.
And I took the controls, and I was flying.
And I was a long, long way from that spinal ward, and I knew right then that I was going to be a pilot.
Didn't know how on Earth I'd ever pass a medical.
But I'd worry about that later, because right now I had a dream.
So I went home, I got a training diary out, and I had a plan.
And I practiced my walking as much as I could, and I went from the point of two people holding me up to one person holding me up to the point where I could walk around the furniture as long as it wasn't too far apart.
And then I made great progression to the point where I could walk around the house, holding onto the walls, like this, and Mom said she was forever following me, wiping off my fingerprints.
But at least she always knew where I was.
So while the doctors continued to operate and put my body back together again, I went on with my theory study, and then eventually, and amazingly, I passed my pilot's medical, and that was my green light to fly.
And I spent every moment I could out at that flying school, way out of my comfort zone, all these young guys that wanted to be Qantas pilots, you know, and little old hop-along me in first my plaster cast, and then my steel brace, my baggy overalls, my bag of medication and catheters and my limp, and they used to look at me and think, "Oh, who is she kidding? She's never going to be able to do this."
And sometimes I thought that too.
But that didn't matter, because now there was something inside that burned that far outweighed my injuries.
And little goals kept me going along the way, and eventually I got my private pilot's license, and then I learned to navigate, and I flew my friends around Australia.
And then I learned to fly an airplane with two engines and I got my twin engine rating.
And then I learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather and got my instrument rating.
And then I got my commercial pilot's license.
And then I got my instructor rating.
And then I found myself back at that same school where I'd gone for that very first flight, teaching other people how to fly, just under 18 months after I'd left the spinal ward.
And then I thought, "Why stop there?
Why not learn to fly upside down?"
And I did, and I learned to fly upside down and became an aerobatics flying instructor.
And Mom and Dad? Never been up.
But then I knew for certain that although my body might be limited, it was my spirit that was unstoppable.
The philosopher Lao Tzu once said, "When you let go of what you are, you become what you might be."
I now know that it wasn't until I let go of who I thought I was that I was able to create a completely new life.
It wasn't until I let go of the life I thought I should have that I was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me.
I now know that my real strength never came from my body, and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically, who I am is unchanged.
The pilot light inside of me was still a light, just as it is in each and every one of us.
I know that I'm not my body, and I also know that you're not yours.
And then it no longer matters what you look like, where you come from, or what you do for a living.
All that matters is that we continue to fan the flame of humanity by living our lives as the ultimate creative expression of who we really are, because we are all connected by millions and millions of straws, and it's time to join those up and to hang on.
And if we are to move towards our collective bliss, it's time we shed our focus on the physical and instead embrace the virtues of the heart.
So raise your straws if you'll join me.
Thank you.
Thank you.

<title>Janine Shepherd: A broken body isn't a broken person</title>
<description>Cross-country skier Janine Shepherd hoped for an Olympic medal -- until she was hit by a truck during a training bike ride. She shares a powerful story about the human potential for recovery. Her message: you are not your body, and giving up old dreams can allow new ones to soar.</description>
<keywords>health,health care,storytelling</keywords>

In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau, who said, "People protect what they love," I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean, and that's the incredible number and variety of animals in it that make light.
My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp; that's not an acronym -- just somebody thought it looked like the insect.
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet.
Right after I completed my Ph.D., I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration.
We trained in a tank in Port Hueneme, and then my first open ocean dive was in Santa Barbara Channel.
It was an evening dive.
I went down to a depth of 880 feet and turned out the lights.
And the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence.
But I was totally unprepared for how much there was and how spectacular it was.
I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room, pumping out so much light that I could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight; and puffs and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke; and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters -- just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire, but these were icy, blue embers.
It was breathtaking.
Now, usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all, it's these guys; it's fireflies.
And there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light -- some insects, earthworms, fungi -- but in general, on land, it's really rare.
In the ocean, it's the rule rather than the exception.
If I go out in the open ocean environment, virtually anywhere in the world, and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface, most of the animals -- in fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent of the animals that I bring up in that net -- make light.
This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows.
Now I want to share with you a little video that I shot from a submersible.
I first developed this technique working from a little single-person submersible called Deep Rover and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea-Link, which you see here.
So, mounted in front of the observation sphere, there's a a three-foot diameter hoop with a screen stretched across it.
And inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera that's about as sensitive as a fully dark-adapted human eye, albeit a little fuzzy.
So you turn on the camera, turn out the lights.
That sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence, that's just electronic noise on these super intensified cameras.
You don't see luminescence until the submersible begins to move forward through the water, but as it does, animals bumping into the screen are stimulated to bioluminesce.
Now, when I was first doing this, all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources.
I knew my forward speed, I knew the area, and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter.
But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals by the type of flashes they produced.
And so, here, in the Gulf of Maine at 740 feet, I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level.
Like those big explosions, sparks, are from a little comb jelly, and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans, and jellyfish.
There was another one of those comb jellies.
And so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers to develop automatic recognition systems that can identify these animals and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point.
And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land, and do nearest neighbor distances.
But you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this.
You can actually see it in surface waters.
This is some shot, by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution, of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton.
And this isn't someplace exotic like one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico, this was actually shot in San Diego Harbor.
And sometimes you can see it even closer than that, because the heads on ships -- that's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening -- are flushed with unfiltered seawater that often has bioluminescent plankton in it.
So, if you stagger into the head late at night and you're so toilet-hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light, you may think that you're having a religious experience.
So, how does a living creature make light?
Well, that was the question that 19th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois, asked about this bioluminescent clam.
He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals; one, the enzyme, he called luciferase; the substrate, he called luciferin after Lucifer the Lightbearer.
That terminology has stuck, but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms.
In fact, most of the people studying bioluminescence today are focused on the chemistry, because these chemicals have proved so incredibly valuable for developing antibacterial agents, cancer fighting drugs, testing for the presence of life on Mars, detecting pollutants in our waters -- which is how we use it at ORCA.
In 2008, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green fluorescent protein that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry of a jellyfish, and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope, in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology and genetic engineering.
Another thing all these molecules are telling us that, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved at least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times in evolutionary history, which is a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait is for survival.
So, what is it about bioluminescence that's so important to so many animals?
Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness, light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive: and that's find food, attract a mate and avoid being eaten.
So, for example, this fish has a built-in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate.
And then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your Lamborghini.
This fish actually has high beams.
And this fish, which is one of my favorites, has three headlights on each side of its head.
Now, this one is blue, and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication.
So, most animals make blue light, and most animals can only see blue light, but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs.
And I have no idea why there's two, and that's something I want to solve some day -- but not only can it see blue light, but it can see red light.
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen.
It's also got a little chin barbel here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off.
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure.
This is another one of my favorite fish.
This is a viperfish, and it's got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name.
The teeth on this fish are so long that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish, it would actually impale its own brain.
So instead, it slides in grooves on the outside of the head.
This is a Christmas tree of a fish; everything on this fish lights up, it's not just that lure.
It's got a built-in flashlight.
It's got these jewel-like light organs on its belly that it uses for a type of camouflage that obliterates its shadow, so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below, it makes itself disappear.
It's got light organs in the mouth, it's got light organs in every single scale, in the fins, in a mucus layer on the back and the belly, all used for different things -- some of which we know about, some of which we don't.
And we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar, and I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people.
I do wish, with their budget, that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor, starving graduate student, who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that's been preserved in formalin.
These are the eyes of a living anglerfish.
So, she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle-sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey.
And this one has a lure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it.
Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey, but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists, or more likely their graduate students, have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing.
So, now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world, because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males.
This little guy has no visible means of self-support.
He has no lure for attracting food and no teeth for eating it when it gets there.
His only hope for existence on this planet is as a gigolo.
He's got to find himself a babe and then he's got to latch on for life.
So this little guy has found himself this babe, and you will note that he's had the good sense to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her.
But he still knows a good thing when he sees it, and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss.
His flesh fuses with her flesh, her bloodstream grows into his body, and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac.
Well, this is a deep-sea version of Women's Lib.
She always knows where he is, and she doesn't have to be monogamous, because some of these females come up with multiple males attached.
So they can use it for finding food, for attracting mates.
They use it a lot for defense, many different ways.
A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud.
This shrimp is actually spewing light out of its mouth like a fire breathing dragon in order to blind or distract this viperfish so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness.
And there are a lot of different animals that can do this: There's jellyfish, there's squid, there's a whole lot of different crustaceans, there's even fish that can do this.
This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light.
And I was luck enough to capture one of these when we were on a trawling expedition off the northwest coast of Africa for "Blue Planet," for the deep portion of "Blue Planet."
And we were using a special trawling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive.
So we captured one of these, and I brought it into the lab.
So I'm holding it, and I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder, and when I do, you'll see bioluminescence coming out.
But to me, what's shocking is not just the amount of light, but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase.
For this fish, it's actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes.
It's energetically very costly for this fish to do this, and we have no idea why it does it -- another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved.
Now, another form of defense is something called a burglar alarm -- same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car; the honking horn and flashing lights are meant to attract the attention of, hopefully, the police that will come and take the burglar away -- when an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator, its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier that will attack their attacker, thereby affording them a chance for escape.
This jellyfish, for example, has a spectacular bioluminescent display.
This is us chasing it in the submersible.
That's not luminescence, that's reflected light from the gonads.
We capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition, bring it into the lab on the ship.
And then to generate the display you're about to see, all I did was touch it once per second on its nerve ring with a sharp pick that's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish.
And once this display gets going, I'm not touching it anymore.
This is an unbelievable light show.
It's this pinwheel of light, and I've done calculations that show that this could be seen from as much as 300 feet away by a predator.
And I thought, "You know, that might actually make a pretty good lure."
Because one of the things that's frustrated me as a deep-sea explorer is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about because of the way we explore the ocean.
The primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean is we go out and drag nets behind ships.
And I defy you to name any other branch of science that still depends on hundreds of year-old technology.
The other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote-operated vehicles.
I've made hundreds of dives in submersibles.
When I'm sitting in a submersible though, I know that I'm not unobtrusive at all -- I've got bright lights and noisy thrusters -- any animal with any sense is going to be long gone.
So, I've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore.
And so, sometime ago, I got this idea for a camera system.
It's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye-in-the-Sea.
And scientists have done this on land for years; we just use a color that the animals can't see and then a camera that can see that color.
You can't use infrared in the sea.
We use far-red light, but even that's a problem because it gets absorbed so quickly.
Made an intensified camera, wanted to make this electronic jellyfish.
Thing is, in science, you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you're going to discover before they'll give you the money.
And I didn't know what I was going to discover, so I couldn't get the funding for this.
So I kluged this together, I got the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially, and then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources.
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute gave me time with their ROV so that I could test it and we could figure out, you know, for example, which colors of red light we had to use so that we could see the animals, but they couldn't see us -- get the electronic jellyfish working.
And you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was, because we cast these 16 blue LEDs in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used, the word Ziploc is still visible.
Needless to say, when it's kluged together like this, there were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working.
But there came a moment when it all came together, and everything worked.
And, remarkably, that moment got caught on film by photographer Mark Richards, who happened to be there at the precise moment that we discovered that it all came together.
That's me on the left, my graduate student at the time, Erika Raymond, and Lee Fry, who was the engineer on the project.
And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once."
And we were very, very happy.
So now we had a system that we could actually take to some place that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean that might be patrolled by large predators.
And so, the place that we took it to was this place called a Brine Pool, which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
It's a magical place.
And I know this footage isn't going to look like anything to you -- we had a crummy camera at the time -- but I was ecstatic.
We're at the edge of the Brine Pool, there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera.
It's clearly undisturbed by us.
And I had my window into the deep sea.
I, for the first time, could see what animals were doing down there when we weren't down there disturbing them in some way.
Four hours into the deployment, we had programmed the electronic jellyfish to come on for the first time.
Eighty-six seconds after it went into its pinwheel display, we recorded this: This is a squid, over six feet long, that is so new to science, it cannot be placed in any known scientific family.
I could not have asked for a better proof of concept.
And based on this, I went back to the National Science Foundation and said, "This is what we will discover."
And they gave me enough money to do it right, which has involved developing the world's first deep-sea webcam -- which has been installed in the Monterey Canyon for the past year -- and now, more recently, a modular form of this system, a much more mobile form that's a lot easier to launch and recover, that I hope can be used on Sylvia's "hope spots" to help explore and protect these areas, and, for me, learn more about the bioluminescence in these "hope spots."
So one of these take-home messages here is, there is still a lot to explore in the oceans.
And Sylvia has said that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what's in them, and she's right.
So if you ever, ever get an opportunity to take a dive in a submersible, say yes -- a thousand times, yes -- and please turn out the lights.
I promise, you'll love it.
Thank you.

My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us.
And my little idea that will do that is sleep.
This is a room of type-A women.
This is a room of sleep-deprived women.
And I learned the hard way, the value of sleep.
Two-and-a-half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion.
I hit my head on my desk. I broke my cheekbone, I got five stitches on my right eye.
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep.
And in the course of that, I studied, I met with medical doctors, scientists, and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive, more inspired, more joyful life is getting enough sleep.
And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution, this new feminist issue.
We are literally going to sleep our way to the top, literally.
Because unfortunately for men, sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol.
I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before.
And I felt like saying to him -- but I didn't say it -- I felt like saying, "You know what?
If you had gotten five, this dinner would have been a lot more interesting."
There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship.
Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date, and you say, "How about eight o'clock?"
they're likely to tell you, "Eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's okay, I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight."
And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive, but the truth is they're not, because we, at the moment, have had brilliant leaders in business, in finance, in politics, making terrible decisions.
So a high I.Q.
does not mean that you're a good leader, because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic.
And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics.
In fact, I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters, they might still be around.
While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7, maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture.
So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment, what is good for us on a personal level, what's going to bring more joy, gratitude, effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world.
So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us, to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.
Thank you.

<title>Arianna Huffington: How to succeed? Get more sleep</title>
<description>In this short talk, Arianna Huffington shares a small idea that can awaken much bigger ones: the power of a good night's sleep. Instead of bragging about our sleep deficits, she urges us to shut our eyes and see the big picture: We can sleep our way to increased productivity and happiness -- and smarter decision-making.</description>

I'd like you to come back with me for a moment to the 19th century, specifically to June 24, 1833.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science is holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge.
It's the first night of the meeting, and a confrontation is about to take place that will change science forever.
An elderly, white-haired man stands up.
The members of the Association are shocked to realize that it's the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who hadn't even left his house in years until that day.
They're even more shocked by what he says.
"You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers."
Coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself pondered the cosmos from their armchairs.
They were not mucking around in the fossil pits or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles like the members of the British Association.
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly.
A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up and quieted the audience.
He politely agreed that an appropriate name for the members of the association did not exist.
"If 'philosophers' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term," he said, "then, by analogy with 'artist,' we may form 'scientist.'" This was the first time the word scientist was uttered in public, only 179 years ago.
I first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school, and it kind of blew me away.
I mean, how could the word scientist not have existed until 1833?
What were scientists called before?
What had changed to make a new name necessary precisely at that moment?
Prior to this meeting, those who studied the natural world were talented amateurs.
Think of the country clergyman or squire collecting his beetles or fossils, like Charles Darwin, for example, or, the hired help of a nobleman, like Joseph Priestley, who was the literary companion to the Marquis of Lansdowne when he discovered oxygen.
After this, they were scientists, professionals with a particular scientific method, goals, societies and funding.
Much of this revolution can be traced to four men who met at Cambridge University in 1812: Charles Babbage, John Herschel, Richard Jones and William Whewell.
These were brilliant, driven men who accomplished amazing things.
Charles Babbage, I think known to most TEDsters, invented the first mechanical calculator and the first prototype of a modern computer.
John Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere, and, in his spare time, co-invented photography.
I'm sure we could all be that productive without Facebook or Twitter to take up our time.
Richard Jones became an important economist who later influenced Karl Marx.
And Whewell not only coined the term scientist, as well as the words anode, cathode and ion, but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides.
In the Cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813, the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts.
They talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution.
They felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the 17th century.
It was time for a new revolution, which they pledged to bring about, and what's so amazing about these guys is, not only did they have these grandiose undergraduate dreams, but they actually carried them out, even beyond their wildest dreams.
And I'm going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made.
About 200 years before, Francis Bacon and then, later, Isaac Newton, had proposed an inductive scientific method.
Now that's a method that starts from observations and experiments and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws, which are always subject to revision or rejection should new evidence arise.
However, in 1809, David Ricardo muddied the waters by arguing that the science of economics should use a different, deductive method.
The problem was that an influential group at Oxford began arguing that because it worked so well in economics, this deductive method ought to be applied to the natural sciences too.
The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed.
They wrote books and articles promoting inductive method in all the sciences that were widely read by natural philosophers, university students and members of the public.
Reading one of Herschel's books was such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin that he would later say, "Scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me.
It made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge."
It also shaped Darwin's scientific method, as well as that used by his peers.
[Science for the public good] Previously, it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen, or for one's own personal gain.
For example, ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports.
Harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains.
The philosophical breakfast club changed that, working together.
Whewell's worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters' knowledge to all ship captains.
Herschel helped by making tidal observations off the coast of South Africa, and, as he complained to Whewell, he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble.
The four men really helped each other in every way.
They also relentlessly lobbied the British government for the money to build Babbage's engines because they believed these engines would have a huge practical impact on society.
In the days before pocket calculators, the numbers that most professionals needed -- bankers, insurance agents, ship captains, engineers — were to be found in lookup books like this, filled with tables of figures.
These tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part-time workers known as -- and this is amazing -- computers, but these calculations were really difficult.
I mean, this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year.
Each month required 1,365 calculations, so these tables were filled with mistakes.
Babbage's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator devised to accurately compute any of these tables.
Two models of his engine were built in the last 20 years by a team from the Science Museum of London using his own plans.
This is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California, and it calculates accurately. It actually works.
Later, Babbage's analytical engine was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense.
It had a separate memory and central processor.
It was capable of iteration, conditional branching and parallel processing, and it was programmable using punched cards, an idea Babbage took from Jacquard's loom.
Tragically, Babbage's engines never were built in his day because most people thought that non-human computers would have no usefulness for the public.
[New scientific institutions] Founded in Bacon's time, the Royal Society of London was the foremost scientific society in England and even in the rest of the world.
By the 19th century, it had become a kind of gentleman's club populated mainly by antiquarians, literary men and the nobility.
The members of the philosophical breakfast club helped form a number of new scientific societies, including the British Association.
These new societies required that members be active researchers publishing their results.
They reinstated the tradition of the Q&amp;A after scientific papers were read, which had been discontinued by the Royal Society as being ungentlemanly.
And for the first time, they gave women a foot in the door of science.
Members were encouraged to bring their wives, daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association, and while the women were expected to attend only the public lectures and the social events like this one, they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well.
The British Association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members.
[External funding for science] Up to the 19th century, natural philosophers were expected to pay for their own equipment and supplies.
Occasionally, there were prizes, such as that given to John Harrison in the 18th century, for solving the so-called longitude problem, but prizes were only given after the fact, when they were given at all.
On the advice of the philosophical breakfast club, the British Association began to use the extra money generated by its meetings to give grants for research in astronomy, the tides, fossil fish, shipbuilding, and many other areas.
These grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research, but they also encouraged thinking outside the box, rather than just trying to solve one pre-set question.
Eventually, the Royal Society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit, and this has become -- fortunately it's become -- a major part of the scientific landscape today.
So the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist.
That's the heroic part of their story.
There's a flip side as well.
They did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution.
They would have been deeply dismayed by today's disjunction between science and the rest of culture.
It's shocking to realize that only 28 percent of American adults have even a very basic level of science literacy, and this was tested by asking simple questions like, "Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time?"
and "What proportion of the Earth is covered in water?"
Once scientists became members of a professional group, they were slowly walled off from the rest of us.
This is the unintended consequence of the revolution that started with our four friends.
Charles Darwin said, "I sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as important for the progress of science as original work."
In fact, "Origin of Species" was written for a general and popular audience, and was widely read when it first appeared.
Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten, that science is not only for scientists.
Thank you.

Pat Mitchell: You have brought us images from the Yemen Times.
And take us through those, and introduce us to another Yemen.
Nadia Al-Sakkaf: Well, I'm glad to be here.
And I would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.
This picture shows a revolution started by women, and it shows women and men leading a mixed protest.
The other picture is the popularity of the real need for change.
So many people are there.
The intensity of the upspring.
This picture shows that the revolution has allowed opportunities for training, for education.
These women are learning about first aid and their rights according to the constitution.
I love this picture.
I just wanted to show that over 60 percent of the Yemeni population are 15 years and below.
And they were excluded from decision-making, and now they are in the forefront of the news, raising the flag.
English -- you will see, this is jeans and tights, and an English expression -- the ability to share with the world what is going on in our own country.
And expression also, it has brought talents.
Yemenis are using cartoons and art, paintings, comics, to tell the world and each other about what's going on.
Obviously, there's always the dark side of it.
And this is just one of the less-gruesome pictures of the revolution and the cost that we have to pay.
The solidarity of millions of Yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing.
And finally, lots of people are saying that Yemen's revolution is going to break the country.
Is it going to be so many different countries?
Is it going to be another Somalia?
But we want to tell the world that, no, under the one flag, we'll still remain as Yemeni people.
PM: Thank you for those images, Nadia.
And they do, in many ways, tell a different story than the story of Yemen, the one that is often in the news.
And yet, you yourself defy all those characterizations.
So let's talk about the personal story for a moment.
Your father is murdered.
The Yemen Times already has a strong reputation in Yemen as an independent English language newspaper.
How did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities of running a newspaper, especially in such times of conflict?
N Well, let me first warn you that I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl.
I've guessed you've already noticed this by now.
In Yemen, most women are veiled and they are sitting behind doors and not very much part of the public life.
But there's so much potential.
I wish I could show you my Yemen.
I wish you could see Yemen through my eyes.
Then you would know that there's so much to it.
And I was privileged because I was born into a family, my father would always encourage the boys and the girls.
He would say we are equal.
And he was such an extraordinary man.
And even my mother -- I owe it to my family.
A story: I studied in India.
And in my third year, I started becoming confused because I was Yemeni, but I was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college.
And I went back home and I said, "Daddy, I don't know who I am.
I'm not a Yemeni; I'm not an Indian."
And he said, "You are the bridge."
And that is something I will keep in my heart forever.
So since then I've been the bridge, and a lot of people have walked over me.
PM: I don't think so.
N But it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society.
And when I became editor-in-chief after my brother actually -- my father passed away in 1999, and then my brother until 2005 -- and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it.
"What's this young girl coming in and showing off because it's her family business," or something.
It was very hard at first.
I didn't want to clash with people.
But with all due respect to all the men, and the older men especially, they did not want me around.
It was very hard, you know, to impose my authority.
But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do.
And in the first year, I had to fire half of the men.
Brought in more women.
Brought in younger men.
And we have a more gender-balanced newsroom today.
The other thing is that it's about professionalism.
It's about proving who you are and what you can do.
And I don't know if I'm going to be boasting now, but in 2006 alone, we won three international awards.
One of them is the IPI Free Media Pioneer Award.
So that was the answer to all the Yemeni people.
And I want to score a point here, because my husband is in the room over there.
If you could please stand up, [unclear].
He has been very supportive of me.
PM: And we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper.
But in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have, you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society and the one that you are now creating at the paper.
And so along with changing who worked there, you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into, in particular with women, and it has to do with outside image, dress, the veiled woman.
So how have you dealt with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you?
N As you know, the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black and covered, veiled women.
And this is true.
And a lot of it is because women are not able, are not free, to show their face to their self.
It's a lot of traditional imposing coming by authority figures such as the men, the grandparents and so on.
And it's economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say, "I am as much contributing to this family, or more, than you are."
And the more empowered the women become, the more they are able to remove the veil, for example, or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel.
So the other face of Yemen is actually one that lies behind the veil, and it's economic empowerment mostly that allows the woman to just uncover it.
And I have done this throughout my work.
I've tried to encourage young girls.
We started with, you can take it off in the office.
And then after that, you can take it off on assignments.
Because I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with -- how can you talk to people if you have your face covered? -- and so on; it's just a movement.
And I am a role model in Yemen.
A lot of people look up to me.
A lot of young girls look up to me.
And I need to prove to them that, yes, you can still be married, you can still be a mother, and you can still be respected within the society, but at the same time, that doesn't mean you [should] just be one of the crowd.
You can be yourself and have your face.
PM: But by putting yourself personally out there -- both projecting a different image of Yemeni women, but also what you have made possible for the women who work at the paper -- has this put you in personal danger?
N Well the Yemen Times, across 20 years, has been through so much.
We've suffered prosecution; the paper was closed down more than three times.
It's an independent newspaper, but tell that to the people in charge.
They think that if there's anything against them, then we are being an opposition newspaper.
And very, very difficult times.
Some of my reporters were arrested.
We had some court cases.
My father was assassinated.
Today, we are in a much better situation.
We've created the credibility.
And in times of revolution or change like today, it is very important for independent media to have a voice.
It's very important for you to go to YemenTimes.com, and it's very important to listen to our voice.
And this is probably something I'm going to share with you in Western media probably -- and how there's a lot of stereotypes -- thinking of Yemen in one single frame: this is what Yemen is all about.
And that's not fair.
It's not fair for me; it's not fair for my country.
A lot of reporters come to Yemen and they want to write a story on Al-Qaeda or terrorism.
And I just wanted to share with you: there's one reporter that came.
He wanted to do a documentary on what his editors wanted.
And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me -- hip hop -- that there are young Yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and puchu puchu.
That thing.
Yeah, break dancing.
I'm not so old.
I'm just not in touch.
PM: Yes, you are.
Actually, that's a documentary that's available online; the video's online.
N ShaketheDust.org.
PM: "Shake the Dust."
PM: ShaketheDust.org.
And it definitely does give a different image of Yemen.
You spoke about the responsibility of the press.
And certainly, when we look at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others and we've created fear and danger, often from lack of knowledge, lack of real understanding, how do you see the way that the Western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region, but in particular, in your country?
N Well there is a saying that says, "You fear what you don't know, and you hate what you fear."
So it's about the lack of research, basically.
It's almost, "Do your homework," -- some involvement.
And you cannot do parachute reporting -- just jump into a country for two days and think that you've done your homework and a story.
So I wish that the world would know my Yemen, my country, my people.
I am an example, and there are others like me.
We may not be that many, but if we are promoted as a good, positive example, there will be others -- men and women -- who can eventually bridge the gap -- again, coming to the bridge -- between Yemen and the world and telling first about recognition and then about communication and compassion.
I think Yemen is going to be in a very bad situation in the next two or three years.
It's natural.
But after the two years, which is a price we are willing to pay, we are going to stand up again on our feet, but in the new Yemen with a younger and more empowered people -- democratic.
PM: Nadia, I think you've just given us a very different view of Yemen.
And certainly you yourself and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be grateful for.
And the very best of luck to you.
YemenTimes.com.
N On Twitter also.
PM: So you are plugged in.

You may not know this, but you are celebrating an anniversary with me.
I'm not married, but one year ago today, I woke up from a month-long coma, following a double lung transplant.
Crazy, I know. Insane.
Thank you.
Six years before that, I was starting my career as an opera singer in Europe, when I was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension -- also known as PH.
It happens when there's a thickening making the right side of the heart work overtime, and causing what I call the reverse-Grinch effect.
My heart was three-and-a-half sizes too big.
Physical activity becomes very difficult for people with this condition, and usually after two to five years, you die.
I went to see this specialist, and she was top-of-the-field and told me I had to stop singing.
She said, "Those high notes are going to kill you."
While she didn't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension, she was absolutely emphatic I was singing my own obituary.
I was very limited by my condition, physically.
But I was not limited when I sang, and as air came up from my lungs, through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound, it was the closest thing I had ever come to transcendence.
And just because of someone's hunch, I wasn't going to give it up.
Thankfully, I met Reda Girgis, who is dry as toast, but he and his team at Johns Hopkins didn't just want me to survive, they wanted me to live a meaningful life.
This meant making trade-offs.
I come from Colorado.
It's a mile high, and I grew up there with my 10 brothers and sisters and two adoring parents.
Well, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms.
So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in a conservatory nearby.
I couldn't walk as much as I used to, so I opted for five-inch heels.
And I gave up salt, I went vegan, and I started taking huge doses of sildenafil, also known as Viagra.
My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for PH, but after six months, I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs.
I could barely stand up without feeling like I was going to faint.
I had a heart catheterization, where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure, which is supposed to be between 15 and 20.
Mine was 146.
I like to do things big, and it meant one thing: there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan, and it's not just a drug; it's a way of life.
Doctors insert a catheter into your chest, which is attached to a pump that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds.
Every day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side, administering medicine directly to your heart, and it's not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses.
This is a list of the side effects: if you eat too much salt, like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you'll probably end up in the ICU.
If you go through a metal detector, you'll probably die.
If you get a bubble in your medicine -- because you have to mix it every morning -- and it stays in there, you probably die.
If you run out of medicine, you definitely die.
No one wants to go on Flolan.
But when I needed it, it was a godsend.
Within a few days, I could walk again.
Within a few weeks, I was performing, and in a few months, I debuted at the Kennedy Center.
The pump was a little bit problematic when performing, so I'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage.
Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my Spanx, hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly.
And the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers.
I graduated from graduate school in 2006, and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe.
A few days after arriving, I met this wonderful, old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles.
And before long, I was commuting between Budapest, Milan and Florence.
Though I was attached to this ugly, unwanted, high-maintenance, mechanical pet, my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera -- very complicated, but in a good way.
Then in February of 2008, my grandfather passed away.
He was a big figure in all of our lives, and we loved him very much.
It certainly didn't prepare me for what came next.
Seven weeks later, I got a call from my family.
My father had been in a catastrophic car accident, and he died.
At 24, my death would have been entirely expected.
But his -- well, the only way I can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline.
Against my doctors' and family's wishes, I needed to go back for the funeral.
I had to say goodbye in some way, shape or form.
But soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure, and I had to return to sea level, doing so knowing that I probably would never see my home again.
I canceled most of my engagements that summer, but I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went.
After one performance, I could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab.
I sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face, and in the heat of the desert, I was freezing cold.
My fingers started turning blue, and I was like, "What is going on here?"
I heard my heart's valves snapping open and closed.
The cab stopped, and I pulled my body from it feeling each ounce of weight as I walked to the elevator.
I fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom where I found my problem: I had forgotten to mix in the most important part of my medicine.
I was dying, and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast, I would never leave that apartment alive.
I started mixing, and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another, but I just kept on going.
Finally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out, I attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in soon enough.
If it didn't, I'd probably see my father sooner than I anticipated.
Thankfully, in a few minutes, I saw the signature hive-like rash appear on my legs, which is a side effect of the medication, and I knew I'd be okay.
We're not big on fear in my family, but I was scared.
I went back to the States, anticipating I'd return to Europe, but the heart catheterization showed that I wasn't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital.
I performed here and there, but as my condition deteriorated, so did my voice.
My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.
I didn't.
I had two friends who had recently died months after having very challenging surgeries.
I knew another young man, though, who had PH who died while waiting for one.
I wanted to live.
I thought stem cells were a good option, but they hadn't developed to a point where I could take advantage of them yet.
I officially took a break from singing, and I went to the Cleveland Clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years, for transplant.
I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon, and I asked him if I needed a transplant, what I could do to prepare.
He said, "Be happy.
A happy patient is a healthy patient."
It was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and Confucius.
I still didn't want a transplant, but in a month, I was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles -- very attractive.
And it was right-heart failure.
I finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice.
It was time for me to go to Cleveland and to start the agonizing wait for a match.
But the next morning, while I was still in the hospital, I got a telephone call.
It was my doctor in Cleveland, Marie Budev.
And they had lungs.
It was a match.
They were from Texas.
And everybody was really happy for me, but me.
Because, despite their problems, I had spent my whole life training my lungs, and I was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up.
I flew to Cleveland, and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye.
But organs don't wait, and I went into surgery before I could say goodbye.
The last thing I remember was lying on a white blanket, telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again, and to please try and save my voice.
I fell into this apocalyptic dream world.
During the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery, I flatlined twice, 40 quarts of blood were infused into my body.
And in my surgeon's 20-year career, he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he's ever performed.
They left my chest open for two weeks.
You could see my over-sized heart beating inside of it.
I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive.
An infection ravaged my skin.
I had hoped my voice would be saved, but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it.
If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again.
So my doctor got the ENT, the top guy at the clinic, to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box.
He said it would kill me.
So my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.
Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery, she didn't leave my side in the months of recovery that followed.
And if you want an example of perseverance, grit and strength in a beautiful, little package, it is her.
One year ago to this very day, I woke up.
I was 95 lbs.
There were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body.
I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk, I couldn't eat, I couldn't move, I certainly couldn't sing, I couldn't even breathe, but when I looked up and I saw my mother, I couldn't help but smile.
Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs, death happens.
But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?
It's about living.
Medical conditions don't negate the human condition.
And when people are allowed to pursue their passions, doctors will find they have better, happier and healthier patients.
My parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place, but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.
And I'm so grateful they did.
This past summer, when I was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the Colorado Rockies, I couldn't help but think of that doctor who told me that I couldn't sing.
And I wanted to tell her, and I want to tell you, we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams.
When we do, we will find that patients don't just survive; we thrive.
And some of us might even sing.
[Singing: French] Thank you.
Thank you.
And I'd like to thank my pianist, Monica Lee.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

So, if you're in the audience today, or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place, you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem.
Whether you're an artist, a technologist, a lawyer or a fan, the handling of copyright directly impacts your life.
Rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership, it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape.
YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners, but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies, mashups and more, we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site.
Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works.
Two years ago, recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single "Forever."
A fan saw it on TV, recorded it with her camera phone, and uploaded it to YouTube.
Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video in our Content ID system, within seconds of attempting to upload the video, the copy was detected, giving Sony the choice of what to do next.
But how do we know that the user's video was a copy?
Well, it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database, along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match.
We compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database.
This heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works.
Here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content.
The system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match.
This means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file, plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality.
And we do this every time that a video is uploaded to YouTube.
And that's over 20 hours of video every minute.
When we find a match, we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down.
And the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking.
We're not just talking about a few videos, we're talking about over 100 years of video every day, between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site.
When we compare those hundred years of video, we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database.
It would be like 36,000 people staring at 36,000 monitors each and every day, without so much as a coffee break.
Now, what do we do when we find a match?
Well, most rights owners, instead of blocking, will allow the copy to be published.
And then they benefit through the exposure, advertising and linked sales.
Remember Chris Brown's video "Forever"?
Well, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts, and that looked like the end of the story, but sometime last year, a young couple got married.
This is their wedding video.
You may have seen it.
What's amazing about this is, if the processional of the wedding was this much fun, can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been?
I mean, who are these people?
I totally want to go to that wedding.
So their little wedding video went on to get over 40 million views.
And instead of Sony blocking, they allowed the upload to occur.
And they put advertising against it and linked from it to iTunes.
And the song, 18 months old, went back to number four on the iTunes charts.
So Sony is generating revenue from both of these.
And Jill and Kevin, the happy couple, they came back from their honeymoon and found that their video had gone crazy viral.
And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows, and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference.
The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence.
The "JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance" became so popular that NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office," which just goes to show, it's truly an ecosystem of culture.
Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios, but sometimes big studios borrowing back.
By empowering choice, we can create a culture of opportunity.
And all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification.
So why has no one ever solved this problem before?
It's because it's a big problem, and it's complicated and messy.
It's not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners.
There's musical labels.
There's multiple music publishers.
And each of these can vary by country.
There's lots of cases where we have more than one work mashed together.
So we have to manage many claims to the same video.
YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases.
But the system only works through the participation of rights owners.
If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube, you should register in the Content ID system, and then you'll have the choice about how your content is used.
And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content.
By simply blocking all reuse, you'll miss out on new art forms, new audiences, new distribution channels and new revenue streams.
But it's not just about dollars and impressions.
Just look at all the joy that was spread through progressive rights management and new technology.
And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading.
Thank you.

As a child, I was raised by native Hawaiian elders -- three old women who took care of me while my parents worked.
The year is 1963.
We're at the ocean.
It's twilight.
We're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides.
It's a stretch of beach we know so well.
The smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us.
If you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes, you might dismiss them as poor and simple.
That would be a mistake.
These women are descendants of Polynesian navigators, trained in the old ways by their elders, and now they're passing it on to me.
They teach me the names of the winds and the rains, of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars.
There's a new moon on the horizon.
Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing.
They begin to chant.
[Hawaiian chant] When they finish, they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them.
They want to teach me about my destiny.
I thought every seven-year-old went through this.
"Baby girl, someday the world will be in trouble.
People will forget their wisdom.
It will take elders' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance.
You will go far away.
It will sometimes be a lonely road.
We will not be there.
But you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers, and you will recognize your ohana, your family.
And it will take all of you.
It will take all of you."
These words, I hold onto all my life.
Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me.
The year is 2007.
I'm on a remote island in Micronesia.
Satawal is one half-mile long by one mile wide.
It's the home of my mentor.
His name is Pius Mau Piailug.
Mau is a palu, a navigator priest.
He's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world.
There are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island.
Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the Pacific without the use of instruments.
They could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars, the sequence and direction of waves, the flight patterns of certain birds.
Even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy.
When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull, it appeared that an old man was going to rest.
In fact, the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel.
It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves.
Mau was, in fact, gathering explicit data using his entire body.
It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old.
Now science may dismiss this methodology, but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel.
The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance.
Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island, and he would look out, and then he would say, "Okay, we go."
He saw that first glint of light -- he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now.
Their achievements, intellectually and scientifically, are extraordinary, and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms.
We are in such a critical moment of our collective history.
They have been compared to astronauts -- these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double-hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island.
Their canoes, our rockets; their sea, our space.
The wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot.
This is part of our collective narrative.
It's humanity's DNA.
We cannot afford to lose it.
The year is 2010.
Just as the women in Hawaii that raised me predicted, the world is in trouble.
We live in a society bloated with data, yet starved for wisdom.
We're connected 24/7, yet anxiety, fear, depression and loneliness is at an all-time high.
We must course-correct.
An African shaman said, "Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes."
The link between the past and the future is fragile.
This I know intimately, because even as I travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them, I struggle.
I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains.
Mau passed away five months ago, but his legacy and lessons live on.
And I am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them, as potent as the Micronesian navigators, that are going dismissed, that this is a testament to brilliant, brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly.
Because when an elder dies a library is burned, and throughout the world, libraries are ablaze.
I am grateful for the fact that I had a mentor like Mau who taught me how to navigate.
And I realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way.
And this is what he said: "The island is the canoe; the canoe, the island."
And what he meant was, if you are voyaging and far from home, your very survival depends on everyone aboard.
You cannot make the voyage alone, you were never meant to.
This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable.
It always was.
So in closing I would offer you this: The planet is our canoe, and we are the voyagers.
True navigation begins in the human heart.
It's the most important map of all.
Together, may we journey well.

How do you observe something you can't see?
This is the basic question of somebody who's interested in finding and studying black holes.
Because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it, not even light, so you can't see it directly.
So, my story today about black holes is about one particular black hole.
I'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive, what we like to call "supermassive" black hole at the center of our galaxy.
And the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist.
And second, it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment, and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in.
So, to begin with, we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole.
So, what is a black hole?
Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object, because there are only three characteristics that you can describe: the mass, the spin, and the charge.
And I'm going to only talk about the mass.
So, in that sense, it's a very simple object.
But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe, and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe.
But today, the way I want you to understand a black hole, for the proof of a black hole, is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume.
So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about an object that's supermassive, and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment, it has no finite size.
So, this is a little tricky.
But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see, and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius.
And that's named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius.
This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.
So why is it so important?
It's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole.
That means you, your neighbor, your cellphone, the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the Schwarzschild radius.
At that point, what's going to happen?
At that point gravity wins.
Gravity wins over all other known forces.
And the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object.
And then it's a black hole.
So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube, it would become a black hole, because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.
Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.
And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.
It depends only on the mass of the object.
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.
So, if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford, it would become a black hole.
So, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is.
And it's actually quite a useful concept, because it tells us not only when a black hole will form, but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.
I only need two things.
I need to understand the mass of the object I'm claiming is a black hole, and what its Schwarzschild radius is.
And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius, there is actually only one thing I really need to know.
So, my job in convincing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.
And your job today is to be skeptical.
Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole; I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.
So, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is, as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.
An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star's life.
So, if a star starts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the Sun, it's going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.
And inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.
On an astronomical scale that's a very small black hole.
Now, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes.
And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.
And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.
There are big ones. There are little ones.
Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.
And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy, just to give you a sense of scale.
And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy, which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here, comes from the light from the stars.
So, we see the galaxy because of the star light.
Now, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies.
I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world, because they are kind of show offs.
And we call them active galactic nuclei.
And we call them that because their nucleus, or their center, are very active.
So, at the center there, that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from.
And yet, what we actually see is light that can't be explained by the starlight.
It's way more energetic.
In fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.
There are also jets emanating out from the center.
Again, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.
So, what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes which matter is falling on to.
So, you can't see the black hole itself, but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see.
So, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies.
But it's a kind of indirect argument.
Nonetheless, it's given rise to the notion that maybe it's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes, but rather all galaxies might harbor these supermassive black holes at their centers.
And if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy; what we see is the star light.
And if there is a supermassive black hole, what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.
Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei.
If we're going to look for these stealth black holes at the center of galaxies, the best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.
And this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the Milky Way.
And what we see is a line of stars.
And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened, disk-like structure.
And we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center, we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy, or line that defines the plane of the galaxy.
Now, the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy is 100 times further away.
So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else.
And as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail is key to this experiment.
So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume?
Which is the job that I have to show you today.
And the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole.
Stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun.
It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit.
If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off, or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit.
So, this is great, because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume.
So, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.
And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.
So, I want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.
So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.
And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used the world's largest telescope.
This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court.
Now, this is wonderful, because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope, the smaller the detail that we can see.
But it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.
And that is because of the atmosphere.
Atmosphere is great for us; it allows us to survive here on Earth.
But it's relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.
So, to give you a sense of what this is like, it's actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream.
Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream, the stream is continuously moving and turbulent, Very much in the same way, it's very difficult to see astronomical sources, because of the atmosphere that's continuously moving by.
So, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.
And that buys us about a factor of 20.
And I think all of you can agree that if you can figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20, you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot, say your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.
And this animation here shows you one example of the techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.
You're seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique -- in other words, just a picture that shows the stars -- and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy, where we think the black hole is.
So, without this technology you can't see the stars.
With this technology all of a sudden you can see it.
This technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.
So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.
Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on that little square there.
So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square, although we've looked at all of them.
So, I want to see how these things have moved.
And over the course of this experiment, these stars have moved a tremendous amount.
So, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years, and we see the stars go all the way around.
Now, most astronomers have a favorite star, and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.
Absolutely my favorite star in the world.
And that's because it goes around in only 15 years.
And to give you a sense of how short that is, the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.
Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible, take 500 years.
And this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.
That's kind of profound, in a way.
But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me how much mass is inside a very small radius.
So, next we see a picture here that shows you before this experiment the size to which we could confine the mass of the center of the galaxy.
What we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the sun inside that circle.
And as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.
You can see a lot of stars.
So, there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, because you could put a lot of stuff in there.
But with this experiment, we've confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that's 10,000 times smaller.
And because of that, we've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there.
To give you a sense of how small that size is, that's the size of our solar system.
So, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume.
Now, truth in advertising. Right?
I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.
And the truth is, I'm not quite there.
But we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass.
And, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.
So, what next? I actually think this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology, so let's move on with the problem.
So, what I want to tell you, very briefly, is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is, or at least we believe, that there is a supermassive black hole there.
And the fun phase of this experiment is, while we've tested some of our ideas about the consequences of a supermassive black hole being at the center of our galaxy, almost every single one has been inconsistent with what we actually see.
And that's the fun.
So, let me give you the two examples.
You can ask, "What do you expect for the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole."
What you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole.
You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.
Likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars, they just should not be there.
A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.
To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.
And it's a very fragile entity.
And what does the big black hole do?
It strips that gas cloud apart.
It pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart.
In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.
So, you shouldn't see young stars.
So, what do we see?
Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today, we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.
The old ones are red.
The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.
So, you can already see the surprise.
There is a dearth of old stars.
There is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.
So, this is the fun part.
And in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out, this mystery of how do you get -- how do you resolve this contradiction.
So, in fact, my graduate students are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope, in Hawaii, making observations to get us hopefully to the next stage, where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars, and so few old stars.
To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away.
To do that we'll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have today.
Because, in truth, while I said we're correcting for the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only correct for half the errors that are introduced.
We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere, and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest.
So this is what we hope to do in the next few years.
And on a much longer time scale, what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes, because, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.
So, we want to build a 30 meter telescope.
And with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.
And we hope to be able to test some of Einstein's theories of general relativity, some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.
So, we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting.
So, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving, in three dimensions.
And I hope, if nothing else, I've convinced you that, one, we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.
And this means that these things do exist in our universe, and we have to contend with this, we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world.
Second, we've been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact, and understand, maybe, the role in which they play in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.
none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that's been made on the technology front.
And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast, and holds a lot in store for the future.
Thanks very much.

Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Like the speaker before me, I am -- that's the TED virgin, I guess -- I'm also the first time here, and I don't know what to say.
I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me.
I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone.
And the song that I just played was by Józef Hofmann.
It's called "Kaleidoscope."
And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century, and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.
I have another piece that I'd like to play for you.
It's called "Abegg Variations," by Robert Schumann, a German 19th century composer.
The name "Abegg" -- "Abegg" is actually A-B-E-G-G, and that's the main theme in the melody.
That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.
But he wrote that for his wife.
So, actually, if you listen carefully, there's supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.
It's written around 1834, so, even though it's old, I hope you like it.
Now comes the part that I hate.
Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called "Sync and Flow," I was wondering, "What do I know that these geniuses don't?"
So, I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start.
How do I compose?
I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose.
What I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas -- you can just improvise here at the piano -- and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody, like the Abegg that you just heard.
And once I choose my main theme I have to decide, out of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want?
And this year I composed a Romantic style.
So, for inspiration I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers.
Next, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers.
They help me plan out the whole piece, and then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas, because then you have to think.
And then, when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form -- solidified, excuse me -- solidified form, you're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details, and then polish the overall performance of the composition.
And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing -- drawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art.
I think that's a craze among teens right now.
And once I realized it, there's a parallel between creating music and creating art, because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing, it's your character -- you want to decide who do you want to draw, or if you want to draw an original character.
And then you want to decide, how are you going to draw the character?
Like, am I going to use one page?
Am I going to draw it on the computer?
Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect, I guess?
And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character, which is like your structure of a piece, and then you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need -- that's polishing the drawing.
And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind, because I don't -- I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted, so if I'm trying to do homework, if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time.
And then what happens is, sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all, and then it's like there's too much on your mind.
You can't focus on what you're supposed to do.
And sometimes, if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally.
What happens is, if something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly, and then that's what I consider "flow," because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything.
You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.
I'm not going to play my own composition today because, although I did finish it, it's way too long.
Instead, I'd like to try something called "improvisation."
I have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet, and I'd like someone to come up here and choose five -- anyone to come up here and choose five -- and then I can make it into some sort of melody and I'll improvise it.
Wow, a volunteer, yay!
Nice to meet you.
Goldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five?
Jennifer Lin: Yes, five cards. Any five cards.
GH: OK. One. Two. Three.
Oh, D and F -- too familiar.
JL: One more.
GH: OK, E for effort.
JL: Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?
GH: OK. C, G, B, A and E.
JL: Thank you very much.
GH: You're welcome. And what about these?
JL: I won't use them. Thank you.
Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E.
I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.
OK, that's nice.
So, I'm going to have a moment to think, and I'll try to make something out of it.
The next song, or the encore, that I'm going to play is called "Bumble Boogie," by Jack Fina.

It's a great time to be a molecular biologist.
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper.
By the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than 1,000 euros.
Biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest-growing technology sector.
It has the power, potentially, to replace our fossil fuels, to revolutionize medicine, and to touch every aspect of our daily lives.
So who gets to do it?
I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it.
But what about that guy?
In 2009, I first heard about DIYbio.
It's a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone, not just scientists and people in government labs.
The idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate, it could really stimulate innovation.
Putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea of what their needs are.
And here's this really sophisticated technology coming down the road, all these associated social, moral, ethical questions, and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs.
So wouldn't it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff, do it hands-on?
I thought so.
So, three years ago, I got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded Genspace.
It's a nonprofit, a community biotech lab in Brooklyn, New York, and the idea was people could come, they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open, friendly atmosphere.
None of my previous experience prepared me for what came next. Can you guess?
The press started calling us.
And the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy, the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next Frankenstein, and as a result, for the next six months, when you Googled my name, instead of getting my scientific papers, you got this.
["Am I a biohazard?"] It was pretty depressing.
The only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world, there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were.
They were opening biohacker spaces, and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did, more regulations, less resources.
But now, three years later, here's where we stand.
It's a vibrant, global community of hackerspaces, and this is just the beginning.
These are some of the biggest ones, and there are others opening every day.
There's one probably going to open up in Moscow, one in South Korea, and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of.
Let me take you on a little tour.
Biohackers work alone.
We work in groups, in big cities — — and in small villages.
We reverse engineer lab equipment.
We genetically engineer bacteria.
We hack hardware, software, wetware, and, of course, the code of life.
We like to build things.
Then we like to take things apart.
We make things grow.
We make things glow.
And we make cells dance.
The spirit of these labs, it's open, it's positive, but, you know, sometimes when people think of us, the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety, bio-security, all the dark side stuff.
I'm not going to minimize those concerns.
Any powerful technology is inherently dual use, and, you know, you get something like synthetic biology, nanobiotechnology, it really compels you, you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups, because they have better infrastructure, they have better facilities, and they have access to pathogens.
So the United Nations did just that, and they recently issued a report on this whole area, and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative, and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community, and they noted, not surprisingly, that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics.
As a matter of fact, DIY people from all over the world, America, Europe, got together last year, and we hammered out a common code of ethics.
That's a lot more than conventional science has done.
Now, we follow state and local regulations.
We dispose of our waste properly, we follow safety procedures, we don't work with pathogens.
You know, if you're working with a pathogen, you're not part of the biohacker community, you're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry.
And sometimes people ask me, "Well, what about an accident?"
Well, working with the safe organisms that we normally work with, the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating, like, some sort of superbug, that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert.
Now, it could happen, but I'm not going to plan my life around it.
I've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk.
I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project.
It's a study at Harvard where, at the end of the study, they're going to take my entire genomic sequence, all of my medical information, and my identity, and they're going to post it online for everyone to see.
There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion.
The one I liked the best is, someone could download my sequence, go back to the lab, synthesize some fake Ellen DNA, and plant it at a crime scene.
But like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk.
Now, you might be asking yourself, "Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?"
Well, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, "Well, what would anyone do with a personal computer?"
So this stuff is just beginning.
We're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg.
Let me show you what you could do right now.
A biohacker in Germany, a journalist, wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street?
Yep, you guessed it. He threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs, analyzed the saliva, identified the dog, and confronted the dog owner.
I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard.
Looked like a ladybug, right?
It actually is a Japanese beetle.
And the same kind of technology -- it's called DNA barcoding, it's really cool -- You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga, if that sushi is really tuna, or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat's.
In a biohacker space, you can analyze your genome for mutations.
You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's, and you can explore your ancestry.
You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere, collect microbes, see what's up there.
You can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water.
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell.
You can do a lot of things.
You can also do an art science project. Some of these are really spectacular, and they look at social, ecological problems from a completely different perspective.
It's really cool.
Some people ask me, well, why am I involved?
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science.
The thing is, there's something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can't find anywhere else.
There's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money, that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.
It just has to follow safety guidelines.
If you had spaces like this all over the world, it could really change the perception of who's allowed to do biotech.
It's spaces like these that spawned personal computing.
Why not personal biotech?
If everyone in this room got involved, who knows what we could do?
This is such a new area, and as we say back in Brooklyn, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
<talkid>1568</talkid>
<title>Ellen Jorgensen: Biohacking -- you can do it, too</title>
<description>We have personal computing, why not personal biotech? That's the question biologist Ellen Jorgensen and her colleagues asked themselves before opening Genspace, a nonprofit DIYbio lab in Brooklyn devoted to citizen science, where amateurs can go and tinker with biotechnology. Far from being a sinister Frankenstein's lab , Genspace offers a long list of fun, creative and practical uses for DIYbio.</description>

Let's begin with a story.
Once upon a time -- well actually less than two years ago -- in a kingdom not so very far away, there was a man who traveled many miles to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown -- an internationally famous company.
Let's call it Island Networks.
Now this kingdom had many resources and mighty ambitions, but the one thing it lacked was people.
And so it invited workers from around the world to come and help it build the nation.
But in order to enter and to stay these migrants had to pass a few tests.
And so it was, our man presented himself to authorities in the kingdom, looking forward to settling into his new life.
But then something unexpected happened.
The medical personnel who took blood samples from the man never actually told him what they were testing for.
He wasn't offered counseling before or after the test, which is best medical practice.
He was never informed of the results of the test.
And yet, a couple of weeks later, he was picked up and taken to prison where he was subjected to a medical exam, including a full-body search in full view of the others in the cell.
He was released, but then a day or two later, he was taken to the airport and he was deported.
What on earth did this man do to merit this treatment?
What was his terrible crime?
He was infected with HIV.
Now the kingdom is one of about 50 countries that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay of people living with HIV.
The kingdom argues that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners who pose a risk to the economy or the security or the public health or the morals of the state.
But these laws, when applied to people living with HIV, are a violation of international human rights agreements to which these countries are signatories.
But you know what?
Matters of principle aside, practically speaking, these laws drive HIV underground.
People are less likely to come forth to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition, none of which helps these individuals or the communities these laws purport to protect.
Today we can prevent the transmission of HIV.
And with treatment, it is a manageable condition.
We are very far from the days when the only practical response to dread disease was to have banished the afflicted -- like this, "The Exile of the Leper."
So you tell me why, in our age of science, we still have laws and policies which come from an age of superstition.
Time for a quick show of hands.
Who here has been touched by HIV -- either because you yourself have the virus or you have a family member or a friend or a colleague who is living with HIV?
Hands up.
Wow. Wow.
That's a significant number of us.
You know better than anyone that HIV brings out the best and the worst in humanity.
And the laws reflect these attitudes.
I'm not just talking about laws on the books, but laws as they are enforced on the streets and laws as they are decided in the courts.
And I'm not just talking about laws as they relate to people living with HIV, but people who are at greatest risk of infection -- people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers or men who have sex with men or transgendered persons or migrants or prisoners.
And in many parts of the world that includes women and children who are especially vulnerable.
Now there are laws in many parts of the world which reflect the best of human nature.
These laws treat people touched by HIV with compassion and acceptance.
These laws respect universal human rights and they are grounded in evidence.
These laws ensure that people living with HIV and those at greatest risk are protected from violence and discrimination and that they get access to prevention and to treatment.
Unfortunately, these good laws are counter-balanced by a mass of really bad law -- law which is grounded in moral judgement and in fear and in misinformation, laws which specifically punish people living with HIV or those at greatest risk.
These laws fly in the face of science, and they are grounded in prejudice and in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition and a selective reading of religion.
But you know what? You don't have to take my word for it.
We're going to hear from two people who are on the sharp end of the law.
The first is Nick Rhoades. He's an American.
And he was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law on HIV transmission and exposure -- neither of which offense he actually committed.
Nick Rhoades: If something is against the law then that is telling society that is unacceptable, that's bad behavior.
And I think the severity of that punishment tells you how bad you are as a person.
You're a class B felon, lifetime sex offender.
You are a very, very, very bad person.
And you did a very, very, very bad thing.
And so that's just programmed into you.
And you go through the correctional system and everyone's telling you the same thing.
And you're just like, I'm a very bad person.
Shereen El-Feki: It's not just a question of unfair or ineffective laws.
Some countries have good laws, laws which could stem the tide of HIV.
The problem is that these laws are flouted.
Because stigma gives unofficial license to treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk unlike other citizens.
And this is exactly what happened to Helma and Dongo from Namibia.
Hilma: I found out when I went to the hospital for a pregnancy check-up.
The nurse announced that every pregnant woman must also be tested for HIV that day.
I took the test and the result showed I was positive.
That's the day I found out.
The nurse said to me, "Why should you people bcome pregnant when you know you are HIV positive?
Why are you pregnant when you are living positive?"
I am sure now that is the reason they sterilized me.
Because I am HIV positive.
They didn't give the forms to me or explain what was in the form.
The nurse just came with it already marked where I had to sign.
And with the labor pain, I didn't have the strength to ask them to read it to me.
I just signed.
SE: Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom are among the 34 million people living with HIV according to recent estimates.
They're the lucky ones because they're still alive.
According to those same estimates, in 2010 1.8 million people died of AIDS related causes.
These are terrible and tragic figures.
But if we look a little more broadly into the statistics, we actually see some reason for hope.
Looking globally, the number of new infections of HIV is declining.
And looking globally as well, deaths are also starting to fall.
There are many reasons for these positive developments, but one of the most remarkable is in the increase in the number of people around the world on anti-retroviral therapy, the medicines they need to keep their HIV in check.
Now there are still many problems.
Only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it.
In some parts of the world -- like here in the Middle East and North Africa -- new infections are rising and so are deaths.
And the money, the money we need for the global response to HIV, that is shrinking.
But for the first time in three decades into this epidemic we have a real chance to come to grips with HIV.
But in order to do that we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law.
It's for this reason that the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, of which I'm a member, was established by the agencies of the United Nations -- to look at the ways that legal environments are affecting people living with HIV and those at greatest risk, and to recommend what should be done to make the law an ally, not an enemy, of the global response to HIV.
Let me give you just one example of the way a legal environment can make a positive difference.
People who inject drugs are one of those groups I mentioned.
They're at high risk of HIV through contaminated injection equipment and other risk-related behaviors.
In fact, one in every 10 new infections of HIV is among people who inject drugs.
Now drug use or possession is illegal in almost every country.
But some countries take a harder line on this than others.
In Thailand people who use drugs, or are merely suspected of using drugs, are placed in detention centers, like the one you see here, where they are supposed to clean up.
There is absolutely no evidence to show that throwing people into detention cures their drug dependence.
There is, however, ample evidence to show that incarcerating people increases their risk of HIV and other infections.
We know how to reduce HIV transmission and other risks in people who inject drugs.
It's called harm reduction, and it involves, among other things, providing clean needles and syringes, offering opioid substitution therapy and other evidence-based treatments to reduce drug dependence.
It involves providing information and education and condoms to reduce HIV transmission, and also providing HIV testing and counseling and treatment should people become infected.
Where the legal environment allows for harm reduction the results are striking.
Australia and Switzerland were two countries which introduced harm reduction very early on in their HIV epidemics, and they have a very low rate of HIV among injecting drug users.
The U.S. and Malaysia came to harm reduction a little later, and they have higher rates of HIV in these populations.
Thailand and Russia, however, have resisted harm reduction and have stringent laws which punish drug use.
And hey, surprise, very high rates of HIV among people who are injecting drugs.
At the Global Commission we have studied the evidence, and we've heard the experiences of over 700 people from 140 countries.
And the trend? Well the trend is clear.
Where you criminalize people living with HIV or those at greatest risk, you fuel the epidemic.
Now coming up with a vaccine for HIV or a cure for AIDS -- now that's rocket science.
But changing the law isn't.
And in fact, a number of countries are starting to make progress on a number of points.
To begin, countries need to review their legislation as it touches HIV and vulnerable groups.
On the back of those reviews, governments should repeal laws that punish or discriminate against people living with HIV or those at greatest risk.
Repealing a law isn't easy, and it's particularly difficult when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex.
But there's plenty you can do while that process is underway.
One of the key points is to reform the police so that they have better practices on the ground.
So for example, outreach workers who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations are not themselves subject to police harassment or abuse or arbitrary arrest.
We can also train judges so that they find flexibilities in the law and so that they rule on the side of tolerance rather than prejudice.
We can retool prisons so that HIV prevention and harm reduction is available to prisoners.
The key to all this is reinforcing civil society.
Because civil society is key to raising awareness among vulnerable groups of their legal rights.
But awareness needs action.
And so we need to ensure that these people who are living with HIV or at greatest risk of HIV have access to legal services and they have equal access to the courts.
And also important is talking to communities so that we change interpretations of religious or customary law, which is too often used to justify punishment and fuel stigma.
For many of us here HIV is not an abstract threat.
It hits very close to home.
The law, on the other hand, can seem remote, arcane, the stuff of specialists, but it isn't.
Because for those of us who live in democracies, or in aspiring democracies, the law begins with us.
Laws that treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk with respect start with the way that we treat them ourselves: as equals.
If we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime, then that is the change we need to spread.
Thank you.

<description>There is an epidemic of HIV, and with it an epidemic of bad laws -- laws that effectively criminalize being HIV positive. At the TEDxSummit in Doha, Fellow Shereen El-Feki gives a forceful argument that these laws, based in stigma, are actually helping the disease spread.</description>

Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other -- Is that person dangerous? Are they attractive?
Are they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity?
We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them.
What's your name? Where are you from?
How old are you? What do you do?
Then we get more personal with it.
Have you ever had any diseases?
Have you ever been divorced?
Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now?
What are you into? Who are you into?
What gender do you like to sleep with?
I get it.
We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves.
We start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough to know what acceptance feels like.
We bond together based on anything that we can -- music preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on.
We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices.
Sometimes, though, just the question "what do you do?"
can feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it.
Because the categories, I've found, are too limiting.
The boxes are too narrow.
And this can get really dangerous.
So here's a disclaimer about me, though, before we get too deep into this.
I grew up in a very sheltered environment.
I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s, two blocks from the epicenter of punk music.
I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing.
Where I come from, if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind, you were the weirdo.
It was an unorthodox upbringing, but as a kid on the streets of New York, you learn how to trust your own instincts, you learn how to go with your own ideas.
So when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy.
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them.
They said they wouldn't let girls play.
So I went home, and I shaved my head, and I came back the next day and I said, "I'm a boy."
I mean, who knows, right?
When you're six, maybe you can do that.
I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn't.
I kept up the charade for eight years.
So this is me when I was 11.
I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called "Julian Po."
I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him.
See, I was also a child actor, which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity, because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy.
In fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl -- not my teachers at school, not my friends, not the directors that I worked with.
Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with.
When I would go to the bathroom, I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up.
At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me without outing myself.
It's worth mentioning though that I didn't hate my body or my genitalia.
I didn't feel like I was in the wrong body.
I felt like I was performing this elaborate act.
I wouldn't have qualified as transgender.
If my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy, they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty.
But in my particular case, I just woke up one day when I was 14, and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again.
Puberty had hit, and I had no idea what being a girl meant, and I was ready to figure out who I actually was.
When a kid behaves like I did, they don't exactly have to come out, right?
No one is exactly shocked.
But I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents.
When I was 15, and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love, it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl.
Three years later, when I fell in love with a man, neither of my parents batted an eyelash either.
See, it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn't ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point.
I was just allowed to be me, growing and changing in every moment.
So four, almost five years ago, Proposition 8, the great marriage equality debate, was raising a lot of dust around this country.
And at the time, getting married wasn't really something I spent a lot of time thinking about.
But I was struck by the fact that America, a country with such a tarnished civil rights record, could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly.
And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country, between places where people believed in it and places where people didn't.
And then, that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me.
If this was a war with two disparate sides, I, by default, fell on team gay, because I certainly wasn't 100 percent straight.
At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy, over-compensating, boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was, a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person.
I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls, much like myself, who fell kind of between-the-lines -- girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear, girls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish, girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees, girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything.
I loved these people, and I admired their freedom, but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television.
And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority, and in my own home country, based on one facet of my character.
I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen.
I was not an activist.
I wave no flags in my own life.
But I was plagued by this question: How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character?
How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else?
Were we even a group? What group?
And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination?
Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was?
And then it occurred to me, perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do.
It might give them pause.
Obviously I couldn't get 20 million people to the same dinner party, so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice, without any lighting, or without any manipulation of any kind on my part.
Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off.
For me, photography is not just about exposing film, it's about exposing the viewer to something new, a place they haven't gone before, but most importantly, to people that they might be afraid of.
Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant, far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures.
So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits, mugshots if you will.
And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight, which, if you don't know, is a limitless number of people.
So this was a very large undertaking, and to do it we needed some help.
So I ran out in the freezing cold, and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago.
And I took those photographs, and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help.
And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York.
And then we made this.
I'm iO Tillett Wright, and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City.
Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today.
My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who's anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way.
My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face.
"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."
It's written in the Declaration of Independence.
We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded.
There is no equality in the United States.
["What does equality mean to you?"] ["Marriage"] ["Freedom"] ["Civil rights"] ["Treat every person as you'd treat yourself"] It's when you don't have to think about it, simple as that.
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage.
Today in 29 states, more than half of this country, you can legally be fired just for your sexuality.
["Who is responsible for equality?"] I've heard hundreds of people give the same answer: "We are all responsible for equality."
So far we've shot 300 faces in New York City.
And we wouldn't have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign.
I want to take the project across the country.
I want to visit 25 American cities, and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people.
This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation.
I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being.
Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that.
Almost 85,000 people watched that video, and then they started emailing us from all over the country, asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces.
And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated.
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces.
That video was made in the spring of 2011, and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people.
I know that this is a talk, but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them.
Because if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary.
So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas, we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on.
Visibility really is key.
Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy.
Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family, you're far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it.
Of course, in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight, but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian.
Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths.
But here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting: Self Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us.
In fact, on the contrary, it highlights them.
It presents, not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings, but the complexities found within each individual person.
It wasn't that we had too many boxes, it was that we had too few.
At some point I realized that my mission to photograph "gays" was inherently flawed, because there were a million different shades of gay.
Here I was trying to help, and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid -- yet another box.
At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay.
And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me.
People didn't know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before.
Can you quantify your openness?
Once they got over the shock, though, by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks.
Of course, there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other, but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced.
I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as "Grey."
Let me be clear though -- and this is very important -- in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist.
And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative, because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice, I invite you to go out and try to be grey.
I'll take your picture just for trying.
What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional.
The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this: If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here, and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another, there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between.
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one.
Because, for example, if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior, where exactly do you draw the line?
Is it over here, by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far?
Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far?
Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen?
Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is.
After traveling so much and meeting so many people, let me tell you, there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race.
Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs, and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle, just being other than straight doesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common.
So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming, as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms, bus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers, perhaps in watching this procession of humanity, something interesting and useful will begin to happen.
Hopefully these categories, these binaries, these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away.
Because really, they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are.
What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity.
And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity.
At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights.
So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing, the right to adopt children, the right to marriage, the freedom to shop here, live here, buy here?
Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father, your neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president, your police woman or the fireman?
It's too late.
Because I already am all of those things.
We already are all of those things, and we always have been.
So please don't greet us as strangers, greet us as your fellow human beings, period.
Thank you.

<title>iO Tillett Wright: Fifty shades of gay</title>
<description>Artist iO Tillett Wright has photographed 2,000 people who consider themselves somewhere on the LGBTQ spectrum and asked many of them: Can you assign a percentage to how gay or straight you are? Most people, it turns out, consider themselves to exist in the gray areas of sexuality, not 100% gay or straight. Which presents a real problem when it comes to discrimination: Where do you draw the line? </description>
<keywords>United States,gender,inequality,photography,relationships</keywords>

The maxim, "Know thyself" has been around since the ancient Greeks.
Some attribute this golden world knowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras.
But the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first, because it's still sage advice, even today.
"Know thyself."
It's pithy almost to the point of being meaningless, but it rings familiar and true, doesn't it?
"Know thyself."
I understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems, or more exactly the confusions, of consciousness.
I've always been fascinated with knowing the self.
This fascination led me to submerge myself in art, study neuroscience and later to become a psychotherapist.
Today I combine all my passions as the CEO of InteraXon, a thought-controlled computing company.
My goal, quite simply, is to help people become more in tune with themselves.
I take it from this little dictum, "Know thyself."
If you think about it, this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species, isn't it?
I mean, it's self-awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind.
Today we're often too busy tending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves.
Under the deluge of minute-to-minute text conversations, emails, relentless exchange of media channels and passwords and apps and reminders and Tweets and tags, we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place: ourselves.
Much of the time we're transfixed by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves into the world.
And we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves.
We've cluttered ourselves up with all this.
And we feel like we have to get far, far away to a secluded retreat, leaving it all behind.
So we go far away to the top of a mountain, assuming that perching ourselves on a piece is bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter, the chaotic everyday, and find ourselves again.
But on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind, what are we really achieving?
It's really only a successful escape.
Think of the term we use, "Retreat."
This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle.
It means we've got to get out of here.
Is this how we feel about the pressures of our world, that in order to get inside ourselves, you have to run for the hills?
And the problem with escaping your day-to-day life is that you have to come home eventually.
So when you think about it, we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there.
And eventually that vacation's got to come to an end.
So my question to you is, can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape?
Can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self-awareness that we seek?
Can we live here and now in our wired web and still follow those ancient instructions, "Know thyself?"
I say the answer is yes.
And I'm here today to share a new way that we're working with technology to this end to get familiar with our inner self like never before -- humanizing technology and furthering that age-old quest of ours to more fully know the self.
It's called thought-controlled computing.
You may or may not have noticed that I'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead.
This is actually a brainwave sensor that's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk.
These brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph.
Let me show you what it looks like.
That blue line there is my brainwave.
It's the direct signal being recorded from my head, rendered in real time.
The green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency, with lower frequencies here and higher frequencies up here.
You're actually looking inside my head as I speak.
These graphs are compelling, they're undulating, but from a human's perspective, they're actually not very useful.
That's why we've spent a lot of time thinking about how to make this data meaningful to the people who use it.
For instance, what if I could use this data to find out how relaxed I am at any moment?
Or what if I can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen?
The shape on the right over here has become an indicator of what's going on in my head.
The more relaxed I am, the more the energy's going to fall through it.
I may also be interested in knowing how focused I am, so I can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side.
And the more focused my brain is, the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy.
Ordinarily, I would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed I was in any tangible way.
As we know, our feelings about how we're feeling are notoriously unreliable.
We've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it until we lost it on someone who didn't deserve it, and then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves a little earlier.
This new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves.
We're trying to create technology that uses the insights to make our work more efficient, our breaks more relaxing and our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever.
I'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit, but first I want to take a look at how we got here.
By the way, feel free to check in on my head at any time.
My team at InteraXon and I have been developing throught-controlled application for almost a decade now.
In the first phase of development we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind.
We were making things activate, light up and work just by thinking.
We were transcending the space between the mind and the device.
We brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with your mind, like thought-controlled home appliances or slot car games or video games or a levitating chair.
We created technology and applications that engaged people's imaginations, and it was really exciting.
And then we were asked to do something really big for the Olympics.
We were invited to create a massive installation at the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics, were used in Vancouver, got to control the lighting on the C.N. Tower, the Canadian Parliament buildings and Niagara Falls from all the way across the country using their minds.
Over 17 days at the Olympics 7,000 visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the C.N. Tower, parliament and Niagara in real time with their minds from across the country, 3,000 km away.
So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool.
But we're always interested in multi-tiered levels of human interaction.
And so we began looking into inventing thought-controlled applications in a more complex frame than just control.
And that was responsiveness.
We realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you.
And it could join into the relationship with you.
We created the responsive room where the lights music and blinds adjusted to your state.
They followed these little shifts in your mental activity.
So as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day, on the couch in our office, the music would mellow with you.
When you read, the desk lamp would get brighter.
If you nod off, the system would know, dimming to darkness as you do.
We then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you, there's an even more valuable application than that.
That you could know something about yourself.
We could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible and come to see things that were previously hidden.
Let me show you an example of what I'm talking about here.
Here's an application that I created for the iPad.
So the goal of the original game Zen Bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form.
So you use it with your headset.
The headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone.
In that headset you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear.
In the original Zen Bound game, you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad.
In the game that we created, of course, you control the wooden form that's on the screen there with your mind.
As you focus on the wooden form, it rotates.
The more you focus, the faster the rotation.
This is for real.
This is not a fake.
What's really interesting to me though is at the end of the game you get stats and feedback about how you did.
You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing -- not just how much rope you used or what your high score is, but what was going on inside of your mind.
And this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves.
I like to call this "intra-active."
Normally we think about technology as interactive.
This technology is intra-active.
It understands what's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information to move you forward.
So you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop.
At InteraXon, intra-active technology is one of our really defining mandates.
It's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop.
For example, thought-controlled computing can teach children with ADD how to improve their focus.
With ADD, children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states and a high proportion of theta states.
So you can create applications that reward focused brain states.
So you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their ADD symptoms as they do it.
This can be as effective as Ritalin.
Perhaps even more importantly, thought-controlled computing can give children with ADD insights into their own fluctuating mental states, so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs.
The way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with.
We can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us, what once mystified and separated us.
Brainwave technology can understand us, anticipate our emotions and find the best solutions for our needs.
Imagine this collected awareness of the individual computed and reflected across an entire lifespan.
Imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight.
It would be like plugging into your own personal Google.
On the subject of Google, today you can search and tag images based on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them.
You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy, or whatever baby animals are to you, and then you can search that database, navigating with your feelings, rather than the keywords that just hint at them.
Or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention, just like this.
Humanizing technology is about taking what's already natural about the human-tech experience and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it.
As it aligns with our human behaviors, it can allow us to make better sense of what we do and, more importantly, why, creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are.
With humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles.
When our productivity starts to slacken, we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play.
Do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self, what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk?
Imagine if you had access to data that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness which people in your life made you the happiest, or what activities brought you joy.
Would you make more time for those people? Would you prioritize?
Would you get a divorce?
What thought-controlled computing can allow you to do is build colorful layered pictures of our lives.
And with this, we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings and build a story of our behaviors over time.
We can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward and tell us about what's going on.
And from this, we can learn how to change the plot, the outcome and the character of our personal stories.
Two millennia ago, those Greeks had some powerful insights.
They knew that a fundamental piece falls into place when you start to live out their little phrase, when you come into contact with yourself.
They understood the power of human narrative and the value that we place on humans as changing, evolving and growing.
But they understood something more fundamental -- the sheer joy in discovery, the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it, the richness that we get from seeing, feeling and knowing the lives that we are.
My mom's an artist, and as a child I'd often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush.
One moment it was all white space, pure possibility.
The next, it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions.
As I sat easel-side, watching her transform canvas after canvas, I learned that you could create your own world.
I learned that our own inner worlds -- our ideas, emotions and imaginations -- were, in fact, not bound by our brains and bodies.
If you could think it, if you could discover it, you could bring it to life.
To me, thought-controlled computing is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush -- one more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us.
I look forward to the day that I can sit beside you, easel-side, watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves.
Thank you.

In two weeks time, that's the ninth anniversary of the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed "Jeopardy" set.
I mean, nine years is a long time.
And given "Jeopardy's" average demographics, I think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead.
But not all, a few are still alive.
Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever.
And when I do, it's as a bit of a know-it-all.
I think that ship has sailed, it's too late for me.
For better or for worse, that's what I'm going to be known as, as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff.
And I can't complain about this.
I feel like that was always sort of my destiny, although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet.
If nothing else, you realize very quickly as a teenager, it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name.
And as a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years.
But if you go further back, if you look at it, it's all there.
I was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad with whatever great fact I had just read about -- Haley's comet or giant squids or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was.
I now have a 10-year-old of my own who's exactly the same.
And I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work.
And I loved game shows, fascinated with game shows.
I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979 because it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school, that I was also going to miss "Hollywood Squares" and "Family Feud."
I was going to miss my game shows.
And later, in the mid-'80s, when "Jeopardy" came back on the air, I remember running home from school every day to watch the show.
It was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house.
And we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working, where there was only one English language TV channel.
There was Armed Forces TV, and if you didn't speak Korean, that's what you were watching.
So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch "Jeopardy."
I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid.
I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80s and holding my own, back when that was a fad.
There's a weird sense of mastery you get You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know.
And you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power -- the right fact deployed at exactly the right place.
I never had a guidance counselor who thought this was a legitimate career path, that thought you could major in trivia or be a professional ex-game show contestant.
And so I sold out way too young.
I didn't try to figure out what one does with that.
I studied computers because I heard that was the thing, and I became a computer programmer -- not an especially good one, not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on "Jeopardy" in 2004.
But that's what I was doing.
And it made it doubly ironic -- my computer background -- a few years later, I think 2009 or so, when I got another phone call from "Jeopardy" saying, "It's early days yet, but IBM tells us they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.' Are you up for this?"
This was the first I'd heard of it.
And of course I said yes, for several reasons.
One, because playing "Jeopardy" is a great time.
It's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on.
And I would do it for nothing.
I don't think they know that, luckily, but I would go back and play for Arby's coupons.
I just love "Jeopardy," and I always have.
And second of all, because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future.
People playing computers on game shows was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future, and now I could be on the stage with it.
I was not going to say no.
The third reason I said yes is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win.
I had taken some artificial intelligence classes.
I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on "Jeopardy."
People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a "Jeopardy" clue in a natural language like English and understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings, unpack the meaning of the clue.
The kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human, little kid could do, very hard for a computer.
And I thought, well this is going to be child's play.
Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species.
But as the years went on, as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this, I started to get occasional updates from them, and I started to get a little more worried.
I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph.
It was a scatter chart showing performance on "Jeopardy," tens of thousands of dots representing "Jeopardy" champions up at the top with their performance plotted on number of -- I was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess, clues responded to -- versus the accuracy of those answers.
So there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to.
And at first, it was very low.
There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena.
But then you see the line start to go up.
And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud.
And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart some darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color.
And thought, what are these?
"The black dots in the upper right represent 74-time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings."
And I saw this line coming for me.
And I realized, this is it.
This is what it looks like when the future comes for you.
It's not the Terminator's gun sight; it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do, the only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at.
And when the game eventually happened about a year later, it was very different than the "Jeopardy" games I'd been used to.
We were not playing in L.A. on the regular "Jeopardy" set.
Watson does not travel.
Watson's actually huge.
It's thousands of processors, a terabyte of memory, trillions of bytes of memory.
We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room.
The only other "Jeopardy" contestant to this day I've ever been inside.
And so Watson does not travel.
You must come to it; you must make the pilgrimage.
So me and the other human player wound up at this secret IBM research lab in the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County to play the computer.
And we realized right away that the computer had a big home court advantage.
There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage.
Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls, and there's the thing in the middle of their court.
And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers cheering on their little darling, having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up, and holding up "Go Watson" signs and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right.
I think guys had "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their bellies in grease paint.
If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their gut, it's an unpleasant sight.
But they were right. They were exactly right.
I don't want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR, but Watson won handily.
And I remember standing there behind the podium as I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking.
It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer.
And you could hear that little tick, tick, tick, tick.
And I remember thinking, this is it.
I felt obsolete.
I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line.
I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers.
And it hasn't been the last.
If you watch the news, you'll see occasionally -- and I see this all the time -- that pharmacists now, there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist.
And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals because there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions.
You don't need human assistants for that anymore.
I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score from a baseball or football game and it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game and was commenting on it.
And obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a job as the humans they're replacing, but they're faster, and crucially, they're much, much cheaper.
So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be.
I've read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies, we'll enter a new golden age of leisure when we'll all have time for the things we really love because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren.
I've heard other people say quite the opposite, that this is yet another tier of the middle class that's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology and that this is actually something ominous, something that we should worry about.
I'm not an economist myself.
All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work.
And it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible.
Here's the one thing that I was ever good at, and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and they could do the same thing.
They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV, and "I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore."
And it made me think, what does this mean, if we're going to be able to start outsourcing, not just lower unimportant brain functions.
I'm sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends' phone numbers.
And suddenly there was a machine that did that, and now we don't need to remember that anymore.
I have read that there's now actually evidence that the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships, physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like GPS, because we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore.
We're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard.
And as a result, a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuff gets smaller and dumber.
And it made me think, what happens when computers are now better at knowing and remembering stuff than we are?
Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that?
Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less?
As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know, this was a terrifying idea to me.
The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important.
The things we know are still important.
I came to believe there were two advantages that those of us who have these things in our head have over somebody who says, "Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second."
There's an advantage of volume, and there's an advantage of time.
The advantage of volume, first, just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays.
There's so much information out there.
Being a Renaissance man or woman, that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance.
Now it's really not possible to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor.
There's just too much.
They say that the scope of human information is now doubling every 18 months or so, the sum total of human information.
That means between now and late 2014, we will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes, as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together.
It's doubling every 18 months now.
This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts.
A decision like where do I go to school? What should I major in?
Who do I vote for?
Do I take this job or that one?
These are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts.
If we have those facts at our mental fingertips, we're going to be able to make informed decisions.
If, on the other hand, we need to look them all up, we may be in trouble.
According to a National Geographic survey I just saw, somewhere along the lines of 80 percent of the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy cannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map.
If you can't do that first step, are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know to master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy?
Quite probably not.
At some point you're just going to be like, "You know what? There's too much to know. Screw it."
And you'll make a less informed decision.
The other issue is the advantage of time that you have if you have all these things at your fingertips.
I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith.
She was a 10-year-old girl from Surrey, England on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand.
She runs up to them on the beach one morning and says, "Mom, Dad, we've got to get off the beach."
And they say, "What do you mean? We just got here."
And she said, "In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month, he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea and you see the waves churning way out there, that's the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach."
What would you do if your 10-year-old daughter came up to you with this?
Her parents thought about it, and they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her.
They told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel, and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily, because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami, the day after Christmas, 2004, that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean.
But not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach, because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before.
Now when facts come in handy like that -- I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact, one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time -- normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.
But in this case it happened in real life.
And it happens in real life all the time.
It's not always a tsunami, often it's a social situation.
It's a meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge.
You say where you're from, and I say, "Oh, yeah."
Or your alma mater or your job, and I know just a little something about it, enough to get the ball rolling.
People love that shared connection that gets created when somebody knows something about you.
It's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met.
That's often the advantage of time.
And it's not effective if you say, "Well, hold on.
You're from Fargo, North Dakota. Let me see what comes up.
Oh, yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo."
That doesn't work. That's just annoying.
The great 18th-century British theologian and thinker, friend of Dr. Johnson, Samuel Parr once said, "It's always better to know a thing than not to know it."
And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed, it's probably that.
I have always believed that the things we know -- that knowledge is an absolute good, that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are, as individuals and as a species.
I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete.
I don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty, so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization together.
I don't want to be the last trivia know-it-all sitting on a mountain somewhere, reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of "Simpsons" episodes and the lyrics of Abba songs.
I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices, to our search engines and our smartphones.
In the movies, when computers like Watson start to think, things don't always end well.
Those movies are never about beautiful utopias.
It's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in "2001."
Things always go terribly wrong.
And I feel like we're sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in.
This is a question of leadership, because it becomes a question of who leads the future.
On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it's ever been in human history, where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips.
And on the other hand, we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore, that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud, and why would we ever bother learning anything new.
Those are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in.
And we can all make that choice.
We make that choice by being curious, inquisitive people who like to learn, who don't just say, "Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over, I don't have to learn anymore," or "Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime.
I don't have to learn new things anymore."
No, every day we should be striving to learn something new.
We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us.
That's where the people you see on "Jeopardy" come from.
These know-it-alls, they're not Rainman-style savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book.
I've met a lot of them.
For the most part, they are just normal folks who are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything, thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject.
We can live in one of these two worlds.
We can live in a world where our brains, the things that we know, continue to be the thing that makes us special, or a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson.
Ladies and gentlemen, the choice is yours.
Thank you very much.

<title>Ken Jennings: Watson, Jeopardy and me, the obsolete know-it-all</title>
<description>Trivia whiz Ken Jennings has made a career as a keeper of facts; he holds the longest winning streak in history on the U.S. game show &lt;em&gt;Jeopardy&lt;/em&gt;. But in 2011, he played a challenge match against supercomputer Watson -- and lost. With humor and humility, Jennings tells us how it felt to have a computer literally beat him at his own game, and also makes the case for good old-fashioned human knowledge. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>
<keywords>computers,entertainment,robots,technology</keywords>

I'm going to begin by reciting a poem.
"Oh beloved dentist: Your rubber fingers in my mouth ...
your voice so soft and muffled ...
Lower the mask, dear dentist, lower the mask."
Okay, in this presentation, I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains through a fairly serious workout.
You're going to see a lot of imagery, and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about, so I need you to kind of split your brains in half and let the images flow over one side and listen to me on the other.
So I am one of those people with a transformative personal story.
Six years ago, after 20 years in graphic design and typography, I changed the way I was working and the way most graphic designers work to pursue a more personal approach to my work, with only the humble attempt to simply make a living doing something that I loved.
But something weird happened.
I became bizarrely popular.
My current work seems to resonate with people in a way that has so taken me by surprise that I still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on.
And I'm slowly coming to understand that the appeal of what I do may be connected to why I do it.
These days, I call myself a graphic artist.
So where my work as a graphic designer was to follow strategy, my work now follows my heart and my interests with the guidance of my ego to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client.
Now, this is heresy in the design world.
The ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design.
But I find that for myself, without exception, the more I deal with the work as something of my own, as something that is personal, the more successful it is as something that's compelling, interesting and sustaining.
So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream of design thinking.
Where others might look at measurable results, I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities, like "Does it bring joy?"
"Is there a sense of wonder?"
and "Does it invoke curiosity?"
This is a scientific diagram, by the way.
I don't have time to explain it, but it has to do with DNA and RNA.
So I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work.
The things that interest me when I'm working are visual structure, surprise and anything that requires figuring things out.
So for this reason, I'm particularly drawn to systems and patterns.
I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works.
This is a piece that I did for The Guardian newspaper in the U.K.
They have a magazine that they call G2.
And this is for their puzzle special in 2007.
And puzzling it is.
I started by creating a series of tiling units.
And these tiling units, I designed specifically so that they would contain parts of letterforms within their shapes so that I could then join those pieces together to create letters and then words within the abstract patterning.
But then as well, I was able to just flip them, rotate them and combine them in different ways to create either regular patterns or abstract patterns.
So here's the word puzzle again.
And here it is with the abstract surrounding.
And as you can see, it's extremely difficult to read.
But all I have to do is fill certain areas of those letterforms and I can bring those words out of the background pattern.
But maybe that's a little too obvious.
So then I can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves, and this way, working with the art director, I'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience -- they can figure out that there's something they have to read -- but it's not impossible for them to read.
I'm also interested in working with unusual materials and common materials in unusual ways.
So this requires figuring out how to get the most out of something's innate properties and also how to bend it to my will.
So ultimately, my goal is to create something unexpected.
To this end, I have worked in sugar for Stefan Sagmeister, three-time TED speaker.
And this project began essentially on my kitchen table.
I've been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life.
And for that same amount of time, I've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers.
And eventually I used this technique to create a piece of artwork.
And then I used it again to create six pieces for Stefan's book, "Things in My Life I've Learned So Far."
And these were created without sketches, just freehand, by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then manipulating it to get the words and designs out of it.
Recently, I've also made some rather highbrow baroque borders out of lowbrow pasta.
And this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book, and the chapter is on honor.
So it's a little bit unexpected, but, in a way, it refers to the macaroni art that children make for their parents or they make in school and give to their parents, which is in itself a form of honor.
This is what you can do with some household tinfoil.
Okay, well, it's what I can do with some household tinfoil.
I'm very interested in wonder, in design as an impetus to inquiring.
To say I wonder is to say I question, I ask.
And to experience wonder is to experience awe.
So I'm currently working on a book, which plays with both senses of the word, as I explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock-like grandeur.
The world is full of wonder.
But the world of graphic design, for the most part, is not.
So I'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of seductive force.
I think that one of the things that religions got right was the use of visual wonder to deliver a message.
I think this true marriage of art and information is woefully underused in adult literature, and I'm mystified as to why visual wealth is not more commonly used to enhance intellectual wealth.
When we look at works like this, we tend to associate them with children's literature.
There's an implication that ornamental graphics detract from the seriousness of the content.
But I really hope to have the opportunity to change that perception.
This book is taking rather a long time, but I'm nearly done.
For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission in my talk.
And this is it -- just to give you and me a moment to catch up.
So I do these valentines.
I've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since 2005.
These are my valentines from 2005 and 2006.
And I started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person.
But in 2007, I got the cockamamie idea to hand-draw each valentine for everyone on my mailing list.
I reduced my mailing list to 150 people.
And I drew each person their own unique valentine and put their name on it and numbered it and signed it and sent it out.
Believe it or not, I devised this as a timesaving method.
I was very busy in the beginning of that year, and I didn't know when I was going to find time to design and print a single valentine.
And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal as I was traveling.
It didn't exactly work out that way.
There's a longer story to this, but I did get them all done in time, and they were extremely well received.
I got an almost 100 percent response rate.
And those who didn't respond will never receive anything from me ever again.
Last year, I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine.
I had this idea that I wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter, like a found fragment in their mailbox.
I wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me, something that caused them to wonder what on Earth this thing was.
And I specifically wrote four pages that don't connect.
There were four different versions of this.
And I wrote them so that they begin in the middle of a sentence, end in the middle of a sentence.
And they're on the one hand, universal, so I avoid specific names or places, but on the other hand, they're personal.
So I wanted people to really get the sense that they had received something that could have been a love letter to them.
And I'm just going to read one of them to you.
"You've never really been sure of this, but I can assure you that this quirk you're so self-conscious of is intensely endearing.
Just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile, and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing.
Time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds, but without the scratches and bird shit."
"That is to say, your thoughts and words flit and dart, disconcertedly elusive at times, but when caught and examined -- ahh, such a wonder, such a delightful reward.
There's no passing time with you, only collecting -- the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation and at the same time release.
Impossible? I don't think so.
I know this makes you embarrassed.
I'm certain I can see you blushing.
But I just have to tell you because sometimes I hear your self-doubt, and it's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are, how inspiring and delightful and really, truly the most completely ..."
So Valentine's Day is coming up in a couple of days, and these are currently arriving in mailboxes all around the world.
This year, I got, what I really have to say is a rather brilliant idea, to laser cut my valentines out of used Christmas cards.
So I solicited friends to send me their used Christmas cards, and I made 500 of these.
Each one of them is completely different.
I'm just really, really thrilled with them.
I don't have that much else to say, but they turned out really well.
I do spend a lot of time on my work.
And one of the things that I've been thinking about recently is what is worth while.
What is it that's worth spending my time on and my life on in this way?
Working in the commercial world, this is something that I do have to struggle with at times.
And yes, sometimes I'm swayed by money.
But ultimately, I don't consider that a worthy goal.
What makes something worthwhile for me is the people I work for or with, the conditions I work under and the audience that I'm able to reach.
So I might ask: "Who is it for?"
"What does it say?"
and "What does it do?"
You know, I have to tell you, it's really difficult for someone like me to come up on stage at this conference with these unbelievably brilliant minds, who are thinking these really big-picture, world-changing, life-changing ideas and technologies.
And it's very, very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we're not contributing enough, or worse, that all we're doing is contributing to landfill.
Here I am; I'm showing you some pretty visuals and talking about aesthetics.
But I've come to believe that truly imaginative visual work is extremely important in society.
Just in the way that I'm inspired by books and magazines of all kinds, conversations I have, movies, so I also think, when I put visual work out there into the mass media, work that is interesting, unusual, intriguing, work that maybe opens up that sense of inquiry in the mind, that I'm seeding the imagination of the populace.
And you just never know who is going to take something from that and turn it into something else, because inspiration is cross-pollinating.
So a piece of mine may inspire a playwright or a novelist or a scientist, and that in turn may be the seed that inspires a doctor or a philanthropist or a babysitter.
And this isn't something that you can quantify or track or measure, and we tend to undervalue things in society that we can't measure.
But I really believe that a fully operating, rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing.
So that's why I do what I do, and why I spend so much time and effort on it, and why I work in the commercial, public sphere, as opposed to the isolated, private sphere of fine art: because I want as many people as possible to see my work, notice it, be drawn into it, and be able to take something from it.
And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this Earth in this way.
And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you.

I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials.
I brought along with me an abalone shell.
This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that's 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein.
Yet, it's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart.
And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells, like chalk.
I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials, and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job.
Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure, but they're formed at the nanoscale.
They're formed at the nanoscale, and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures.
So something I think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non-living structures, like batteries and like solar cells?
What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did, in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure, using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment?
So that's the vision that I've been thinking about.
And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish?
Or, what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time, and do so in an environmentally friendly way?
And so, going back to this abalone shell, besides being nano-structured, one thing that's fascinating, is when a male and a female abalone get together, they pass on the genetic information that says, "This is how to build an exquisite material.
Here's how to do it at room temperature and pressure, using non-toxic materials."
Same with diatoms, which are shown right here, which are glasseous structures.
Every time the diatoms replicate, they give the genetic information that says, "Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nano-structured.
And you can do it the same, over and over again."
So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery?
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old.
But anyone who's ever had, or knows, small children knows they're incredibly complex organisms.
And so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don't want to do, it's very difficult.
So when we think about future technologies, we actually think of using bacteria and virus, simple organisms.
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox, so that they can build a structure that will be important to me?
Also, when we think about future technologies, we start with the beginning of Earth.
Basically, it took a billion years to have life on Earth.
And very rapidly, they became multi-cellular, they could replicate, they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source.
But it wasn't until about 500 million years ago -- during the Cambrian geologic time period -- that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials.
Before that, they were all soft, fluffy structures.
And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment, and organisms learned how to make hard materials.
And so that's what I would like be able to do -- convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table.
Now if you look at biology, there's many structures like DNA and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you've heard about that are already nano-structured.
So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale.
What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV?
But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us?
So here are some examples: these are some natural shells.
There are natural biological materials.
The abalone shell here -- and if you fracture it, you can look at the fact that it's nano-structured.
There's diatoms made out of SIO2, and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small, single-domain magnets used for navigation.
What all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale, and they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures.
Now, going back to the abalone shell, the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins.
These proteins are very negatively charged.
And they can pull calcium out of the environment, put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.
It has the chemical sequences of amino acids, which says, "This is how to build the structure.
Here's the DNA sequence, here's the protein sequence in order to do it."
And so an interesting idea is, what if you could take any material that you wanted, or any element on the periodic table, and find its corresponding DNA sequence, then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure, but not build an abalone shell -- build something that, through nature, it has never had the opportunity to work with yet.
And so here's the periodic table.
And I absolutely love the periodic table.
Every year for the incoming freshman class at MIT, I have a periodic table made that says, "Welcome to MIT. Now you're in your element."
And you flip it over, and it's the amino acids with the PH at which they have different charges.
And so I give this out to thousands of people.
And I know it says MIT, and this is Caltech, but I have a couple extra if people want it.
And I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year on his visit to MIT, and I really wanted to give him a periodic table.
So I stayed up at night, and I talked to my husband, "How do I give President Obama a periodic table?
What if he says, 'Oh, I already have one,' or, 'I've already memorized it'?"
And so he came to visit my lab and looked around -- it was a great visit.
And then afterward, I said, "Sir, I want to give you the periodic table in case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight."
And I thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass.
And so he looked at it, and he said, "Thank you. I'll look at it periodically."
And later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy, he pulled it out and said, "And people at MIT, they give out periodic tables."
So basically what I didn't tell you is that about 500 million years ago, organisms starter making materials, but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it.
It took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell.
And that's a hard sell to a graduate student.
"I have this great project -- 50 million years."
And so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly.
And so we use a virus that's a non-toxic virus called M13 bacteriophage that's job is to infect bacteria.
Well it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it.
And by doing that, it allows the virus to express random protein sequences.
And this is pretty easy biotechnology.
And you could basically do this a billion times.
And so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical, but they differ from each other based on their tips, on one sequence that codes for one protein.
Now if you take all billion viruses, and you can put them in one drop of liquid, you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table.
And through a process of selection evolution, you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you'd like it to do, like grow a battery or grow a solar cell.
So basically, viruses can't replicate themselves; they need a host.
Once you find that one out of a billion, you infect it into a bacteria, and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence.
And so the other thing that's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales.
And these viruses are long and skinny, and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries.
Now this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab.
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes.
So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube.
The other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery.
And then it wires itself to the current collector.
And so through a process of selection evolution, we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking, high-powered battery that's all made at room temperature, basically at the bench top.
And that battery went to the White House for a press conference.
I brought it here.
You can see it in this case -- that's lighting this LED.
Now if we could scale this, you could actually use it to run your Prius, which is my dream -- to be able to drive a virus-powered car.
But it's basically -- you can pull one out of a billion.
You can make lots of amplifications to it.
Basically, you make an amplification in the lab, and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery.
We're able to do this also with catalysis.
This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water.
And what we've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye-absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna, and you get an energy transfer across the virus.
And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels.
And I brought an example with me of that today.
My students promised me it would work.
These are virus-assembled nanowires.
When you shine light on them, you can see them bubbling.
In this case, you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out.
And basically, by controlling the genes, you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance.
The last example are solar cells.
You can also do this with solar cells.
We've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them -- and use as a way of getting electrons through the device.
And what we've found is through genetic engineering, we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems.
And I brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward.
So this is a virus-based solar cell.
Through evolution and selection, we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell.
So I hope that I've convinced you that there's a lot of great, interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials -- and taking it the next step to see if you can force, or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials, to make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making.
Thank you.

And that's Johnny Depp's famous shoulder tattoo.
Some of you might know that, in 1990, Depp got engaged to Winona Ryder, and he had tattooed on his right shoulder "Winona forever."
And then three years later -- which in fairness, kind of is forever by Hollywood standards -- they broke up, and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done.
And now his shoulder says, "Wino forever."
So like Johnny Depp, and like 25 percent of Americans between the ages of 16 and 50, I have a tattoo.
I first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s, but I deliberately waited a really long time.
Because we all know people who have gotten tattoos when they were 17 or 19 or 23 and regretted it by the time they were 30.
That didn't happen to me.
I got my tattoo when I was 29, and I regretted it instantly.
And by "regretted it," I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place -- this is just a couple miles from here down on the Lower East Side -- and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street.
Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares.
And then I went home that night, and I had an even larger emotional meltdown, which I'll say more about in a minute.
And this was all actually quite shocking to me, because prior to this moment, I had prided myself on having absolutely no regrets.
I made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions, of course.
I do that hourly.
But I had always felt like, look, you know, I made the best choice I could make given who I was then, given the information I had on hand.
I learned a lesson from it.
It somehow got me to where I am in life right now.
And okay, I wouldn't change it.
In other words, I had drunk our great cultural Kool-Aid about regret, which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past is an absolute waste of time, that we should always look forward and not backward, and that one of the noblest and best things we can do is strive to live a life free of regrets.
This idea is nicely captured by this quote: "Things without all remedy should be without regard; what's done is done."
And it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first -- something we might all agree to sign onto ...
until I tell you who said it.
Right, so this is Lady MacBeth basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss for feeling bad about murdering people.
And as it happens, Shakespeare was onto something here, as he generally was.
Because the inability to experience regret is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics of sociopaths.
It's also, by the way, a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage.
So people who have damage to their orbital frontal cortex seem to be unable to feel regret in the face of even obviously very poor decisions.
So if, in fact, you want to live a life free of regret, there is an option open to you.
It's called a lobotomy.
But if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane, I think you need to learn to live, not without regret, but with it.
So let's start off by defining some terms.
What is regret?
Regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past.
So in other words, regret requires two things.
It requires, first of all, agency -- we had to make a decision in the first place.
And second of all, it requires imagination.
We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice, and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present.
And in fact, the more we have of either of these things -- the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret, the more acute that regret will be.
So let's say for instance that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic, and you finally arrive at your gate and you've missed your flight.
You're going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by 20.
Why?
Well because, if you miss your flight by three minutes, it is painfully easy to imagine that you could have made different decisions that would have led to a better outcome.
"I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel.
I should have gone through that yellow light."
These are the classic conditions that create regret.
We feel regret when we think we are responsible for a decision that came out badly, but almost came out well.
Now within that framework, we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things.
This session today is about behavioral economics.
And most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain.
We have a vast body of literature on consumer and financial decisions and the regrets associated with them -- buyer's remorse, basically.
But then finally, it occurred to some researchers to step back and say, well okay, but overall, what do we regret most in life?
Here's what the answers turn out to look like.
So top six regrets -- the things we regret most in life: Number one by far, education.
33 percent of all of our regrets pertain to decisions we made about education.
We wish we'd gotten more of it.
We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have.
We wish we'd chosen to study a different topic.
Others very high on our list of regrets include career, romance, parenting, various decisions and choices about our sense of self and how we spend our leisure time -- or actually more specifically, how we fail to spend our leisure time.
The remaining regrets pertain to these things: finance, family issues unrelated to romance or parenting, health, friends, spirituality and community.
So in other words, we know most of what we know about regret by the study of finance.
But it turns out, when you look overall at what people regret in life, you know what, our financial decisions don't even rank.
They account for less than three percent of our total regrets.
So if you're sitting there stressing about large cap versus small cap, or company A versus company B, or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius, you know what, let it go.
Odds are, you're not going to care in five years.
But for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around, what does that experience feel like?
We all know the short answer.
It feels terrible. Regret feels awful.
But it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways.
So the first consistent component of regret is basically denial.
When I went home that night after getting my tattoo, I basically stayed up all night.
And for the first several hours, there was exactly one thought in my head.
And the thought was, "Make it go away!"
This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response.
I mean, it's right up there with, "I want my mommy!"
We're not trying to solve the problem.
We're not trying to understand how the problem came about.
We just want it to vanish.
The second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment.
So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night was, "How could I have done that?
What was I thinking?"
This real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret.
We can't identify with that part.
We don't understand that part.
And we certainly don't have any empathy for that part -- which explains the third consistent component of regret, which is an intense desire to punish ourselves.
That's why, in the face of our regret, the thing we consistently say is, "I could have kicked myself."
The fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative.
To perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing.
Now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop.
So it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night, thinking, "Make it go away."
It's that I sat there and I thought, "Make it go away. Make it go away.
Make it go away. Make it go away."
So if you look at the psychological literature, these are the four consistent defining components of regret.
But I want to suggest that there's also a fifth one.
And I think of this as a kind of existential wake-up call.
That night in my apartment, after I got done kicking myself and so forth, I lay in bed for a long time, and I thought about skin grafts.
And then I thought about how, much as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God, probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy.
In point of fact, no insurance covers acts of idiocy.
The whole point of acts of idiocy is that they leave you totally uninsured; they leave you exposed to the world and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility in face of, frankly, a fairly indifferent universe.
This is obviously an incredibly painful experience.
And I think it's particularly painful for us now in the West in the grips of what I sometimes think of as a Control-Z culture -- Control-Z like the computer command, undo.
We're incredibly used to not having to face life's hard realities, in a certain sense.
We think we can throw money at the problem or throw technology at the problem -- we can undo and unfriend and unfollow.
And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change and we cannot.
Sometimes instead of Control-Z, we actually have zero control.
And for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists -- and I know where of I speak -- this is really hard, because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right.
Now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos, and I'm going to return to that point in a few minutes.
But first I want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about.
So for instance, here's one of my favorite automatic generators of regret in modern life.
Text: Relpy to all.
And the amazing thing about this really insidious technological innovation is that even just with this one thing, we can experience a huge range of regret.
You can accidentally hit "reply all" to an email and torpedo a relationship.
Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work.
Or you can have your last day at work.
And this doesn't even touch on the really profound regrets of a life.
Because of course, sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences, either for our own or for other people's health and happiness and livelihoods, and in the very worst case scenario, even their lives.
Now obviously, those kinds of regrets are incredibly piercing and enduring.
I mean, even the stupid "reply all" regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days.
So how are we supposed to live with this?
I want to suggest that there's three things that help us to make our peace with regret.
And the first of these is to take some comfort in its universality.
If you Google regret and tattoo, you will get 11.5 million hits.
The FDA estimates that of all the Americans who have tattoos, 17 percent of us regret getting them.
That is Johnny Depp and me and our seven million friends.
And that's just regret about tattoos.
We are all in this together.
The second way that we can help make our peace with regret is to laugh at ourselves.
Now in my case, this really wasn't a problem, because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're 29 years old and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo.
But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion when it comes to these more profound regrets.
I don't think that's the case though.
All of us who've experienced regret that contains real pain and real grief understand that humor and even black humor plays a crucial role in helping us survive.
It connects the poles of our lives back together, the positive and the negative, and it sends a little current of life back into us.
The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret is through the passage of time, which, as we know, heals all wounds -- except for tattoos, which are permanent.
So it's been several years since I got my own tattoo.
And do you guys just want to see it?
All right.
Actually, you know what, I should warn you, you're going to be disappointed.
Because it's actually not that hideous.
I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something.
When other people see my tattoo, for the most part they like how it looks.
It's just that I don't like how it looks.
And as I said earlier, I'm a perfectionist.
But I'll let you see it anyway.
This is my tattoo.
I can guess what some of you are thinking.
So let me reassure you about something.
Some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are.
I got this tattoo because I spent most of my 20s living outside the country and traveling.
And when I came and settled in New York afterward, I was worried that I would forget some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time.
Specifically the two things I learned about myself that I most didn't want to forget was how important it felt to keep exploring and, simultaneously, how important it is to somehow keep an eye on your own true north.
And what I loved about this image of the compass was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image.
And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device.
Well it did.
But it turns out, it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would; it reminds me constantly of something else instead.
It actually reminds me of the most important lesson regret can teach us, which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us.
And ironically, I think it's probably the single most important thing I possibly could have tattooed onto my body -- partly as a writer, but also just as a human being.
Here's the thing, if we have goals and dreams, and we want to do our best, and if we love people and we don't want to hurt them or lose them, we should feel pain when things go wrong.
The point isn't to live without any regrets.
The point is to not hate ourselves for having them.
The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo and that I want to leave you with today is this: We need to learn to love the flawed, imperfect things that we create and to forgive ourselves for creating them.
Regret doesn't remind us that we did badly.
It reminds us that we know we can do better.
Thank you.

<title>Kathryn Schulz: Don't regret regret</title>
<description>We're taught to try to live life without regret. But why? Using her own tattoo as an example, Kathryn Schulz makes a powerful and moving case for embracing our regrets.</description>
<keywords>culture,failure</keywords>

I'm actually going to share something with you I haven't talked about probably in more than 10 years.
So bear with me as I take you through this journey.
When I was 22 years old, I came home from work, put a leash on my dog and went for my usual run.
I had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever.
While I was preparing my dog for the run, a man was finishing drinking at a bar, picked up his car keys, got into a car and headed south, or wherever he was.
I was running across the street, and the only thing that I actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head.
And I remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth.
What had happened is he ran a red light and hit me and my dog.
She ended up underneath the car.
I flew out in front of the car, and then he ran over my legs.
My left leg got caught up in the wheel well -- spun it around.
The bumper of the car hit my throat, slicing it open.
I ended up with blunt chest trauma.
Your aorta comes up behind your heart.
It's your major artery, and it was severed, so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth.
It foamed, and horrible things were happening to me.
I had no idea what was going on, but strangers intervened, kept my heart moving, beating.
I say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it.
Somebody was smart and put a Bic pen in my neck to open up my airway so that I could get some air in there.
And my lung collapsed, so somebody cut me open and put a pin in there as well to stop that catastrophic event from happening.
Somehow I ended up at the hospital.
I was wrapped in ice and then eventually put into a drug-induced coma.
18 months later I woke up.
I was blind, I couldn't speak, and I couldn't walk.
I was 64 lbs.
The hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that.
And in fact, they started to call me a Gomer.
That's another story we won't even get into.
I had so many surgeries to put my neck back together, to repair my heart a few times.
Some things worked, some things didn't.
I had lots of titanium put in me, cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way.
And I ended up with a plastic nose, porcelain teeth and all kinds of other things.
But eventually I started to look human again.
But it's hard sometimes to talk about these things, so bear with me.
I had more than 50 surgeries.
But who's counting?
So eventually, the hospital decided it was time for me to go.
They needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could come back from whatever they were going through.
Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover.
So they basically put a map up on the wall, threw a dart, and it landed at a senior home here in Colorado.
And I know all of you are scratching your head: "A senior citizens' home? What in the world are you going to do there?"
But if you think about all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now, that's what a senior home has.
So there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had.
The one advantage that they had over most of you is wisdom, because they had a long life.
And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life.
But imagine what it was like for them when I showed up at their doorstep?
At that point, I had gained four pounds, so I was 68 lbs.
I was bald.
I was wearing hospital scrubs.
And somebody donated tennis shoes for me.
And I had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand.
And so the senior citizens realized that they needed to have an emergency meeting.
So they pulled back and they were looking at each other, and they were going, "Okay, what skills do we have in this room?
This kid needs a lot of work."
So they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs.
But one of the first things they needed to do was assess what I needed right away.
I needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being, since I'd been eating through a tube in my chest and through my veins.
So I had to go through trying to eat again.
And they went through that process.
And then they had to figure out: "Well she needs furniture.
She is sleeping in the corner of this apartment."
So they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture -- gave me pots and pans, blankets, everything.
And then the next thing that I needed was a makeover.
So out went the green scrubs and in came the polyester and floral prints.
We're not going to talk about the hairstyles that they tried to force on me once my hair grew back.
But I did say no to the blue hair.
So eventually what went on is they decided that, well I need to learn to speak.
So you can't be an independent person if you're not able to speak and can't see.
So they figured not being able to see is one thing, but they need to get me to talk.
So while Sally, the office manager, was teaching me to speak in the day -- it's hard, because when you're a kid, you take things for granted.
You learn things unconsciously.
But for me, I was an adult and it was embarrassing, and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips, and capture the air and get the word out.
So I acted like a two-year-old and refused to work.
But the men had a better idea.
They were going to make it fun for me.
So they were teaching me cuss word Scrabble at night, and then, secretly, how to swear like a sailor.
So I'm going to just leave it to your imagination as to what my first words were when Sally finally got my confidence built.
So I moved on from there.
And a former teacher who happened to have Alzheimer's took on the task of teaching me to write.
The redundancy was actually good for me.
So we'll just keep moving on.
One of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross a street again as a blind person.
So close your eyes.
Now imagine you have to cross a street.
You don't know how far that street is and you don't know if you're going straight and you hear cars whizzing back and forth, and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation.
So there were two obstacles I had to get through.
One was post-traumatic stress disorder.
And every time I approached the corner or the curb I would panic.
And the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street.
So one of the seniors just came up to me, and she pushed me up to the corner and she said, "When you think it's time to go, just stick the cane out there.
If it's hit, don't cross the street."
Made perfect sense.
But by the third cane that went whizzing across the road, they realized that they needed to put the resources together, and they raised funds so that I could go to the Braille Institute and actually gain the skills to be a blind person, and also to go get a guide dog who transformed my life.
And I was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me, and also the guide dog and skill set I had gained.
10 years later I gained my sight back.
Not magically.
I opted in for three surgeries, and one of them was experimental.
It was actually robotic surgery.
They removed a hematoma from behind my eye.
The biggest change for me was that the world moved forward, that there were innovations and all kinds of new things -- cellphones, laptops, all these things that I had never seen before.
And as a blind person, your visual memory fades and is replaced with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell.
So one day I was in my room and I saw this thing sitting in my room and I thought it was a monster.
So I was walking around it.
And I go, "I'm just going to touch it."
And I touched it and I went, "Oh my God, it's a laundry basket."
So everything is different when you're a sighted person because you take that for granted.
But when you're blind, you have the tactile memory for things.
The biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that I'd lost 10 years of my life.
I thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends.
But when I looked down, I realized that time marched on for me too and that I needed to get caught up, so I got going on it.
We didn't have words like crowd-sourcing and radical collaboration when I had my accident.
But the concept held true -- people working with people to rebuild me; people working with people to re-educate me.
I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for extreme radical collaboration.
Thank you so much.

On my desk in my office, I keep a small clay pot that I made in college. It's raku, which is a kind of pottery that began in Japan centuries ago as a way of making bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony.
This one is more than 400 years old.
Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay, and it was the imperfections that people cherished.
Everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire.
I just took this out of the kiln last week, and the kiln itself takes another day or two to cool down, but raku is really fast. You do it outside, and you take the kiln up to temperature. In 15 minutes, it goes to 1,500 degrees, and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside, you can see that faint sheen, you turn the kiln off, and you reach in with these long metal tongs, you grab the pot, and in Japan, this red-hot pot would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea, and you can imagine what that steam would smell like.
But here in the United States, we ramp up the drama a little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust, which catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail, and you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out.
I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke.
I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements.
I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze, but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke, and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen, like this crackle pattern, because it's really stressful on these pots. They go from 1,500 degrees to room temperature in the space of just a minute.
Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity.
I find in so many things that tension between what I can control and what I have to let go happens all the time, whether I'm creating a new radio show or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons.
When I sat down to write a book about creativity, I realized that the steps were reversed.
I had to let go at the very beginning, and I had to immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists and writers and musicians and filmmakers, and as I listened to these stories, I realized that creativity grows out of everyday experiences more often than you might think, including letting go.
It was supposed to break, but that's okay.
That's part of the letting go, is sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't, because creativity also grows from the broken places.
The best way to learn about anything is through stories, and so I want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspects of life that we need to embrace in order for our own creativity to flourish.
The first embrace is something that we think, "Oh, this is very easy," but it's actually getting harder, and that's paying attention to the world around us.
So many artists speak about needing to be open, to embrace experience, and that's hard to do when you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that takes all of your focus.
The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up in a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar, and here's a picture of one of the temples in her town.
Mira Nair: In this little town, there were like 2,000 temples.
We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me, that led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually, was traveling folk theater that would come through the town and I would go off and see these great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of, you know, passion, and hashish as well, and it was amazing.
You know, the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana, the two holy books, the epics that everything comes out of in India, they say. After seeing that Jatra, the folk theater, I knew I wanted to get on, you know, and perform.
Julie Burstein: Isn't that a wonderful story?
You can see the sort of break in the everyday.
There they are in the school fields, but it's good and evil, and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl with thousands of other people watching this performance, but she was ready. She was ready to open up to what it sparked in her, and it led her, as she said, down this path to become an award-winning filmmaker.
So being open for that experience that might change you is the first thing we need to embrace.
Artists also speak about how some of their most powerful work comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult.
The novelist Richard Ford speaks about a childhood challenge that continues to be something he wrestles with today. He's severely dyslexic.
Richard Ford: I was slow to learn to read, went all the way through school not really reading more than the minimum, and still to this day can't read silently much faster than I can read aloud, but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me because when I finally did reconcile myself to how slow I was going to have to do it, then I think I came very slowly into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language and of sentences that are not just the cognitive aspects of language: the syncopations, the sounds of words, what words look like, where paragraphs break, where lines break. I mean, I wasn't so badly dyslexic that I was disabled from reading. I just had to do it really slowly, and as I did, lingering on those sentences as I had to linger, I fell heir to language's other qualities, which I think has helped me write sentences.
JB: It's so powerful. Richard Ford, who's won the Pulitzer Prize, says that dyslexia helped him write sentences.
He had to embrace this challenge, and I use that word intentionally. He didn't have to overcome dyslexia.
He had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the music in language.
Artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do, sometimes pushing into what they can't do, helps them focus on finding their own voice.
The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how, as a young artist, he thought he was a painter, and he lived in Florence after graduate school.
While he was there, he traveled to Madrid, where he went to the Prado to see this picture by the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez.
It's from 1656, and it's called "Las Meninas," and it's the picture of a little princess and her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look over that little blonde princess's shoulder, you'll see a mirror, and reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queen of Spain, who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture.
As he often did, Velázquez put himself in this painting too.
He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand and his palette in the other.
Richard Serra: I was standing there looking at it, and I realized that Velázquez was looking at me, and I thought, "Oh. I'm the subject of the painting."
And I thought, "I'm not going to be able to do that painting."
I was to the point where I was using a stopwatch and painting squares out of randomness, and I wasn't getting anywhere. So I went back and dumped all my paintings in the Arno, and I thought, I'm going to just start playing around.
JB: Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly, you might have missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy who'd been dead for 300 years, and realized, "I can't do that," and so Richard Serra went back to his studio in Florence, picked up all of his work up to that point, and threw it in a river.
Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment, but he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City, and he put together a list of verbs — to roll, to crease, to fold — more than a hundred of them, and as he said, he just started playing around. He did these things to all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead and roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing to rubber, and when he got to the direction "to lift," he created this, which is in the Museum of Modern Art.
Richard Serra had to let go of painting in order to embark on this playful exploration that led him to the work that he's known for today: huge curves of steel that require our time and motion to experience. In sculpture, Richard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting.
He makes us the subject of his art.
So experience and challenge and limitations are all things we need to embrace for creativity to flourish.
There's a fourth embrace, and it's the hardest.
It's the embrace of loss, the oldest and most constant of human experiences.
In order to create, we have to stand in that space between what we see in the world and what we hope for, looking squarely at rejection, at heartbreak, at war, at death.
That's a tough space to stand in.
The educator Parker Palmer calls it "the tragic gap," tragic not because it's sad but because it's inevitable, and my friend Dick Nodel likes to say, "You can hold that tension like a violin string and make something beautiful."
That tension resonates in the work of the photographer Joel Meyerowitz, who at the beginning of his career was known for his street photography, for capturing a moment on the street, and also for his beautiful photographs of landscapes -- of Tuscany, of Cape Cod, of light.
Joel is a New Yorker, and his studio for many years was in Chelsea, with a straight view downtown to the World Trade Center, and he photographed those buildings in every sort of light.
You know where this story goes.
On 9/11, Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town, but he raced back to the city, and raced down to the site of the destruction.
Joel Meyerowitz: And like all the other passersby, I stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers and Greenwich, and all I could see was the smoke and a little bit of rubble, and I raised my camera to take a peek, just to see if there was something to see, and some cop, a lady cop, hit me on my shoulder, and said, "Hey, no pictures!"
And it was such a blow that it woke me up, in the way that it was meant to be, I guess.
And when I asked her why no pictures, she said, "It's a crime scene. No photographs allowed."
And I asked her, "What would happen if I was a member of the press?" And she told me, "Oh, look back there," and back a block was the press corps tied up in a little penned-in area, and I said, "Well, when do they go in?"
and she said, "Probably never."
And as I walked away from that, I had this crystallization, probably from the blow, because it was an insult in a way.
I thought, "Oh, if there's no pictures, then there'll be no record. We need a record."
And I thought, "I'm gonna make that record.
I'll find a way to get in, because I don't want to see this history disappear."
JB: He did. He pulled in every favor he could, and got a pass into the World Trade Center site, where he photographed for nine months almost every day.
Looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when I went home to my family at night.
My office was just a few blocks away.
But some of these photographs are beautiful, and we wondered, was it difficult for Joel Meyerowitz to make such beauty out of such devastation?
JM: Well, you know, ugly, I mean, powerful and tragic and horrific and everything, but it was also as, in nature, an enormous event that was transformed after the fact into this residue, and like many other ruins — you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace — and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather.
I mean, there were afternoons I was down there, and the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air and you're standing in the rubble, and I found myself recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature and the fact that nature, as time, is erasing this wound.
Time is unstoppable, and it transforms the event.
It gets further and further away from the day, and light and seasons temper it in some way, and it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist.
The reality is, there's the Woolworth Building in a veil of smoke from the site, but it's now like a scrim across a theater, and it's turning pink, you know, and down below there are hoses spraying, and the lights have come on for the evening, and the water is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on, and I'm thinking, "My God, who could dream this up?"
But the fact is, I'm there, it looks like that, you have to take a picture.
JB: You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency, of the need to get to work, is so powerful in Joel's story.
When I saw Joel Meyerowitz recently, I told him how much I admired his passionate obstinacy, his determination to push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work, and he laughed, and he said, "I'm stubborn, but I think what's more important is my passionate optimism."
The first time I told these stories, a man in the audience raised his hand and said, "All these artists talk about their work, not their art, which has got me thinking about my work and where the creativity is there, and I'm not an artist." He's right. We all wrestle with experience and challenge, limits and loss.
Creativity is essential to all of us, whether we're scientists or teachers, parents or entrepreneurs.
I want to leave you with another image of a Japanese tea bowl. This one is at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C.
It's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it.
But as you can also see, this one did break at some point in its hundred years.
But the person who put it back together, instead of hiding the cracks, decided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it.
This bowl is more beautiful now, having been broken, than it was when it was first made, and we can look at those cracks, because they tell the story that we all live, of the cycle of creation and destruction, of control and letting go, of picking up the pieces and making something new.
Thank you.

I want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine, and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved.
Our society loves to romanticize the idea of the single, solo inventor who, working late in the lab one night, makes an earthshaking discovery, and voila, overnight everything's changed.
That's a very appealing picture, however, it's just not true.
In fact, medicine today is a team sport.
And in many ways, it always has been.
I'd like to share with you a story about how I've experienced this very dramatically in my own work.
I'm a surgeon, and we surgeons have always had this special relationship with light.
When I make an incision inside a patient's body, it's dark.
We need to shine light to see what we're doing.
And this is why, traditionally, surgeries have always started so early in the morning -- to take advantage of daylight hours.
And if you look at historical pictures of the early operating rooms, they have been on top of buildings.
For example, this is the oldest operating room in the Western world, in London, where the operating room is actually on top of a church with a skylight coming in.
And then this is a picture of one of the most famous hospitals in America.
This is Mass General in Boston.
And do you know where the operating room is?
Here it is on the top of the building with plenty of windows to let light in.
So nowadays in the operating room, we no longer need to use sunlight.
And because we no longer need to use sunlight, we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room.
We have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights -- lights that can allow us to see what we currently don't see.
And this is what I think is the magic of fluorescence.
So let me back up a little bit.
When we are in medical school, we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything's color-coded.
Nerves are yellow, arteries are red, veins are blue.
That's so easy anybody could become a surgeon, right?
However, when we have a real patient on the table, this is the same neck dissection -- not so easy to tell the difference between different structures.
We heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society, what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute.
Well if cancer can be caught early, enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out, excised with surgery, I don't care if it has this gene or that gene, or if it has this protein or that protein, it's in the jar.
It's done, it's out, you're cured of cancer.
This is how we excise cancers.
We do our best, based upon our training and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience, we say, you know what, the cancer's gone.
We've made a good job. We've taken it out.
That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient's on the table.
But then we actually don't know that it's all out.
We actually have to take samples from the surgical bed, what's left behind in the patient, and then send those bits to the pathology lab.
In the meanwhile, the patient's on the operating room table.
The nurses, anesthesiologist, the surgeon, all the assistants are waiting around.
And we wait.
The pathologist takes that sample, freezes it, cuts it, looks in the microscope one by one and then calls back into the room.
And that may be 20 minutes later per piece.
So if you've sent three specimens, it's an hour later.
And very often they say, "You know what, points A and B are okay, but point C, you still have some residual cancer there.
Please go cut that piece out."
So we go back and we do that again, and again.
And this whole process: "Okay you're done.
We think the entire tumor is out."
But very often several days later, the patient's gone home, we get a phone call: "I'm sorry, once we looked at the final pathology, once we looked at the final specimen, we actually found that there's a couple other spots where the margins are positive.
There's still cancer in your patient."
So now you're faced with telling your patient, first of all, that they may need another surgery, or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy.
So wouldn't it be better if we could really tell, if the surgeon could really tell, whether or not there's still cancer on the surgical field?
I mean, in many ways, the way that we're doing it, we're still operating in the dark.
So in 2004, during my surgical residency, I had the great fortune to meet Dr. Roger Chen, who went on to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2008.
Roger and his team were working on a way to detect cancer, and they had a very clever molecule that they had come up with.
The molecule they had developed had three parts.
The main part of it is the blue part, polycation, and it's basically very sticky to every tissue in your body.
So imagine that you make a solution full of this sticky material and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer, everything's going to get lit up.
Nothing will be specific.
There's no specificity there.
So they added two additional components.
The first one is a polyanionic segment, which basically acts as a non-stick backing like the back of a sticker.
So when those two are together, the molecule is neutral and nothing gets stuck down.
And the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors -- for example, the kind of protease enzymes that tumors make.
So here in this situation, if you make a solution full of this three-part molecule along with the dye, which is shown in green, and you inject it into the vein of someone who has cancer, normal tissue can't cut it.
The molecule passes through and gets excreted.
However, in the presence of the tumor, now there are molecular scissors that can break this molecule apart right there at the cleavable site.
And now, boom, the tumor labels itself and it gets fluorescent.
So here's an example of a nerve that has tumor surrounding it.
Can you tell where the tumor is?
I couldn't when I was working on this.
But here it is. It's fluorescent.
Now it's green.
See, so every single one in the audience now can tell where the cancer is.
We can tell in the operating room, in the field, at a molecular level, where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out.
And the cool thing about fluorescence is that it's not only bright, it actually can shine through tissue.
The light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue.
So even if the tumor is not right on the surface, you'll still be able to see it.
In this movie, you can see that the tumor is green.
There's actually normal muscle on top of it. See that?
And I'm peeling that muscle away.
But even before I peel that muscle away, you saw that there was a tumor underneath.
So that's the beauty of having a tumor that's labeled with fluorescent molecules.
That you can, not only see the margins right there on a molecular level, but you can see it even if it's not right on the top -- even if it's beyond your field of view.
And this works for metastatic lymph nodes also.
Sentinel lymph node dissection has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer, melanoma.
Women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes.
But when sentinel lymph node came into our treatment protocol, the surgeon basically looks for the single node that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer.
And then if that node has cancer, the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection.
So what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer, the woman would be saved from having unnecessary surgery.
But sentinel lymph node, the way that we do it today, is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go.
So if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station, you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road.
It doesn't tell you whether or not the gas station has gas.
You have to cut it out, bring it back home, cut it up, look inside and say, "Oh yes, it does have gas."
So that takes more time.
Patients are still on the operating room table.
Anesthesiologists, surgeons are waiting around.
That takes time.
So with our technology, we can tell right away.
You see a lot of little, roundish bumps there.
Some of these are swollen lymph nodes that look a little larger than others.
Who amongst us hasn't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold?
That doesn't mean that there's cancer inside.
Well with our technology, the surgeon is able to tell immediately which nodes have cancer.
I won't go into this very much, but our technology, besides being able to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence, we can also use the same smart three-part molecule to tag gadolinium onto the system so you can do this noninvasively.
The patient has cancer, you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer even before you go in.
Well you can see this on an MRI.
So in surgery, it's important to know what to cut out.
But equally important is to preserve things that are important for function.
So it's very important to avoid inadvertent injury.
And what I'm talking about are nerves.
Nerves, if they are injured, can cause paralysis, can cause pain.
In the setting of prostate cancer, up to 60 percent of men after prostate cancer surgery may have urinary incontinence and erectile disfunction.
That's a lot of people to have a lot of problems -- and this is even in so-called nerve-sparing surgery, which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem, and they are trying to avoid the nerves.
But you know what, these little nerves are so small, in the context of prostate cancer, that they are actually never seen.
They are traced just by their known anatomical path along vasculature.
And they're known because somebody has decided to study them, which means that we're still learning about where they are.
Crazy to think that we're having surgery, we're trying to excise cancer, we don't know where the cancer is.
We're trying to preserve nerves; we can't see where they are.
So I said, wouldn't it be great if we could find a way to see nerves with fluorescence?
And at first this didn't get a lot of support.
People said, "We've been doing it this way for all these years.
What's the problem?
We haven't had that many complications."
But I went ahead anyway.
And Roger helped me.
And he brought his whole team with him.
So there's that teamwork thing again.
And we eventually discovered molecules that were specifically labeling nerves.
And when we made a solution of this, tagged with the fluorescence and injected in the body of a mouse, their nerves literally glowed.
You can see where they are.
Here you're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse, and you can see that that big, fat portion you can see very easily.
But in fact, at the tip of that where I'm dissecting now, there's actually very fine arborizations that can't really be seen.
You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out.
We have been able to see nerves for facial expression, for facial movement, for breathing -- every single nerve -- nerves for urinary function around the prostate.
We've been able to see every single nerve.
When we put these two probes together ...
So here's a tumor.
Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is?
Now you do.
What about the nerve that's going into this tumor?
That white portion there is easy to see.
But what about the part that goes into the tumor?
Do you know where it's going?
Now you do.
Basically, we've come up with a way to stain tissue and color-code the surgical field.
This was a bit of a breakthrough.
I think that it'll change the way that we do surgery.
We published our results in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and in Nature Biotechnology.
We received commentary in Discover magazine, in The Economist.
And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues.
They said, "Wow!
I have patients who would benefit from this.
I think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications."
What needs to happen now is further development of our technology along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence in the operating room.
The eventual goal is that we'll get this into patients.
However, we've discovered that there's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molecule for one-time use.
Understandably, the majority of the medical industry is focused on multiple-use drugs, such as long-term daily medications.
We are focused on making this technology better.
We're focused on adding drugs, adding growth factors, killing nerves that are causing problems and not the surrounding tissue.
We know that this can be done and we're committed to doing it.
I'd like to leave you with this final thought.
Successful innovation is not a single breakthrough.
It is not a sprint.
It is not an event for the solo runner.
Successful innovation is a team sport, it's a relay race.
It requires one team for the breakthrough and another team to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted.
And this takes the long-term steady courage of the day-in day-out struggle to educate, to persuade and to win acceptance.
And that is the light that I want to shine on health and medicine today.
Thank you very much.

Humans in the developed world spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors, where they breathe in and come into contact with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye: microorganisms.
Buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us, and some that are bad for us.
What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors?
Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems.
And they are brought inside by humans and other creatures.
The fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans, and with the human-built environment.
And today, architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us.
We spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments, like this building here -- environments that have mechanical ventilation systems that include filtering, heating and air conditioning.
Given the amount of time that we spend indoors, it's important to understand how this affects our health.
At the Biology and the Built Environment Center, we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the DNA out of microbes in the air.
And we looked at three different types of rooms.
We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated, which are the data points in the blue.
We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated, where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable, but they made them operable for our study.
And we also sampled the outdoor air.
If you look at the x-axis of this graph, you'll see that what we commonly want to do -- which is keeping the outdoors out -- we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation.
So if you look at the green data points, which is air that's outside, you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity, or variety of microbial types.
But if you look at the blue data points, which is mechanically ventilated air, it's not as diverse.
But being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health.
If you look at the y-axis of this graph, you'll see that, in the mechanically ventilated air, you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen, or germ, than if you're outdoors.
So to understand why this was the case, we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram, which is a statistical map that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples.
The data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart.
And the first things that you can see from this graph is, if you look at the blue data points, which are the mechanically ventilated air, they're not simply a subset of the green data points, which are the outdoor air.
What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans.
It has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth, our spit.
And this is because we're all constantly shedding microbes.
So all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another.
And when you're outdoors, that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt.
Why does this matter?
It matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the United States.
Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings.
And the model that we're working with in hospitals, and also with many, many different buildings, is to keep the outdoors out.
And this model may not necessarily be the best for our health.
And given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections, or hospital-acquired infections, this is a clue that it's a good time to reconsider our current practices.
So just as we manage national parks, where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others, we're working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors.
I've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut.
And for this reason, many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora.
And what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside.
Thank you.

<title>Jessica Green: Are we filtering the wrong microbes?</title>
<description>Should we keep the outdoors out of hospitals? Ecologist and Fellow Jessica Green has found that mechanical ventilation does get rid of many types of microbes, but the wrong kinds: the ones left in the hospital are much more likely to be pathogens.</description>

Evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form.
From mother to daughter, preacher to congregant, teacher to pupil, storyteller to audience.
Whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the Internet, human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable.
We are inveterate storytellers.
But where, in our increasingly secular and fragmented world, do we offer communality of experience, unmediated by our own furious consumerism?
And what narrative, what history, what identity, what moral code are we imparting to our young?
Cinema is arguably the 20th century's most influential art form.
Its artists told stories across national boundaries, in as many languages, genres and philosophies as one can imagine.
Indeed, it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle.
During the last decade we've seen a vast integration of global media, now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster.
We are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation, not story, is king.
What was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now rarified.
As a filmmaker, it worried me.
As a human being, it puts the fear of God in me.
What future could the young build with so little grasp of where they've come from and so few narratives of what's possible?
The irony is palpable; technical access has never been greater, cultural access never weaker.
And so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB, an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions.
If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film, maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young.
Given the access to technology, even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a DVD onto a white board.
In the first nine months we ran 25 clubs across the U.K., with kids in age groups between five and 18 watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes.
The films were curated and contextualized.
But the choice was theirs, and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide.
The outcome, immediate.
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind.
In groups as large as 150 and as small as three, these young people discovered new places, new thoughts, new perspectives.
By the time the pilot had finished, we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join.
The film that changed my life is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, "Miracle in Milan."
It's a remarkable comment on slums, poverty and aspiration.
I had seen the film on the occasion of my father's 50th birthday.
Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema, find and pay for the print and the projectionist.
But for my father, the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half-century with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends, "In order," he said, "to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation."
In the last shot of "Miracle in Milan," slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms.
Sixty years after the film was made and 30 years after I first saw it, I see young faces tilt up in awe, their incredulity matching mine.
And the speed with which they associate it with "Slumdog Millionaire" or the favelas in Rio speaks to the enduring nature.
In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government, we screened "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."
Made in 1939, the film is older than most of our members' grandparents.
Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.
It shows how to do right, how to be heroically awkward.
It is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor.
Shortly after "Mr. Smith" became a FILMCLUB classic, there was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords.
And it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle.
After all, Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels.
In choosing "Hotel Rwanda," they explored genocide of the most brutal kind.
It provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a Western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind.
And when "Schindler's List" demanded that they never forget, one child, full of the pain of consciousness, remarked, "We already forgot, otherwise how did 'Hotel Rwanda' happen?"
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer.
"Pickpocket" started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement.
"To Sir, with Love" ignited its teen audience.
They celebrated a change in attitude towards non-white Britons, but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity, unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage.
By now, these thoughtful, opinionated, curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms -- black and white, subtitled, documentary, non-narrative, fantasy -- and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose.
Six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week.
From 25 clubs, we became hundreds, then thousands, until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in 7,000 clubs right across the country.
And although the numbers were, and continue to be, extraordinary, what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life.
Some of our kids started talking with their parents, others with their teachers, or with their friends.
And those without friends started making them.
The films provided communality across all manner of divide.
And the stories they held provided a shared experience.
"Persepolis" brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother, and "Jaws" became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he'd experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother, the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey.
Who was right, who wrong?
What would they do under the same conditions?
Was the tale told well?
Was there a hidden message?
How has the world changed? How could it be different?
A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn't think were interested.
And they themselves had not known they cared.
And as they wrote and debated, rather than seeing the films as artifacts, they began to see themselves.
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller.
In a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers.
Quite recently she told me that in 1948, two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents.
When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions, it was these teenagers that fed the crew.
I was past 40 when my father died.
He never mentioned that journey.
My mother's mother left Europe in a hurry without her husband, but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt.
After two years in hiding, my grandfather appeared in London.
He was never right again.
And his story was hushed as he assimilated.
My story started in England with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents.
I had "Anne Frank," "The Great Escape," "Shoah," "Triumph of the Will."
It was Leni Riefenstahl in her elegant Nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure.
These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud, and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt's wrist.
Purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding, that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history, or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth.
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning.
As one 12-year-old said after watching "Wizard of Oz," "Every person should watch this, because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart."
We honor reading, why not honor watching with the same passion?
Consider "Citizen Kane" as valuable as Jane Austen.
Agree that "Boyz n the Hood," like Tennyson, offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together.
Each a piece of memorable art, each a brick in the wall of who we are.
And it's okay if we remember Tom Hanks better than astronaut Jim Lovell or have Ben Kingsley's face superimposed onto that of Gandhi's.
And though not real, Eve Harrington, Howard Beale, Mildred Pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human, and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England.
We guessed that film, whose stories are a meeting place of drama, music, literature and human experience, would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB.
What we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior, confidence and academic achievement.
Once-reluctant students now race to school, talk to their teachers, fight, not on the playground, but to choose next week's film -- young people who have found self-definition, ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed.
Our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young.
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed.
They are, like other young people, negotiating a world with infinite choice, but little culture of how to find meaningful experience.
We appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes, yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered.
If we want different values we have to tell a different story, a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person's identity, that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity, and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group.
Because when these people get home after a screening of "Rear Window" and raise their gaze to the building next door, they have the tools to wonder who, apart from them, is out there and what is their story.
Thank you.

So here it is. You can check: I am short, I'm French, I have a pretty strong French accent, so that's going to be clear in a moment.
Maybe a sobering thought and something you all know about.
And I suspect many of you gave something to the people of Haiti this year.
And there is something else I believe in the back of your mind you also know.
That is, every day, 25,000 children die of entirely preventable causes.
That's a Haiti earthquake every eight days.
And I suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well, but somehow it doesn't happen with the same intensity.
So why is that?
Well, here is a thought experiment for you.
Imagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised -- maybe you're a politician in a developing country and you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor: How do you go about it?
Do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money?
That we know how to eradicate poverty, we just need to do more?
Or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help, on the contrary it might hurt, it might exacerbate corruption, dependence, etc.?
Or maybe you turn to the past.
After all, we have spent billions of dollars on aid.
Maybe you look at the past and see.
Has it done any good?
And, sadly, we don't know.
And worst of all, we will never know.
And the reason is that -- take Africa for example.
Africans have already got a lot of aid.
These are the blue bars.
And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress.
Okay, fine. How do you know what would have happened without the aid?
Maybe it would have been much worse, or maybe it would have been better.
We have no idea. We don't know what the counterfactual is.
There's only one Africa.
So what do you do?
To give the aid, and hope and pray that something comes out of it?
Or do you focus on your everyday life and let the earthquake every eight days continue to happen?
The thing is, if we don't know whether we are doing any good, we are not any better than the Medieval doctors and their leeches.
Sometimes the patient gets better, sometimes the patient dies.
Is it the leeches? Is it something else?
We don't know.
So here are some other questions.
They're smaller questions, but they are not that small.
Immunization, that's the cheapest way to save a child's life.
And the world has spent a lot of money on it: The GAVI and the Gates Foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it, and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort.
And yet, every year at least 25 million children do not get the immunization they should get.
So this is what you call a "last mile problem."
The technology is there, the infrastructure is there, and yet it doesn't happen.
So you have your million.
How do you use your million to solve this last mile problem?
And here's another question: Malaria. Malaria kills almost 900,000 people every year, most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa, most of them under five.
In fact, that is the leading cause of under-five mortality.
We already know how to kill malaria, but some people come to you and say, "You have your millions. How about bed nets?"
Bed nets are very cheap.
For 10 dollars, you can manufacture and ship an insecticide treated bed net and you can teach someone to use them.
And, not only do they protect the people who sleep under them, but they have these great contagion benefits.
If half of a community sleeps under a net, the other half also benefits because the contagion of the disease spread.
And yet, only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net.
Societies should be willing to go out and subsidize the net, give them for free, or, for that matter, pay people to use them because of those contagion benefits.
"Not so fast," say other people.
"If you give the nets for free, people are not going to value them.
They're not going to use them, or at least they're not going to use them as bed nets, maybe as fishing nets."
So, what do you do?
Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage, or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them?
How do you know?
And a third question: Education.
Maybe that's the solution, maybe we should send kids to school.
But how do you do that?
Do you hire teachers? Do you build more schools?
Do you provide school lunch?
How do you know?
So here is the thing.
I cannot answer the big question, whether aid did any good or not.
But these three questions, I can answer them.
It's not the Middle Ages anymore, it's the 21st century.
And in the 20th century, randomized, controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don't work.
And you can do the same randomized, controlled trial for social policy.
You can put social innovation to the same rigorous, scientific tests that we use for drugs.
And in this way, you can take the guesswork out of policy-making by knowing what works, what doesn't work and why.
And I'll give you some examples with those three questions.
So I start with immunization.
Here's Udaipur District, Rajasthan. Beautiful.
Well, when I started working there, about one percent of children were fully immunized.
That's bad, but there are places like that.
Now, it's not because the vaccines are not there -- they are there and they are free -- and it's not because parents do not care about their kids.
The same child that is not immunized against measles, if they do get measles, parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them.
So you get these empty village subcenters and crowded hospitals.
So what is the problem?
Well, part of the problem, surely, is people do not fully understand.
After all, in this country as well, all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization.
So if that's the case, that's difficult, because persuasion is really difficult.
But maybe there is another problem as well.
It's going from intention to action.
Imagine you are a mother in Udaipur District, Rajasthan.
You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized.
And maybe when you get there, what you find is this: The subcenter is closed. Ao you have to come back, and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do, you will always tend to postpone and postpone, and eventually it gets too late.
Well, if that's the problem, then that's much easier.
Because A, we can make it easy, and B, we can maybe give people a reason to act today, rather than wait till tomorrow.
So these are simple ideas, but we didn't know.
So let's try them.
So what we did is we did a randomized, controlled trial in 134 villages in Udaipur Districts.
So the blue dots are selected randomly.
We made it easy -- I'll tell you how in a moment.
In the red dots, we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now.
The white dots are comparisons, nothing changed.
So we make it easy by organizing this monthly camp where people can get their kids immunized.
And then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization.
Now, a kilo of lentils is tiny.
It's never going to convince anybody to do something that they don't want to do.
On the other hand, if your problem is you tend to postpone, then it might give you a reason to act today rather than later.
So what do we find?
Well, beforehand, everything is the same.
That's the beauty of randomization.
Afterwards, the camp -- just having the camp -- increases immunization from six percent to 17 percent.
That's full immunization.
That's not bad, that's a good improvement.
Add the lentils and you reach to 38 percent.
So here you've got your answer.
Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils, you multiply immunization rate by six.
Now, you might say, "Well, but it's not sustainable.
We cannot keep giving lentils to people."
Well, it turns out it's wrong economics, because it is cheaper to give lentils than not to give them.
Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway, the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't.
How about bed nets?
Should you give them for free, or should you ask people to pay for them?
So the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions.
One is: If people must pay for a bed net, are they going to purchase them?
The second one is: If I give bed nets for free, are people going to use them?
And the third one is: Do free bed nets discourage future purchase?
The third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts, it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets.
Now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric.
It's more ideological than practical, but it turns out it's an easy question.
We can know the answer to this question.
We can just run an experiment.
And many experiments have been run, and they all have the same results, so I'm just going to talk to you about one.
And this one that was in Kenya, they went around and distributed to people vouchers, discount vouchers.
So people with their voucher could get the bed net in the local pharmacy.
And some people get 100 percent discount, and some people get 20 percent discounts, and some people get 50 percent discount, etc.
And now we can see what happens.
So, how about the purchasing?
Well, what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets, the coverage rate really falls down a lot.
So even with partial subsidy, three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net, and now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets, you lose the health immunity, that's not great.
Second thing is, how about the use?
Well, the good news is, people, if they have the bed nets, will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it.
If they get it for free, they use it.
If they have to pay for it, they use it.
How about the long term?
In the long term, people who got the free bed nets, one year later, were offered the option to purchase a bed net at two dollars.
And people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn't get a free one.
So people do not get used to handouts; they get used to nets.
Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit.
So, that's for bed nets. So you will think, "That's great.
You know how to immunize kids, you know how to give bed nets."
But what politicians need is a range of options.
They need to know: Out of all the things I could do, what is the best way to achieve my goals?
So suppose your goal is to get kids into school.
There are so many things you could do. You could pay for uniforms, you could eliminate fees, you could build latrines, you could give girls sanitary pads, etc., etc.
So what's the best?
Well, at some level, we think all of these things should work.
So, is that sufficient? If we think they should work intuitively, should we go for them?
Well, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it.
Consider for example transporting goods.
Before the canals were invented in Britain before the Industrial Revolution, goods used to go on horse carts.
And then canals were built, and with the same horseman and the same horse, you could carry ten times as much cargo.
So should they have continued to carry the goods on the horse carts, on the ground, that they would eventually get there?
Well, if that had been the case, there would have been no Industrial Revolution.
So why shouldn't we do the same with social policy?
In technology, we spend so much time experimenting, fine-tuning, getting the absolute cheapest way to do something, so why aren't we doing that with social policy?
Well, with experiments, what you can do is answer a simple question.
Suppose you have 100 dollars to spend on various interventions.
How many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars?
Now I'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions.
So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects, hire teachers, school meals, school uniforms, scholarships.
And that's not bad. For your hundred dollars, you get between one and three extra years of education.
Things that don't work so well is bribing parents, just because so many kids are already going to school that you end up spending a lot of money.
And here are the most surprising results.
Tell people the benefits of education, that's very cheap to do.
So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that, you get 40 extra years of education.
And, in places where there are worms, intestinal worms, cure the kids of their worms.
And for every hundred dollars, you get almost 30 extra years of education.
So this is not your intuition, this is not what people would have gone for, and yet, these are the programs that work.
We need that kind of information, we need more of it, and then we need to guide policy.
So now, I started from the big problem, and I couldn't answer it.
And I cut it into smaller questions, and I have the answer to these smaller questions.
And they are good, scientific, robust answers.
So let's go back to Haiti for a moment.
In Haiti, about 200,000 people died -- actually, a bit more by the latest estimate.
And the response of the world was great: Two billion dollars got pledged just last month, so that's about 10,000 dollars per death.
That doesn't sound like that much when you think about it.
But if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars for every child under five who dies, that would be 90 billion per year just for that problem.
And yet it doesn't happen.
So, why is that?
Well, I think what part of the problem is that, in Haiti, although the problem is huge, somehow we understand it, it's localized.
You give your money to Doctors Without Borders, you give your money to Partners In Health, and they'll send in the doctors, and they'll send in the lumber, and they'll helicopter things out and in.
And the problem of poverty is not like that.
So, first, it's mostly invisible; second, it's huge; and third, we don't know whether we are doing the right thing.
There's no silver bullet.
You cannot helicopter people out of poverty.
And that's very frustrating.
But look what we just did today.
I gave you three simple answers to three questions: Give lentils to immunize people, provide free bed nets, deworm children.
With immunization or bed nets, you can save a life for 300 dollars per life saved.
With deworming, you can get an extra year of education for three dollars.
So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet, but we can get started.
And maybe we can get started small with things that we know are effective.
Here's an example of how this can be powerful.
Deworming.
Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines.
They are not beautiful and don't kill anybody.
And yet, when the young global leader in Davos showed the numbers I gave you, they started Deworm the World.
And thanks to Deworm the World, and the effort of many country governments and foundations, 20 million school-aged children got dewormed in 2009.
So this evidence is powerful.
It can prompt action.
So we should get started now.
It's not going to be easy.
It's a very slow process.
You have to keep experimenting, and sometimes ideology has to be trumped by practicality.
And sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere.
So it's a slow process, but there is no other way.
These economics I'm proposing, it's like 20th century medicine.
It's a slow, deliberative process of discovery.
There is no miracle cure, but modern medicine is saving millions of lives every year, and we can do the same thing.
And now, maybe, we can go back to the bigger question that I started with at the beginning.
I cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference, but can we come back here in 30 years and say, "What we have done, it really prompted a change for the better."
I believe we can and I hope we will.
Thank you.

One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness, so if it was one, two, three, four, it's you, sir.
You. Yeah.
With the weird teeth. And you next to him.
You know who you are.
Actually, that whole row isn't right.
That's not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don't even look at me.
I am one of the one in four. Thank you.
I think I inherit it from my mother, who, used to crawl around the house on all fours.
She had two sponges in her hand, and then she had two tied to her knees. My mother was completely absorbent.
And she would crawl around behind me going, "Who brings footprints into a building?!"
So that was kind of a clue that things weren't right.
So before I start, I would like to thank the makers of Lamotrigine, Sertraline, and Reboxetine, because without those few simple chemicals, I would not be vertical today.
So how did it start?
My mental illness -- well, I'm not even going to talk about my mental illness.
What am I going to talk about? Okay.
I always dreamt that, when I had my final breakdown, it would be because I had a deep Kafkaesque existentialist revelation, or that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it.
But that's not what happened. I had my breakdown during my daughter's sports day.
There were all the parents sitting in a parking lot eating food out of the back of their car -- only the English -- eating their sausages. They loved their sausages.
Lord and Lady Rigor Mortis were nibbling on the tarmac, and then the gun went off and all the girlies started running, and all the mummies went, "Run! Run Chlamydia! Run!"
"Run like the wind, Veruca! Run!"
And all the girlies, girlies running, running, running, everybody except for my daughter, who was just standing at the starting line, just waving, because she didn't know she was supposed to run.
So I took to my bed for about a month, and when I woke up I found I was institutionalized, and when I saw the other inmates, I realized that I had found my people, my tribe.
Because they became my only friends, they became my friends, because very few people that I knew -- Well, I wasn't sent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean, if I had had a broken leg or I was with child I would have been inundated, but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up.
Perk up.
Because I didn't think of that.
Because, you know, the one thing, one thing that you get with this disease, this one comes with a package, is you get a real sense of shame, because your friends go, "Oh come on, show me the lump, show me the x-rays," and of course you've got nothing to show, so you're, like, really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking, "I'm not being carpet-bombed. I don't live in a township."
So you start to hear these abusive voices, but you don't hear one abusive voice, you hear about a thousand -- 100,000 abusive voices, like if the Devil had Tourette's, that's what it would sound like.
But we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil, there are no voices in your head.
You know that when you have those abusive voices, all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic "I want to kill myself" kind of chemical, and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape, you might have yourself depression.
Oh, and that's not even the tip of the iceberg.
If you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally, its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow, so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic.
If a soldier sees his friend blown up, his brain goes into such high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words, so he just feels the horror over and over again.
So here's my question. My question is, how come when people have mental damage, it's always an active imagination?
How come every other organ in your body can get sick and you get sympathy, except the brain?
I'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain, because I know you like that here at TED, so if you just give me a minute here, okay.
Okay, let me just say, there's some good news.
There is some good news. First of all, let me say, we've come a long, long way.
We started off as a teeny, teeny little one-celled amoeba, tiny, just sticking onto a rock, and now, voila, the brain.
Here we go.
This little baby has a lot of horsepower.
It comes completely conscious. It's got state-of-the-art lobes.
We've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world.
We got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world.
Here we've got a little bit of long-term memory, so, you know that night you want to forget, when you got really drunk? Bye-bye! Gone.
So actually, it's filled with 100 billion neurons just zizzing away, electrically transmitting information, zizzing, zizzing. I'm going to give you a little side view here.
I don't know if you can get that here.
So, zizzing away, and so — — And for every one — I know, I drew this myself. Thank you.
For every one single neuron, you can actually have from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it, and every time you learn something, or you have an experience, that bush grows, you know, that bush of information.
Can you imagine, every human being is carrying that equipment, even Paris Hilton?
Go figure.
But I got a little bad news for you folks. I got some bad news.
This isn't for the one in four. This is for the four in four.
We are not equipped for the 21st century.
Evolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth, and for people who say, oh, they're having a nice day, they're perfectly fine, they're more insane than the rest of us.
Because I'll show you where there might be a few glitches in evolution. Okay, let me just explain this to you.
When we were ancient man — — millions of years ago, and we suddenly felt threatened by a predator, okay? — — we would — Thank you. I drew these myself.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol, and then we'd kill or be killed, we'd eat or we'd be eaten, and then suddenly we'd de-fuel, and we'd go back to normal. Okay.
So the problem is, nowadays, with modern man— — when we feel in danger, we still fill up with our own chemical but because we can't kill traffic wardens — — or eat estate agents, the fuel just stays in our body over and over, so we're in a constant state of alarm, a constant state. And here's another thing that happened.
About 150,000 years ago, when language came online, we started to put words to this constant emergency, so it wasn't just, "Oh my God, there's a saber-toothed tiger," which could be, it was suddenly, "Oh my God, I didn't send the email. Oh my God, my thighs are too fat.
Oh my God, everybody can see I'm stupid. I didn't get invited to the Christmas party!"
So you've got this nagging loop tape that goes over and over again that drives you insane, so, you see what the problem is? What once made you safe now drives you insane.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but somebody has to be.
Your pets are happier than you are.
So kitty cat, meow, happy happy happy, human beings, screwed.
Completely and utterly -- so, screwed.
But my point is, if we don't talk about this stuff, and we don't learn how to deal with our lives, it's not going to be one in four. It's going to be four in four who are really, really going to get ill in the upstairs department.
And while we're at it, can we please stop the stigma?
Thank you.
Thank you.

This is Shivdutt Yadav, and he's from Uttar Pradesh, India.
Now Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office in Uttar Pradesh, and he discovered that official records were listing him as dead.
His land was no longer registered in his name.
His brothers, Chandrabhan and Phoolchand, were also listed as dead.
Family members had bribed officials to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land by having the brothers declared dead, allowing them to inherit their father's share of the ancestral farmland.
Because of this, all three brothers and their families had to vacate their home.
According to the Yadav family, the local court has been scheduling a case review since 2001, but a judge has never appeared.
There are several instances in Uttar Pradesh of people dying before their case is given a proper review.
Shivdutt's father's death and a want for his property led to this corruption.
He was laid to rest in the Ganges River, where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water.
Photographing these brothers was a disorienting exchange because on paper they don't exist, and a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life.
Yet, these men remain dead.
This quandary led to the title of the project, which considers in many ways that we are all the living dead and that we in some ways represent ghosts of the past and the future.
So this story is the first of 18 chapters in my new body of work titled "A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters."
And for this work, I traveled around the world over a four-year period researching and recording bloodlines and their related stories.
I was interested in ideas surrounding fate and whether our fate is determined by blood, chance or circumstance.
The subjects I documented ranged from feuding families in Brazil to victims of genocide in Bosnia to the first woman to hijack an airplane and the living dead in India.
In each chapter, you can see the external forces of governance, power and territory or religion colliding with the internal forces of psychological and physical inheritance.
Each work that I make is comprised of three segments.
On the left are one or more portrait panels in which I systematically order the members of a given bloodline.
This is followed by a text panel, it's designed in scroll form, in which I construct the narrative at stake.
And then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel.
It's a space that's more intuitive in which I present fragments of the story, beginnings of other stories, photographic evidence.
And it's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the Internet, in a less linear form.
So it's more disordered.
And this disorder is in direct contrast to the unalterable order of a bloodline.
In my past projects I've often worked in serial form, documenting things that have the appearance of being comprehensive through a determined title and a determined presentation, but in fact, are fairly abstract.
In this project I wanted to work in the opposite direction and find an absolute catalog, something that I couldn't interrupt, curate or edit by choice.
This led me to blood.
A bloodline is determined and ordered.
But the project centers on the collision of order and disorder -- the order of blood butting up against the disorder represented in the often chaotic and violent stories that are the subjects of my chapters.
In chapter two, I photograph the descendants of Arthur Ruppin.
He was sent in 1907 to Palestine by the Zionist organization to look at areas for Jewish settlement and acquire land for Jewish settlement.
He oversaw land acquisition on behalf of the Palestine Land Development Company whose work led to the establishment of a Jewish state.
Through my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem, I wanted to look at the early paperwork of the establishment of the Jewish state.
And I found these maps which you see here.
And these are studies commissioned by the Zionist organization for alternative areas for Jewish settlement.
In this, I was interested in the consequences of geography and imagining how the world would be different if Israel were in Uganda, which is what these maps demonstrate.
These archives in Jerusalem, they maintain a card index file of the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration to Palestine, and later Israel, from 1919 to 1965.
Chapter three: Joseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo treated patients outside of Kisumu, Kenya for AIDS, tuberculosis, infertility, mental illness, evil spirits.
He's most often paid for his services in cash, cows or goats.
But sometimes when his female patients can't afford his services, their families give the women to Jura in exchange for medical treatment.
As a result of these transactions, Jura has nine wives, 32 children and 63 grandchildren.
In his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here.
Two of his wives were brought to him suffering from infertility and he cured them, three for evil spirits, one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain and two wives Ondijo claims he took for love, paying their families a total of 16 cows.
One wife deserted him and another passed away during treatment for evil spirits.
Polygamy is widely practiced in Kenya.
It's common among a privileged class capable of paying numerous dowries and keeping multiple homes.
Instances of prominent social and political figures in polygamous relationships has led to the perception of polygamy as a symbol of wealth, status and power.
You may notice in several of the chapters that I photographed there are empty portraits.
These empty portraits represent individuals, living individuals, who couldn't be present.
And the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel.
They include dengue fever, imprisonment, army service, women not allowed to be photographed for religious and cultural reasons.
And in this particular chapter, it's children whose mothers wouldn't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it.
Twenty-four European rabbits were brought to Australia in 1859 by a British settler for sporting purposes, for hunting.
And within a hundred years, that population of 24 had exploded to half a billion.
The European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia, and it competes with native wildlife and damages native plants and degrades the land.
Since the 1950s, Australia has been introducing lethal diseases into the wild rabbit population to control growth.
These rabbits were bred at a government facility, Biosecurity Queensland, where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits and have infected them with a lethal disease and are monitoring their progress to see if it will effectively kill them.
So they're testing its virulence.
During the course of this trial, all of the rabbits died, except for a few, which were euthanized.
Haigh's Chocolate, in collaboration with the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia, stopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate and has replaced it with the Easter Bilby.
Now this was done to counter the annual celebration of rabbits and presumably make the public more comfortable with the killing of rabbits and promote an animal that's native to Australia, and actually an animal that is threatened by the European rabbit.
In chapter seven, I focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline.
So over a two-day period, six individuals from this bloodline were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.
This is the only work in which I visually represent the dead.
But I only represent those that were killed in the Srebrenica massacre, which is recorded as the largest mass murder in Europe since the Second World War.
And during this massacre, 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were systematically executed.
So when you look at a detail of this work, you can see, the man on the upper-left is the father of the woman sitting next to him.
Her name is Zumra.
She is followed by her four children, all of whom were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.
Following those four children is Zumra's younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well.
During the time I was in Bosnia, the mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave.
And I was therefore able to photograph the fully assembled remains.
However, the other individuals are represented by these blue slides, which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals.
They've all been given a proper burial, so what remains are these blue slides at the International Commission for Missing Persons.
These are personal effects dug up from a mass grave that are awaiting identification from family members and graffiti at the Potochari battery factory, which was where the Dutch U.N. soldiers were staying, and also the Serbian soldiers later during the times of the executions.
This is video footage used at the Milosevic trial, which from top to bottom shows a Serbian scorpion unit being blessed by an Orthodox priest before rounding up the boys and men and killing them.
Chapter 15 is more of a performance piece.
I solicited China's State Council Information Office in 2009 to select a multi-generational bloodline to represent China for this project.
They chose a large family from Beijing for its size, and they declined to give me any further reasoning for their choice.
This is one of the rare situations where I have no empty portraits.
Everyone showed up.
You can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy as it travels through the bloodline.
Previously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda, the State Council Information Office is responsible for all of China's external publicity operations.
It controls all foreign media and image production outside of China from foreign media working within China.
It also monitors the Internet and instructs local media on how to handle any potentially controversial issues, including Tibet, ethnic minorities, Human Rights, religion, democracy movements and terrorism.
For the footnote panel in this work, this office instructed me to photograph their central television tower in Beijing.
And I also photographed the gift bag they gave me when I left.
These are the descendants of Hans Frank who was Hitler's personal legal advisor and governor general of occupied Poland.
Now this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits, highlighting a complex relationship to one's family history.
The reasons for these absences include people who declined participation.
There's also parents who participated who wouldn't let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves.
Another section of the family presented their clothing, as opposed to their physical presence, because they didn't want to be identified with the past that I was highlighting.
And finally, another individual sat for me from behind and later rescinded his participation, so I had to pixelate him out so he's unrecognizable.
In the footnote panel that accompanies this work I photographed an official Adolph Hitler postage stamp and an imitation of that stamp produced by British Intelligence with Hans Frank's image on it.
It was released in Poland to create friction between Frank and Hitler, so that Hitler would imagine Frank was trying to usurp his power.
Again, talking about fate, I was interested in the stories and fate of particular works of art.
These paintings were taken by Hans Frank during the time of the Third Reich.
And I'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time.
They are Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady With an Ermine," Rembrandt's "Landscape With Good Samaritan" and Raphael's "Portrait of a Youth," which has never been found.
Chapter 12 highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making, but becomes their own.
So this is the Ferraz family and the Novaes family.
And they are in an active blood feud.
This feud has been going on since 1991 in Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco, and it involved the deaths of 20 members of the families and 40 others associated with the feud, including hired hit men, innocent bystanders and friends.
Tensions between these two families date back to 1913 when there was a dispute over local political power.
But it got violent in the last two decades and includes decapitation and the death of two mayors.
Installed into a protective wall surrounding the suburban home of Louis Novaes, who's the head of the Novaes family, are these turret holes, which were used for shooting and looking.
Brazil's northeast state of Pernambuco is one of the nation's most violent regions.
It's rooted in a principle of retributive justice, or an eye for an eye, so retaliatory killings have led to several deaths in the area.
This story, like many of the stories in my chapters, reads almost as an archetypal episode, like something out of Shakespeare, that's happening now and will happen again in the future.
I'm interested in these ideas of repetition.
So after I returned home, I received word that one member of the family had been shot 30 times in the face.
Chapter 17 is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline and the absence of a history.
Children at this Ukrainian orphanage are between the ages of six and 16.
This piece is ordered by age because it can't be ordered by blood.
In a 12-month period when I was at the orphanage, only one child had been adopted.
Children have to leave the orphanage at age 16, despite the fact that there's often nowhere for them to go.
It's commonly reported in Ukraine that children, when leaving the orphanage are targeted for human trafficking, child pornography and prostitution.
Many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival, and high rates of suicide are recorded.
This is a boys' bedroom.
There's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage and not enough warm clothing.
Children bathe infrequently because the hot water isn't turned on until October.
This is a girls' bedroom.
And the director listed the orphanage's most urgent needs as an industrial size washing machine and dryer, four vacuum cleaners, two computers, a video projector, a copy machine, winter shoes and a dentist's drill.
This photograph, which I took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms, shows a sign which I had translated when I got home.
And it reads: "Those who do not know their past are not worthy of their future."
There are many more chapters in this project.
This is just an abridged rendering of over a thousand images.
And this mass pile of images and stories forms an archive.
And within this accumulation of images and texts, I'm struggling to find patterns and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead are just as coded as blood itself.
But archives exist because there's something that can't necessarily be articulated.
Something is said in the gaps between all the information that's collected.
And there's this relentless persistence of birth and death and an unending collection of stories in between.
It's almost machine-like the way people are born and people die, and the stories keep coming and coming.
And in this, I'm considering, is this actual accumulation leading to some sort of evolution, or are we on repeat over and over again?
Thank you.

I'm not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning.
But anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater, and really I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation.
One of the interesting things, of course, is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology, and of course what he said about listening to our young people.
Of course, my job is all about listening, and my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen.
That's my only real aim in life.
And it sounds quite simple, but actually it's quite a big, big job.
Because you know, when you look at a piece of music -- for example, if I just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here, hopefully, a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page.
And, you know, we open it up and I read the music.
So technically, I can actually read this.
I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics.
I will do exactly as I'm told.
And so therefore, because time is short, if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so. It's very straightforward.
There's nothing too difficult about the piece.
But here I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick.
I'm being told where to play on the drum.
I'm being told which part of the stick to use.
And I'm being told the dynamic.
And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares.
Snares on, snares off.
So therefore, if I translate this piece of music, we have this idea.
And so on. My career would probably last about five years.
However, what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music.
Everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher, or to talk about, even, from a teacher.
But it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting, and that you want to explore through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.
So there, we experience the translation. Now we'll experience the interpretation.
Now my career may last a little longer!
But in a way, you know, it's the same if I look at you and I see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on.
I see that you're clutching a teddy bear, etc., etc.
So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about, what you might like, what you might do as a profession, etc., etc.
However, that's just, you know, the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look, and we try to interpret, but actually it's so unbelievably shallow.
In the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea; I wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do.
Just the basic feeling.
However, that is simply not enough.
And I think what Herbie said -- please listen, listen.
We have to listen to ourselves, first of all.
If I play, for example, holding the stick -- where literally I do not let go of the stick -- you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm.
And you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- detached from the instrument and from the stick, even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly.
By holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached.
If I just simply let go and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system, suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more.
And I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum.
And I'm doing far, far less.
So in the same way that I need time with this instrument, I need time with people in order to interpret them.
Not just translate them, but interpret them.
If, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician -- that is, someone who is basically a percussion player ...
And so on. If I think of myself as a musician ...
And so on. There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- -- thinking about.
And I remember when I was 12 years old, and I started playing tympani and percussion, and my teacher said, "Well, how are we going to do this? You know, music is about listening."
And I said, "Yes, I agree with that. So what's the problem?"
And he said, "Well, how are you going to hear this? How are you going to hear that?"
And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?"
He said, "Well, I think I hear it through here."
And I said, "Well, I think I do too -- but I also hear it through my hands, through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp, my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on."
And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums -- in particular, the kettle drums, or tympani -- to such a narrow pitch interval, so something like ...
that of a difference. Then gradually ... and gradually ...
and it's amazing that when you do open your body up, and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through, that in fact the tiny, tiny difference ...
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there.
And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room, and together we would "listen" to the sounds of the instruments, and really try to connect with those sounds far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear.
Because of course, the ear is, I mean, subject to all sorts of things.
The room we happen to be in, the amplification, the quality of the instrument, the type of sticks ... etc., etc.
They're all different.
Same amount of weight, but different sound colors.
And that's basically what we are. We're just human beings, but we all have our own little sound colors, as it were, that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things.
And as I grew older, I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London, and they said, "Well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue, you know, of the future of a so-called 'deaf' musician."
And I just couldn't quite accept that.
And so therefore, I said to them, "Well, look, if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons, as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."
And as a result -- once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice -- they accepted me. And not only that -- what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom.
Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms, no legs -- they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand.
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry.
And every single entry had to be listened to, experienced and then based on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not.
So therefore, this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions.
And I have to say, many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world.
The interesting thing about this as well, though -- -- is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound -- which is basically all of us, and we well know that music really is our daily medicine.
I say "music," but actually I mean "sound."
Because you know, some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician, when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges, who may not be able to control his movements, who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. -- suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument, and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba, and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost -- I don't really have the right sticks, perhaps -- but something like this. Let me change.
Something that's so unbelievably simple -- but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be, because I'm on top of the sound.
I have the sound coming this way.
He would have the sound coming through the resonators.
If there were no resonators on here, we would have ...
So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience, those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience either.
Every single one of us, depending on where we're sitting, will experience this sound quite, quite differently.
And of course, being the participator of the sound, and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce -- for example, this sound.
Can you hear anything?
Exactly. Because I'm not even touching it.
But yet, we get the sensation of something happening.
In the same way that when I see tree moves, then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound.
Do you see what I mean?
Whatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening.
So there's always, always that huge -- I mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from.
So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience, and not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it, buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth.
Because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic, and something that I can fully experience the journey of.
So it may be that, in certain halls, this dynamic may well work.
It may be that in other halls, they're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore, my level of soft, gentle playing may have to be ...
Do you see what I mean? So, because of this explosion in access to sound, especially through the deaf community, this has not only affected how music institutions, how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy -- although of course, being a participator of music, that definitely is the case as well.
But it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics, dare I say. But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine.
The tiniest, softest, softest sound to something that is so broad, so huge, so incredible! There's always something -- it may sound good up there, may not be so good there.
May be great there, but terrible up there.
Maybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc.
So to find an actual hall is incredible -- for which you can play exactly what you imagine, without it being cosmetically enhanced.
And so therefore, acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired, and who are participators of sound.
And this is quite interesting.
I cannot, you know, give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years we've been saying, "Well, how on Earth can they experience music? You know, they're deaf."
We just -- we go like that, and we imagine that that's what deafness is about.
Or we go like that, and we imagine that's what blindness is about.
If we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk.
It may be that they can walk three, four, five steps. That, to them, means they can walk.
In a year's time, it could be two extra steps.
In another year's time, three extra steps.
Those are hugely important aspects to think about.
So when we do listen to each other, it's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills, to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber, to stop the judgment.
For me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music, it's very easy for me to say, "Oh yes, I like that piece.
Oh no, I don't like that piece." And so on.
And you know, I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time.
It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music, but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music.
And you know, it's just one of the great things about being a musician, is that it is so unbelievably fluid.
So there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way.
If I asked you to clap -- maybe I can do this.
If I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder."
I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder.
Now, I don't mean just the sound; I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves.
And please try to create that through your clapping. Try. Just -- please try.
Very good! Snow. Snow. Have you ever heard snow?
Audience: No.
Evelyn Glennie: Well then, stop clapping. Try again.
Try again. Snow.
See, you're awake.
Rain. Not bad. Not bad.
You know, the interesting thing here, though, is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question.
Now -- great imagination, thank you very much.
However, not one of you got out of your seats to think, "Right! How can I clap? OK, maybe ...
Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds.
Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds."
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands.
In the same way that when we listen to music, we assume that it's all being fed through here.
This is how we experience music. Of course it's not.
We experience thunder -- thunder, thunder. Think, think, think.
Listen, listen, listen. Now -- what can we do with thunder?
I remember my teacher. When I first started, my very first lesson, I was all prepared with sticks, ready to go.
And instead of him saying, "OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart, arms at a more-or-less 90 degree angle, sticks in a more-or-less V shape, keep this amount of space here, etc.
Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." -- where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen, and I would not be able to strike the drum, because I was thinking of so many other things -- he said, "Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days, and I'll see you next week."
So, heavens! What was I to do? I no longer required the sticks; I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.
I had to basically look at this particular drum, see how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did.
Turned it upside down, experimented with the shell, experimented with the head.
Experimented with my body, experimented with jewelry, experimented with all sorts of things.
And of course, I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that -- but nevertheless, it was such an unbelievable experience, because then, where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music?
Where on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book?
So we never, ever dealt with actual study books.
So for example, one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player, as opposed to a musician, is basically straightforward single stroke rolls.
Like that. And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster.
And so on and so forth. What does this piece require?
Single stroke rolls. So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music?
And that's exactly what he did.
And interestingly, the older I became, and when I became a full-time student at a so called "music institution," all of that went out of the window.
We had to study from study books.
And constantly, the question, "Well, why? Why? What is this relating to?
I need to play a piece of music." "Oh, well, this will help your control!"
"Well, how? Why do I need to learn that? I need to relate it to a piece of music.
You know. I need to say something.
"Why am I practicing paradiddles?
Is it just literally for control, for hand-stick control? Why am I doing that?
I need to have the reason, and the reason has to be by saying something through the music."
And by saying something through music, which basically is sound, we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people.
But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage.
That's up to you, when you walk through a hall.
Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things.
I may feel sorrowful, or happy, or exhilarated, or angry when I play certain pieces of music, but I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing.
So please, the next time you go to a concert, just allow your body to open up, allow your body to be this resonating chamber.
Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is.
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound, because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum, or the mallet on the bit of wood, or the bow on the string, etc., or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass.
They're experiencing that rawness there.
But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure, which is before the sound is actually happening.
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike, or breath, is being pulled. Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night.
But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses.
But thank you very much for having me!

Ever since I was a little girl seeing "Star Wars" for the first time, I've been fascinated by this idea of personal robots.
And as a little girl, I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful, trusted sidekick -- something that would delight us, enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two.
I knew robots like that didn't really exist, but I knew I wanted to build them.
So 20 years pass -- I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence, the year is 1997, and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars.
But robots are still not in our home, ironically.
And I remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case.
But one really struck me.
Robotics had really been about interacting with things, not with people -- certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives.
For me, that was the white space; that's what robots could not do yet.
And so that year, I started to build this robot, Kismet, the world's first social robot.
Three years later -- a lot of programming, working with other graduate students in the lab -- Kismet was ready to start interacting with people.
Scientist: I want to show you something.
Kismet: Scientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me.
Kismet: Scientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too.
I almost lost it this week.
Cynthia Breazeal: So Kismet interacted with people like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child, which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind.
It didn't speak language, but it didn't matter.
This little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us -- and with that, the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots.
So over the past several years I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots, now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students.
And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo.
We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio.
And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo.
This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo, introducing Leo to a new object.
And because it's new, Leo doesn't really know what to make of it.
But sort of like us, he can actually learn about it from watching Matt's reaction.
Matt Berlin: Hello, Leo.
Leo, this is Cookie Monster.
Can you find Cookie Monster?
Leo, Cookie Monster is very bad.
He's very bad, Leo.
Cookie Monster is very, very bad.
He's a scary monster.
He wants to get your cookies.
CB: All right, so Leo and Cookie might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start, but they get along great now.
So what I've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology, where it's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality.
And with that shift in thinking, we can now start to imagine new questions, new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise.
But what do I mean when I say "push our social buttons?"
Well, one of the things that we've learned is that, if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language, the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use -- like Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here -- what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people.
People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is, how likable, how engaging, how trustworthy.
It turns out it's the same for robots.
It's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior.
To answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter, we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is?
Mimicry's believed to play a role, but how?
Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters?
It turns out it's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically.
We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us.
But with the robot, you can.
And so in this video here -- this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University.
He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with.
There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues to be able to study this question.
And the bottom line is -- the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot.
So given that key insight, we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots.
For instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues, maybe they would be a cool, new communication technology.
So imagine this: What about a robot accessory for your cellphone?
You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot, and, bam! You're a MeBot -- you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends, you can move around, you can gesture -- maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it?
To explore this question, my student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study where we brought human participants, people, into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator.
The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table, discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task -- this ended up being a survival task -- and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were.
The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants.
The first was just the screen.
This is just like video conferencing today.
The next was to add mobility -- so, have the screen on a mobile base.
This is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today -- this is mirroring that situation.
And then the fully expressive MeBot.
So after the interaction, we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology, with a remote collaborator through this technology, in a number of different ways.
We looked at psychological involvement -- how much empathy did you feel for the other person?
We looked at overall engagement.
We looked at their desire to cooperate.
And this is what we see when they use just the screen.
It turns out, when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table -- you get a little more of a boost.
And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression.
So it seems like this physical, social embodiment actually really makes a difference.
Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context.
Today we know that families are living further and further apart, and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance.
For me, I have three young boys, and I want them to have a really good relationship with their grandparents.
But my parents live thousands of miles away, so they just don't get to see each other that often.
We try Skype, we try phone calls, but my boys are little -- they don't really want to talk; they want to play.
So I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance-play technology.
I imagine a time not too far from now -- my mom can go to her computer, open up a browser and jack into a little robot.
And as grandma-bot, she can now play, really play, with my sons, with her grandsons, in the real world with his real toys.
I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays with their granddaughters, with their friends, and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house, like sharing a bedtime story.
And through this technology, being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren's lives in a way that's not possible today.
Let's think about some other domains, like maybe health.
So in the United States today, over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese, and now it's a big problem with our children as well.
And we know that as you get older in life, if you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseases that not only reduce your quality of life, but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system.
But if robots can be engaging, if we like to cooperate with robots, if robots are persuasive, maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program, maybe they can help you manage your weight.
Sort of like a digital Jiminy -- as in the well-known fairy tale -- a kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits.
So we actually explored this idea in our lab.
This is a robot, Autom.
Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work.
And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach.
It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do.
It could make eye contact with you.
It could share information looking down at a screen.
You'd use a screen interface to enter information, like how many calories you ate that day, how much exercise you got.
And then it could help track that for you.
And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth.
And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue.
It could help you set goals and track your progress, and it would help motivate you.
So an interesting question is, does the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot?
Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters?
To explore that question, we did a study in the Boston area where we put one of three interventions in people's homes for a period of several weeks.
One case was the robot you saw there, Autom.
Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface, ran exactly the same dialogues.
The quality of advice was identical.
And the third was just a pen and paper log, because that's the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet-and-exercise program.
So one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost, but really how long they interacted with the robot.
Because the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off.
And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions, well that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success.
So the first thing I want to look at is how long, how long did people interact with these systems.
It turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more, even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer.
When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance, people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more.
And when you look at emotional engagement, it was completely different.
People would name the robots.
They would dress the robots.
And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study, they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots.
They didn't do this with a computer.
The last thing I want to talk about today is the future of children's media.
We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today, whether it's television or computer games or whatnot.
My sons, they love the screen. They love the screen.
But I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play, like, real-world play.
And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Playtime Computing that's really trying to think about how we can take what's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child, where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play.
So here's the first exploration of this idea, where characters can be physical or virtual, and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back.
I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended-reality play.
But we can push this idea further.
What if -- Nathan: Here it comes. Yay!
CB: -- the character itself could come into your world?
It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world.
And when it's in their world, they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen.
Another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities.
So changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world.
So here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2.
You can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world.
So they are now sending the character back into that world.
And now it's got number power.
And then finally, what I've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids, where they really feel like they are part of that story, a part of that experience.
And I really want to spark their imaginations the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching "Star Wars."
But I want to do more than that.
I actually want them to create those experiences.
I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own.
So we've been exploring a lot of ideas in telepresence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space where other kids can interact with them and build upon them.
I really want to come up with new ways of children's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation.
I think that's very, very important.
So this is a new project.
We've invited a lot of kids into this space, and they think it's pretty cool.
But I can tell you, the thing that they love the most is the robot.
What they care about is the robot.
Robots touch something deeply human within us.
And so whether they're helping us to become creative and innovative, or whether they're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance, or whether they are our trusted sidekick who's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves, for me, robots are all about people.
Thank you.

I'm a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums.
I show a number of photographs and films, but I also make television programs, books and some advertising, all with the same concept.
And it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture, and the importance of the image: celebrity is born of photography.
I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago, when Princess Diana died.
There was a sort of a standstill in Britain the moment of her death, and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way.
I was fascinated by this phenomenon, so I wondered: could one erase the image of Diana, actually quite crudely and physically?
So, I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana, but I couldn't erase this from my memory and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche.
Momentum was being built.
The press wrote about her death in rather, I felt, pornographic ways -- like, "Which bit of artery left which bit of body?"
and "How did she die in the back of the car?" -- and I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism, so I made these rather gory images.
I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image, so I got a look-alike of Diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in, or existed in, the public imagination.
So people were wondering: was she going to marry Dodi?
Was she in love with him?
Was she pregnant? Did she want his baby?
Was she pregnant when she died?
So I created this image of Diana, Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child and this image came out, which caused a huge public outcry at the time.
I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery, so I started making reference to media imagery -- made it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth -- to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism.
So, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband, and this was a sequence of images.
And this gets shown in art galleries like this, as a sequence.
And similarly with the Di-Dodian baby imagery -- this is another art gallery installation.
I'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception.
This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance, but you think it's Camilla and the Queen, and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real.
And the camera can lie, and it makes it very, very easy with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths.
So, I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter.
And at the same time, it removes us from the real subject matter, and this acts as a sort of titillating thing.
So, the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism; what you can't have, you want more.
In the photograph, the real subject doesn't exist so it makes you want that person more.
And that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now: the more pictures you see of these celebrities, the more you feel you know them, but you don't know them and you want to know them further.
Of course, the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...
watch her horses. .
And then I was sort of making imagery.
In England there's an expression: "you can't imagine the Queen on the loo."
So I'm trying to penetrate that.
Well, here is the image.
All this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and I was cited as a disgusting artist. The press were writing about this, giving full pages about how terrible this was.
Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle: I was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media -- because we don't know the real people; very few of us know the real people -- but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing, effectively, my filthy work.
So, these are broadsheets, tabloids, debates were being had all about this work, films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work, politicians were getting involved -- all sorts of things -- great headlines.
Then suddenly, it started to get on front pages.
I was being asked and paid to do front covers.
Suddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable, which I found also fascinating.
How one moment -- it was disgusting -- journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me, saying my work was wonderful, and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me.
But then this changed suddenly.
I then started to work for magazines and newspapers.
This was, for example, an image that went into Tatler.
This was another newspaper image.
It was an April fool actually, and to this day some people think it's real.
I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day, and they were saying there's this great image of the Queen sitting outside William Hill.
They thought it was real.
I was exploring, at the time, the hyperbole of icons -- and Diana and Marilyn -- and the importance of celebrity in our lives.
How they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing, and how that should happen.
I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself.
There's me as Diana -- I look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley, I think, in this one. .
And me as the Queen.
I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn -- the biggest icon of all -- and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth, and only showing certain angles to create a reality that, obviously, is completely constructed.
This is the look-alike, so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous.
She looks nothing like Marilyn, but by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on, she looks exactly like Marilyn, to the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her -- or recognize this look-alike -- in these photographs, which I find quite interesting.
So, all this work is getting shown in art galleries.
Then I made a book.
I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time.
Stills from the TV series went into this book.
But there was a real legal problem because it looks real, but how do you get over that?
Because obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now: that we can't tell what's real.
How do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not?
So, from my point of view, it's important to publish it, but at the same time it does cause a confusion -- intentional on my behalf, but problematic for any outlet that I'm working with.
So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do, and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities and comments about our public figures.
You know, what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru?
And also dealing with the perceptions that are put about Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, the links that were put about pre-Iraq war.
And what is going to happen to the monarchy?
Because obviously the British public, I think, would prefer William to Charles on the throne.
And it's that wish, or that desire, that I suppose I'm dealing with in my work.
I'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves.
I'm interested in the perception of the celebrity.
And with some look-alikes, they are so good you don't know whether they're real or not.
I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes, which is Coca-Cola, and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities.
It's highly commercial.
But it was a difficulty for me -- because this is my artwork; should I do advertising? -- at the time.
So I made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same.
But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on, you're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that's all you're doing.
When you take the logo off, you're opening up the interpretations and making the work inconclusive, opposed to conclusive when you are advertising.
This image is quite interesting, actually, because I think we made it three years ago.
And it's Camilla in her wedding dress, which, again, nearly got re-used now, recently prior to her wedding.
Tony Blair and Cherie. And again, the legalities -- we had to be very careful.
It's obviously a very big commercial company, and so this little, "Shh -- it's not really them," was put on the side of the imagery.
And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail.
I then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them, so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes -- live scenes with look-alikes inside the windows, and the windows were all steamed up.
So, it's Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech; I've got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin; Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson, who he was having an affair with at that time.
This was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper, broadsheets and tabloids.
It was a bit of a road stopper, which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds, but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance.
Also, people were taking photographs of this, so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly, all this imagery.
And the press were interviewing, and I was signing my book. .
Further imagery. I'm making a new book now with Taschen that I'm working on really for a sort of global market -- my previous book was only for the U.K. market -- that I suppose it could be called humorous.
I suppose I come from a sort of non-humorous background with serious intent, and then suddenly my work is funny.
And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way; I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery.
It's an extremely fast way of getting information.
It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly, and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery.
This image, for example, is sort of spot-on because it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private, and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein, and George Bush reading the Koran upside-down.
For example, George Bush target practice -- shooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore.
And then you change the photograph he's shooting at, and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible. .
Tony Blair being used as a mounting block, and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind, and the seriousness, or the intellect, of Bush.
And also, commenting on the behind the scenes -- well, as we know now -- what goes on in prisons.
And in fact, George Bush and Tony Blair are having great fun during all of this.
And really commenting, you know, based on the perception we have of the celebrities.
What Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life, and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage and golf-clubbed a driver the other day.
I mean, it's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes, so I'm constantly going up to people in the street and trying to ask people to come and be in one of my photographs or films.
And sometimes asking the real celebrity, mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person, which is highly embarrassing. .
I've also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis -- a page a week in their newspaper -- which has been very interesting, working topically.
So, Jamie Oliver and school dinners; Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture; the whole of the hunting issue, and the royal family refusing to stop hunting; and the tsunami issues; and obviously Harry; Blair's views on Gordon Brown, which I find very interesting; Condi and Bush.
This image I've decided to show having a reservation about it.
I made it a year ago. And just how meanings change, and there were a terrible thing that has happened, but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that.
That's why this image was made one year ago, and what it means today.
So, I'll leave you with these clips to have a look.
Thank you.

I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is.
Autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe -- the child remains non-verbal -- all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers.
And I actually feel at home here, because there's a lot of autism genetics here.
You wouldn't have any...
It's a continuum of traits.
When does a nerd turn into Asperger, which is just mild autism?
I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today.
And one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things, you know, that Bill Gates talked about this morning.
OK. Now, if you want to understand autism, animals.
And I want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking.
You have to get away from verbal language.
I think in pictures, I don't think in language.
Now, the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details.
OK, this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters, or pick out the little letters, and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly.
And the thing is, the normal brain ignores the details.
Well, if you're building a bridge, details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignore the details.
And one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract.
People are getting away from doing hands-on stuff.
I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes, because art, and classes like that, those are the classes where I excelled.
In my work with cattle, I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle balk. Like, for example, this flag waving, right in front of the veterinary facility.
This feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility; all they needed to do was move the flag.
Rapid movement, contrast.
In the early '70s when I started, I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing.
People thought that was crazy. A coat on a fence would make them balk, shadows would make them balk, a hose on the floor ...
people weren't noticing these things -- a chain hanging down -- and that's shown very, very nicely in the movie.
In fact, I loved the movie, how they duplicated all my projects. That's the geek side.
My drawings got to star in the movie too.
And actually it's called "Temple Grandin," not "Thinking In Pictures."
So, what is thinking in pictures? It's literally movies in your head.
My mind works like Google for images.
Now, when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different.
I thought everybody thought in pictures.
And then when I did my book, "Thinking In Pictures," I start interviewing people about how they think.
And I was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different. Like if I say, "Think about a church steeple" most people get this sort of generalized generic one.
Now, maybe that's not true in this room, but it's going to be true in a lot of different places.
I see only specific pictures.
They flash up into my memory, just like Google for pictures.
And in the movie, they've got a great scene in there where the word "shoe" is said, and a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes pop into my imagination.
OK, there is my childhood church, that's specific. There's some more, Fort Collins.
OK, how about famous ones?
And they just kind of come up, kind of like this.
Just really quickly, like Google for pictures.
And they come up one at a time, and then I think, "OK, well maybe we can have it snow, or we can have a thunderstorm," and I can hold it there and turn them into videos.
Now, visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle-handling facilities.
And I've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant.
I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides.
I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it.
But, one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind, just like a virtual reality computer system.
And this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie.
That was like just so super cool.
and autism types working out there on the movie set too.
But one of the things that really worries me is: Where's the younger version of those kids going today?
They're not ending up in Silicon Valley, where they belong.
Now, one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social, is I had to sell my work, and not myself.
And the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings, I showed off pictures of things.
Another thing that helped me as a little kid is, boy, in the '50s, you were taught manners.
You were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in the store and throw it around.
Now, when kids get to be in third or fourth grade, you might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker, drawing in perspective. Now, I want to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker.
Now, I had this brain scan done several years ago, and I used to joke around about having a gigantic Internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex.
This is tensor imaging.
And my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the control's.
The red lines there are me, and the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control.
And there I got a gigantic one, and the control over there, the blue one, has got a really small one.
And some of the research now is showing is that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex.
Now, the thing is, the visual thinker's just one kind of mind.
You see, the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind -- good at one thing, bad at something else.
And where I was bad was algebra. And I was never allowed to take geometry or trig.
Gigantic mistake: I'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra, go right to geometry and trig.
Now, another kind of mind is the pattern thinker.
More abstract. These are your engineers, your computer programmers.
Now, this is pattern thinking. That praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper -- no scotch tape, no cuts.
And there in the background is the pattern for folding it.
Here are the types of thinking: photo-realistic visual thinkers, like me; pattern thinkers, music and math minds.
Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading.
You also will see these kind of problems with kids that are dyslexic.
You'll see these different kinds of minds.
And then there's a verbal mind, they know every fact about everything.
Now, another thing is the sensory issues.
I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face.
And I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it, and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin.
But sensory is an issue. Some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights; others have problems with sound sensitivity.
You know, it's going to be variable.
Now, visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind.
Because think about it: An animal is a sensory-based thinker, not verbal -- thinks in pictures, thinks in sounds, thinks in smells.
Think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant.
He knows who's been there, when they were there.
Are they friend or foe? Is there anybody he can go mate with?
There's a ton of information on that fire hydrant.
It's all very detailed information, and, looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals.
Now, the animal mind, and also my mind, puts sensory-based information into categories.
Man on a horse and a man on the ground -- that is viewed as two totally different things.
You could have a horse that's been abused by a rider.
They'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horseshoer, but you can't ride him.
You have another horse, where maybe the horseshoer beat him up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground, with the veterinarian, but a person can ride him.
Cattle are the same way.
Man on a horse, a man on foot -- they're two different things.
You see, it's a different picture.
See, I want you to think about just how specific this is.
Now, this ability to put information into categories, I find a lot of people are not very good at this.
When I'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant, they don't seem to be able to figure out, "Do I have a training people issue?
Or do I have something wrong with the equipment?"
In other words, categorize equipment problem from a people problem.
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that.
Now, let's say I figure out it's an equipment problem.
Is it a minor problem, with something simple I can fix?
Or is the whole design of the system wrong?
People have a hard time figuring that out.
Let's just look at something like, you know, solving problems with making airlines safer.
Yeah, I'm a million-mile flyer.
I do lots and lots of flying, and if I was at the FAA, what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of?
It would be their airplane tails.
You know, five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years, the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way.
It's tails, pure and simple.
And when the pilots walk around the plane, guess what? They can't see that stuff inside the tail.
You know, now as I think about that, I'm pulling up all of that specific information.
It's specific. See, my thinking's bottom-up.
I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle.
Now, here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats.
He'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat.
White cowboy hats, that was absolutely fine.
Now, the thing is, the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together.
We've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds.
And one of the things that is driving me really crazy, as I travel around and I do autism meetings, is I'm seeing a lot of smart, geeky, nerdy kids, and they just aren't very social, and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science.
And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher.
My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie.
I was a goofball student. When I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying, until I had Mr. Carlock's science class.
He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.
And he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room.
This brings up the whole thing of you've got to show kids interesting stuff.
You know, one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED, and there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on.
Because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids, and the teachers out in the Midwest, and the other parts of the country, when you get away from these tech areas, they don't know what to do with these kids.
And they're not going down the right path.
The thing is, you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind, or your mind can be wired to be more social.
And what some of the research now has shown in autism is there may by extra wiring back here, in the really brilliant mind, and we lose a few social circuits here.
It's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social.
And then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be non-verbal.
In the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals.
This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller.
And he studied Alzheimer's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia.
And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain, and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars.
Now, Van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics, but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this eddy pattern in this painting followed a statistical model of turbulence, which brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head.
And the Wolfram stuff -- I was taking notes and I was writing down all the search words I could use, because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures.
We've got to show these kids interesting stuff.
And they've taken out the autoshop class and the drafting class and the art class.
I mean art was my best subject in school.
We've got to think about all these different kinds of minds, and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds, because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future.
And let's talk about jobs.
OK, my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball that didn't want to study.
But you know what? I was getting work experience.
I'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things, like how to be on time.
I was taught that when I was eight years old.
You know, how to have table manners at granny's Sunday party.
I was taught that when I was very, very young.
And when I was 13, I had a job at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes.
I did internships in college, I was building things, and I also had to learn how to do assignments.
You know, all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little.
My mother said, "Well let's do a picture of something else."
They've got to learn how to do something else.
Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos.
Let's get him working on building different things.
The thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated.
Like if a kid loves racecars, let's use racecars for math.
Let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance.
In other words, use that fixation in order to motivate that kid, that's one of the things we need to do.
I really get fed up when they, you know, the teachers, especially when you get away from this part of the country, they don't know what to do with these smart kids.
It just drives me crazy.
What can visual thinkers do when they grow up?
They can do graphic design, all kinds of stuff with computers, photography, industrial design.
The pattern thinkers, they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians, your software engineers, your computer programmers, all of those kinds of jobs.
And then you've got the word minds. They make great journalists, and they also make really, really good stage actors.
Because the thing about being autistic is, I had to learn social skills like being in a play.
It's just kind of -- you just have to learn it.
And we need to be working with these students.
And this brings up mentors.
You know, my science teacher was not an accredited teacher.
He was a NASA space scientist.
Now, some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology, or a degree in chemistry, you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry.
We need to be doing that.
Because what I'm observing is the good teachers, for a lot of these kids, are out in the community colleges, but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools.
Another thing that can be very, very, very successful is there is a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry, and they can teach your kid.
And it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old, because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark.
You're getting that kid turned on.
And you get him turned on, then he'll learn all the new stuff.
Mentors are just essential.
I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me.
And we've got to mentor them, hire them.
And if you bring them in for internships in your companies, the thing about the autism, Asperger-y kind of mind, you've got to give them a specific task. Don't just say, "Design new software."
You've got to tell them something a lot more specific: "Well, we're designing a software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing.
And it can only use so much memory."
That's the kind of specificity you need.
Well, that's the end of my talk.
And I just want to thank everybody for coming.
It was great to be here.
Oh, you've got a question for me? OK.
Thank you so much for that.
You know, you once wrote, I like this quote, "If by some magic, autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth, then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave."
Temple Grandin: Because who do you think made the first stone spears?
The Asperger guy. And if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics there would be no more Silicon Valley, and the energy crisis would not be solved.
So, I want to ask you a couple other questions, and if any of these feel inappropriate, it's okay just to say, "Next question."
But if there is someone here who has an autistic child, or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them, what advice would you give them?
TG: Well, first of all, you've got to look at age.
If you have a two, three or four year old you know, no speech, no social interaction, I can't emphasize enough: Don't wait, you need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching.
You know, the thing is, autism comes in different degrees.
There's going to be about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn to talk, and they're not going to be working Silicon Valley, that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do.
But then you get the smart, geeky kids that have a touch of autism, and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things.
I got social interaction through shared interest.
I rode horses with other kids, I made model rockets with other kids, did electronics lab with other kids, and in the '60s, it was gluing mirrors onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show.
That was like, we considered that super cool.
Is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them, as some might, as most, wish?
TG: Well let me tell you, that child will be loyal, and if your house is burning down, they're going to get you out of it.
Wow. So, most people, if you ask them what are they most passionate about, they'd say things like, "My kids" or "My lover."
What are you most passionate about?
TG: I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place.
When I have a mother of an autistic child say, "My kid went to college because of your book, or one of your lectures," that makes me happy.
You know, the slaughter plants, I've worked with them in the '80s; they were absolutely awful.
I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes: How many cattle fell down?
How many cattle got poked with the prodder?
How many cattle are mooing their heads off?
And it's very, very simple.
You directly observe a few simple things.
It's worked really well. I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world. We need a lot more of that, and a lot less abstract stuff.
When we were talking on the phone, one of the things you said that really astonished me was you said one thing you were passionate about was server farms. Tell me about that.
TG: Well the reason why I got really excited when I read about that, it contains knowledge.
It's libraries.
And to me, knowledge is something that is extremely valuable. So, maybe, over 10 years ago now our library got flooded.
And this is before the Internet got really big.
And I was really upset about all the books being wrecked, because it was knowledge being destroyed.
And server farms, or data centers are great libraries of knowledge.
Temple, can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at TED.
TG: Well thank you so much. Thank you.

<title>Temple Grandin: The world needs all kinds of minds</title>
<description>Temple Grandin, diagnosed with autism as a child, talks about how her mind works -- sharing her ability to "think in pictures," which helps her solve problems that neurotypical brains might miss. She makes the case that the world needs people on the autism spectrum: visual thinkers, pattern thinkers, verbal thinkers, and all kinds of smart geeky kids.</description>
<keywords>animals,brain,design,education,invention,mental health,science,technology</keywords>

It's the fifth time I stand on this shore, the Cuban shore, looking out at that distant horizon, believing, again, that I'm going to make it all the way across that vast, dangerous wilderness of an ocean.
Not only have I tried four times, but the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since 1950, and it's still never been done.
The team is proud of our four attempts.
It's an expedition of some 30 people.
Bonnie is my best friend and head handler, who somehow summons will, that last drop of will within me, when I think it's gone, after many, many hours and days out there.
The shark experts are the best in the world -- large predators below.
The box jellyfish, the deadliest venom in all of the ocean, is in these waters, and I have come close to dying from them on a previous attempt.
The conditions themselves, besides the sheer distance of over 100 miles in the open ocean -- the currents and whirling eddies and the Gulf Stream itself, the most unpredictable of all of the planet Earth.
And by the way, it's amusing to me that journalists and people before these attempts often ask me, "Well, are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything?"
And I'm thinking, what are they imagining?
That I'll just sort of do some celestial navigation, and carry a bowie knife in my mouth, and I'll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them, and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water.
Yes, I have a team.
And the team is expert, and the team is courageous, and brimming with innovation and scientific discovery, as is true with any major expedition on the planet.
And we've been on a journey.
And the debate has raged, hasn't it, since the Greeks, of isn't it what it's all about?
Isn't life about the journey, not really the destination?
And here we've been on this journey, and the truth is, it's been thrilling.
We haven't reached that other shore, and still our sense of pride and commitment, unwavering commitment.
When I turned 60, the dream was still alive from having tried this in my 20s, and dreamed it and imagined it.
The most famous body of water on the Earth today, I imagine, Cuba to Florida.
And it was deep. It was deep in my soul.
And when I turned 60, it wasn't so much about the athletic accomplishment, it wasn't the ego of "I want to be the first."
That's always there and it's undeniable.
But it was deeper. It was, how much life is there left?
Let's face it, we're all on a one-way street, aren't we, and what are we going to do?
What are we going to do as we go forward to have no regrets looking back?
And all this past year in training, I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote to paraphrase it, floating around in my brain, and it says, "You go ahead, you go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair and you be the critic, you be the observer, while the brave one gets in the ring and engages and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails over and over and over again, but yet isn't afraid and isn't timid and lives life in a bold way."
And so of course I want to make it across.
It is the goal, and I should be so shallow to say that this year, the destination was even sweeter than the journey.
But the journey itself was worthwhile taking.
And at this point, by this summer, everybody -- scientists, sports scientists, endurance experts, neurologists, my own team, Bonnie -- said it's impossible.
It just simply can't be done, and Bonnie said to me, "But if you're going to take the journey, I'm going to see you through to the end of it, so I'll be there."
And now we're there.
And as we're looking out, kind of a surreal moment before the first stroke, standing on the rocks at Marina Hemingway, the Cuban flag is flying above, all my team's out in their boats, hands up in the air, "We're here, we're here for you," Bonnie and I look at each other, and we say, this year, the mantra is -- and I've been using it in training -- find a way.
You have a dream and you have obstacles in front of you, as we all do.
None of us ever get through this life without heartache, without turmoil, and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a great human quality, you find your way, and Bonnie grabbed my shoulders, and she said, "Let's find our way to Florida."
And we started, and for the next 53 hours, it was an intense, unforgettable life experience.
The highs were high, the awe, I'm not a religious person, but I'll tell you, to be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream as if, as you're breathing, you're looking down miles and miles and miles, to feel the majesty of this blue planet we live on, it's awe-inspiring.
I have a playlist of about 85 songs, and especially in the middle of the night, and that night, because we use no lights -- lights attract jellyfish, lights attract sharks, lights attract baitfish that attract sharks, so we go in the pitch black of the night.
You've never seen black this black.
You can't see the front of your hand, and the people on the boat, Bonnie and my team on the boat, they just hear the slapping of the arms, and they know where I am, because there's no visual at all.
And I'm out there kind of tripping out on my little playlist.
I've got a tight rubber cap, so I don't hear a thing.
I've got goggles and I'm turning my head 50 times a minute, and I'm singing, Imagine there's no heaven doo doo doo doo doo It's easy if you try doo doo doo doo doo And I can sing that song a thousand times in a row.
Now there's a talent unto itself.
And each time I get done with Ooh, you may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one 222.
Imagine there's no heaven And when I get through the end of a thousand of John Lennon's "Imagine," I have swum nine hours and 45 minutes, exactly.
And then there are the crises. Of course there are.
And the vomiting starts, the seawater, you're not well, you're wearing a jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection.
It's difficult to swim in.
It's causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth, but the tentacles can't get you.
And the hypothermia sets in.
The water's 85 degrees, and yet you're losing weight and using calories, and as you come over toward the side of the boat, not allowed to touch it, not allowed to get out, but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition and asks me what I'm doing, am I all right, I am seeing the Taj Mahal over here.
I'm in a very different state, and I'm thinking, wow, I never thought I'd be running into the Taj Mahal out here.
It's gorgeous.
I mean, how long did it take them to build that?
It's just -- So, uh, wooo.
And then we kind of have a cardinal rule that I'm never told, really, how far it is, because we don't know how far it is.
What's going to happen to you between this point and that point?
What's going to happen to the weather and the currents and, God forbid, you're stung when you don't think you could be stung in all this armor, and Bonnie made a decision coming into that third morning that I was suffering and I was hanging on by a thread and she said, "Come here," and I came close to the boat, and she said, "Look, look out there," and I saw light, because the day's easier than the night, and I thought we were coming into day, and I saw a stream of white light along the horizon, and I said, "It's going to be morning soon."
And she said, "No, those are the lights of Key West."
It was 15 more hours, which for most swimmers would be a long time.
You have no idea how many 15-hour training swims I had done.
So here we go, and I somehow, without a decision, went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting Stephen Hawking and the parameters of the universe, I just went into thinking about this dream, and why, and how.
And as I said, when I turned 60, it wasn't about that concrete "Can you do it?"
That's the everyday machinations.
That's the discipline, and it's the preparation, and there's a pride in that.
But I decided to think, as I went along, about, the phrase usually is reaching for the stars, and in my case, it's reaching for the horizon.
And when you reach for the horizon, as I've proven, you may not get there, but what a tremendous build of character and spirit that you lay down.
What a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons.
And now the shore is coming, and there's just a little part of me that's sad.
The epic journey is going to be over.
So many people come up to me now and say, "What's next? We love that!
That little tracker that was on the computer?
When are you going to do the next one? We just can't wait to follow the next one."
Well, they were just there for 53 hours, and I was there for years.
And so there won't be another epic journey in the ocean.
But the point is, and the point was that every day of our lives is epic, and I'll tell you, when I walked up onto that beach, staggered up onto that beach, and I had so many times in a very puffed up ego way, rehearsed what I would say on the beach.
When Bonnie thought that the back of my throat was swelling up, and she brought the medical team over to our boat to say that she's really beginning to have trouble breathing.
Another 12, 24 hours in the saltwater, the whole thing -- and I just thought in my hallucinatory moment, that I heard the word tracheotomy.
And Bonnie said to the doctor, "I'm not worried about her not breathing.
If she can't talk when she gets to the shore, she's gonna be pissed off."
But the truth is, all those orations that I had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation, it wasn't like that.
It was a very real moment, with that crowd, with my team.
We did it. I didn't do it. We did it.
And we'll never forget it. It'll always be part of us.
And the three things that I did sort of blurt out when we got there, was first, "Never, ever give up."
I live it. What's the phrase from today from Socrates?
To be is to do.
So I don't stand up and say, don't ever give up.
I didn't give up, and there was action behind these words.
The second is, "You can chase your dreams at any age; you're never too old."
Sixty-four, that no one at any age, any gender, could ever do, has done it, and there's no doubt in my mind that I am at the prime of my life today.
Yeah.
Thank you.
And the third thing I said on that beach was, "It looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world, and in many ways, of course, it is, and in other ways, and the most important ways, it's a team, and if you think I'm a badass, you want to meet Bonnie."
Bonnie, where are you?
Where are you?
There's Bonnie Stoll.
My buddy.
The Henry David Thoreau quote goes, when you achieve your dreams, it's not so much what you get as who you have become in achieving them.
And yeah, I stand before you now.
In the three months since that swim ended, I've sat down with Oprah and I've been in President Obama's Oval Office.
I've been invited to speak in front of esteemed groups such as yourselves.
I've signed a wonderful major book contract.
All of that's great, and I don't denigrate it.
I'm proud of it all, but the truth is, I'm walking around tall because I am that bold, fearless person, and I will be, every day, until it's time for these days to be done.
Thank you very much and enjoy the conference.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Find a way!

<title>Diana Nyad: Never, ever give up</title>
<description>In the pitch-black night, stung by jellyfish, choking on salt water, singing to herself, hallucinating … Diana Nyad just kept on swimming. And that's how she finally achieved her lifetime goal as an athlete: an extreme 100-mile swim from Cuba to Florida -- at age 64. Hear her story.</description>
<keywords>aging,culture,extreme sports</keywords>

One day in 1819, 3,000 miles off the coast of Chile, in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean, 20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater.
They'd been struck by a sperm whale, which had ripped a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.
As their ship began to sink beneath the swells, the men huddled together in three small whaleboats.
These men were 10,000 miles from home, more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.
In their small boats, they carried only rudimentary navigational equipment and limited supplies of food and water.
These were the men of the whaleship Essex, whose story would later inspire parts of "Moby Dick."
Even in today's world, their situation would be really dire, but think about how much worse it would have been then.
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.
No search party was coming to look for these men.
So most of us have never experienced a situation as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves, but we all know what it's like to be afraid.
We know how fear feels, but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about what our fears mean.
As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear as a weakness, just another childish thing to discard like baby teeth or roller skates.
And I think it's no accident that we think this way.
Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings are hard-wired to be optimists.
So maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes, as a danger in and of itself.
"Don't worry," we like to say to one another. "Don't panic."
In English, fear is something we conquer.
It's something we fight. It's something we overcome.
But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way?
What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination, something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself?
It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.
When I was a child, I lived in California, which is, you know, mostly a very nice place to live, but for me as a child, California could also be a little scary.
I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier that hung above our dining table swing back and forth during every minor earthquake, and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, terrified that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping.
And what we say about kids who have fears like that is that they have a vivid imagination.
But at a certain point, most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.
We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed, and not every earthquake brings buildings down.
But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults.
The same incredible imaginations that produced "The Origin of Species," "Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past," also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of Charles Darwin, Charlotte BrontĂŤ and Marcel Proust.
So the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear from visionaries and young children?
Well let's return to the year 1819 for a moment, to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex.
Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginations were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific.
Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship.
The time had come for the men to make a plan, but they had very few options.
In his fascinating account of the disaster, Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth.
The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the Marquesas Islands, 1,200 miles away.
But they'd heard some frightening rumors.
They'd been told that these islands, and several others nearby, were populated by cannibals.
So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner.
Another possible destination was Hawaii, but given the season, the captain was afraid they'd be struck by severe storms.
Now the last option was the longest, and the most difficult: to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of South America.
But they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water.
To be eaten by cannibals, to be battered by storms, to starve to death before reaching land.
These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men, and as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died.
Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.
What if instead of calling them fears, we called them stories?
Because that's really what fear is, if you think about it.
It's a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do.
And fears and storytelling have the same components.
They have the same architecture.
Like all stories, fears have characters.
In our fears, the characters are us.
Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.
You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails.
Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel.
Picture a cannibal, human teeth sinking into human skin, human flesh roasting over a fire.
Fears also have suspense.
If I've done my job as a storyteller today, you should be wondering what happened to the men of the whaleship Essex.
Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.
Just like all great stories, our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature: What will happen next?
In other words, our fears make us think about the future.
And humans, by the way, are the only creatures capable of thinking about the future in this way, of projecting ourselves forward in time, and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fears have in common with storytelling.
As a writer, I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction is learning to predict how one event in a story will affect all the other events, and fear works in that same way.
In fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another.
When I was writing my first novel, "The Age Of Miracles," I spent months trying to figure out what would happen if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.
What would happen to our days? What would happen to our crops?
What would happen to our minds?
And then it was only later that I realized how very similar these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night.
If an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry, what will happen to our house? What will happen to my family?
And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.
So if we think of our fears as more than just fears but as stories, we should think of ourselves as the authors of those stories.
But just as importantly, we need to think of ourselves as the readers of our fears, and how we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.
Now, some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others.
I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs, and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called "productive paranoia," which meant that these people, instead of dismissing their fears, these people read them closely, they studied them, and then they translated that fear into preparation and action.
So that way, if their worst fears came true, their businesses were ready.
And sometimes, of course, our worst fears do come true.
That's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear.
Once in a while, our fears can predict the future.
But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears that our imaginations concoct.
So how can we tell the difference between the fears worth listening to and all the others?
I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex offers an illuminating, if tragic, example.
After much deliberation, the men finally made a decision.
Terrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islands and instead embarked on the longer and much more difficult route to South America.
After more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food as they knew they might, and they were still quite far from land.
When the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive, and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.
Herman Melville, who used this story as research for "Moby Dick," wrote years later, and from dry land, quote, "All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex might in all human probability have been avoided had they, immediately after leaving the wreck, steered straight for Tahiti.
But," as Melville put it, "they dreaded cannibals."
So the question is, why did these men dread cannibals so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation?
Why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other?
Looked at from this angle, theirs becomes a story about reading.
The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader has a combination of two very different temperaments, the artistic and the scientific.
A good reader has an artist's passion, a willingness to get caught up in the story, but just as importantly, the readers also needs the coolness of judgment of a scientist, which acts to temper and complicate the reader's intuitive reactions to the story.
As we've seen, the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part.
They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios.
The problem was that they listened to the wrong story.
Of all the narratives their fears wrote, they responded only to the most lurid, the most vivid, the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture: cannibals.
But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears more like a scientist, with more coolness of judgment, they would have listened instead to the less violent but the more likely tale, the story of starvation, and headed for Tahiti, just as Melville's sad commentary suggests.
And maybe if we all tried to read our fears, we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them.
Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about serial killers and plane crashes, and more time concerned with the subtler and slower disasters we face: the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries, the gradual changes in our climate.
Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest, so too might our subtlest fears be the truest.
Read in the right way, our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance, a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there's still time to influence how that future will play out.
Properly read, our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature: a little wisdom, a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing -- the truth.
Thank you.

<title>Karen Thompson Walker: What fear can teach us</title>
<description>Imagine you're a shipwrecked sailor adrift in the enormous Pacific. You can choose one of three directions and save yourself and your shipmates -- but each choice comes with a fearful consequence too. How do you choose? In telling the story of the whaleship Essex, novelist Karen Thompson Walker shows how fear propels imagination, as it forces us to imagine the possible futures and how to cope with them.</description>

"People do stupid things.
That's what spreads HIV."
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper, The Guardian, not that long ago.
I'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it?
Well, one or two brave souls.
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of HIV for 15 years, worked on four continents, and you're looking at her.
And I am now going to argue that this is only half true.
People do get HIV because they do stupid things, but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons.
Now, "rational" is the dominant paradigm in public health, and if you put your public health nerd glasses on, you'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what's good for them and what's bad for them, if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information, and a little bit of motivation, people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives.
Wonderful.
That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV, and although I'm sure you all know that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality, and if you were at TED '07 it's about coffee prices ...
Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs, and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational, they are erections and addiction.
So, let's start with what's rational for an addict.
Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.
We were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.
It was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail, and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues.
And so everyone lined up, all the smackheads in a row, and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit, and he went down and started injecting people.
So he injects the first guy, and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt, and he injects the next guy.
And Frankie says, "I'm number 22 in line, and I can see the needle coming down towards me, and there is blood all over the place.
It's getting blunter and blunter.
And a small part of my brain is thinking, 'That is so gross and really dangerous,' but most of my brain is thinking, 'Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me.
Please let there be some left.'" And then, telling me this story, Frankie said, "You know ... God, drugs really make you stupid."
And, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy.
But, actually, Frankie, at that time, was a heroin addict and he was in jail.
So his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high.
And if there's one place you really want to get high, it's when you're in jail.
But I'm a scientist and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes, so let's look at some data.
We talked to 600 drug addicts in three cities in Indonesia, and we said, "Well, do you know how you get HIV?"
"Oh yeah, by sharing needles."
I mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles.
And, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that?"
"Oh yeah." Hundred percent.
"We're smackheads; we know where to get clean needles."
"So are you carrying a needle?"
We're actually interviewing people on the street, in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.
"Are you carrying clean needles?"
One in four, maximum.
So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10, and the other nine in 10 are sharing.
So you've got this massive mismatch; everyone knows that if they share they're going to get HIV, but they're all sharing anyway.
So what's that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something?
We asked that to a junkie and they're like, "Are you nuts?"
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.
There's just kind of an ick factor there.
"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail."
So, in Indonesia at this time, if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up, they could put you into jail.
And that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it?
Because your choice now is either I use my own needle now, or I could share a needle now and get a disease that's going to possibly kill me 10 years from now, or I could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow.
And while junkies think that it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV, they think it's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation and expose themselves to HIV anyway.
So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles.
Now, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view.
This is a really easy problem.
For once, your incentives are aligned.
We've got what's rational for public health.
You want people to use clean needles -- and junkies want to use clean needles.
So we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest.
Now, the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher.
And she put in the world's first national needle exchange program, and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.
And in all of those countries, you can see, not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV.
Now, places that didn't do this -- New York City for example, Moscow, Jakarta -- we're talking, at its peak, one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease.
Now, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this because she has any great love for junkies.
She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service.
So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention, she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on, and obviously those are much higher.
So she was making a politically rational decision.
Now, if I take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data, it seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?
But in this country, where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens, we've taken a very different approach.
So what we've been doing in the United States is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data.
So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States, and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them.
Now, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective -- you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up, but no -- that's the whole slide.
There is nothing on the other side.
So, completely irrational, you would think.
Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too, and they're responding to what they think the voters want.
So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this.
So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors.
Now let's talk about sex.
Are we any more rational about sex?
Well, I'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church, who think somehow that if you give out condoms, everyone's going to run out and have sex.
I don't know if Pope Benedict watches TEDTalks online, but if you do, I've got news for you Benedict -- I carry condoms all the time and I never get laid.
It's not that easy!
Here, maybe you'll have better luck.
Okay, seriously, HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually.
So, it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids.
And what we've got is a very, very high level of virus right at the beginning when you're first infected, then you start making antibodies, and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time -- 10 or 12 years -- you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.
But basically, nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic AIDS, and by that stage, you're not looking great, you're not feeling great, you're not having that much sex.
So the sexual transmission of HIV is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia.
Now, this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups, and that's considered stigmatizing.
I've always been a bit curious about that because I think stigma is a bad thing, whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing, but we'll leave that be.
The truth is that 20 years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time.
And those groups are, globally, people who sell sex and their more regular partners.
They are gay men on the party scene who have, on average, three times more partners than straight people on the party scene.
And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy, and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa.
These are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven, and one in three of all adults, are infected with HIV.
Now, in the rest of the world, we've got basically nothing going on in the general population -- very, very low levels -- but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk: drug injectors, sex workers and gay men.
And you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles: 25 percent prevalence among gay men.
Of course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person.
In most of the world, these few prevention failures notwithstanding, we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex: condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries.
And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.
What's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it's really bad for business to have another STI.
No one wants it.
And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.
So essentially, you're able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.
But in "intimate" relations it's much more difficult because, with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things, we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy, and nothing is quite so unromantic as the, "My condom or yours, darling?" question.
So in the face of that, you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms.
This, for example, this gentleman is called Joseph.
He's from Haiti and he has AIDS.
And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now, but he is a reminder in the population, of why you might want to be using condoms.
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.
Now, funnily enough, this is also Joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment.
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.
But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision-making.
So, what we've got -- some people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much because, actually, treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV."
So, if you look at the viremia thing again, if you do start treatment when you're sick, well, what happens? Your viral load comes down.
But compared to what? What happens if you're not on treatment?
Well, you die, so your viral load goes to zero.
And all of this green stuff here, including the spikes -- which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy, or you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs, or because you've started to get resistance, or whatever -- all of that is virus that wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.
Now, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy.
Let's just stop treating people."
Of course not, of course not.
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.
But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need.
That's simply not necessarily true, and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now.
And what we've seen is that, actually, condom use rates, which were very, very high -- the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV, with extremely little help from public health nerds, I would say -- that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really: One is the assumption of, "Oh well, if he's infected, he's probably on meds, and his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe."
And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS, and rightly so.
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you, and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day.
And that's boring, but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex, no matter how drunk you are, no matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?
If we look at the data, we can see that the answer to that question is, mmm.
So these are data from Scotland.
You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program.
Then it came way down.
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex -- and in drug users, you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins, and that's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier.
But in gay men, you've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available.
This is of new infections.
What does that mean?
It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population -- more people living longer, healthier lives, more likely to be getting laid with HIV -- is outweighing the effects of lower viral load, and that's a very worrisome thing.
What does it mean?
It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have.
Is that what's happening?
No, and I call it the "compassion conundrum."
We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days, and what's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers, unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.
But once they've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone to being AIDS victims, we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.
It doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view.
I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines.
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta; she's a chick with a dick.
Why does she do that job?
Well, of course, because she's forced into it because she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.
And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia: on average, 20 cents.
It varies a bit province to province.
I do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them for this particular slide, and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour.
So it's not a great job, but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice.
Okay, Ines.
We've got the tools, the knowledge and the cash, and commitment to preventing HIV too.
Ines: So why is prevalence still rising?
It's all politics.
When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.
Elizabeth Pisani: "When you get to politics, nothing makes sense."
So, from the point of view of a sex worker, politicians are making no sense.
From the point of view of a public health nerd, junkies are doing dumb things.
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale.
There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet, and that's one of the glories of human existence.
But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another, so it's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician, and it's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they're responding to what they think the voters want.
But here's the thing: we are the voters.
We're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders.
And everyone who's in this room, and everyone who's watching this out there on the web, I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense.
It's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what's rational for every Frankie and every Ines out there, but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV.
Thank you.

<title>Elizabeth Pisani: Sex, drugs and HIV -- let's get rational</title>
<description>Armed with bracing logic, wit and her "public-health nerd" glasses, Elizabeth Pisani reveals the myriad of inconsistencies in today's political systems that prevent our dollars from effectively fighting the spread of HIV. Her research with at-risk populations -- from junkies in prison to sex workers on the street in Cambodia -- demonstrates the sometimes counter-intuitive measures that could stall the spread of this devastating disease.</description>

I think it's safe to say that all humans will be intimate with death at least once in their lives.
But what if that intimacy began long before you faced your own transition from life into death?
What would life be like if the dead literally lived alongside you?
In my husband's homeland in the highlands of Sulawesi island in eastern Indonesia, there is a community of people that experience death not as a singular event but as a gradual social process.
In Tana Toraja, the most important social moments in people's lives, the focal points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners, but funerals.
So these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals -- pigs, chickens and, most importantly, water buffalo -- that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased.
So this cultural complex surrounding death, the ritual enactment of the end of life, has made death the most visible and remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape.
Lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair, where commemorating someone who's died is not so much a private sadness but more of a publicly shared transition.
And it's a transition that's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead.
So every year, thousands of visitors come to Tana Toraja to see, as it were, this culture of death, and for many people these grandiose ceremonies and the length of the ceremonies are somehow incommensurable with the way that we face our own mortality in the West.
So even as we share death as a universal experience, it's not experienced the same way the world over.
And as an anthropologist, I see these differences in experience being rooted in the cultural and social world through which we define the phenomena around us.
So where we see an unquestionable reality, death as an irrefutable biological condition, Torajans see the expired corporeal form as part of a larger social genesis.
So again, the physical cessation of life is not the same as death.
In fact, a member of society is only truly dead when the extended family can agree upon and marshal the resources necessary to hold a funeral ceremony that is considered appropriate in terms of resources for the status of the deceased.
And this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone's participation.
So after a person's physical death, their body is placed in a special room in the traditional residence, which is called the tongkonan.
And the tongkonan is symbolic not only of the family's identity but also of the human life cycle from birth to death.
So essentially, the shape of the building that you're born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place.
Until the funeral ceremony, which can be held years after a person's physical death, the deceased is referred to as "to makala," a sick person, or "to mama," a person who is asleep, and they continue to be a member of the household.
They are symbolically fed and cared for, and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions, which communicates to the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life into the afterlife known as Puya.
So I know what some of you must be thinking right now.
Is she really saying that these people live with the bodies of their dead relatives?
And that's exactly what I'm saying.
But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction we have to this idea of proximity to bodies, proximity to death, or how this notion just does not fit into our very biological or medical sort of definition of death, I like to think about what the Torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out.
I think that Torajans socially recognize and culturally express what many of us feel to be true despite the widespread acceptance of the biomedical definition of death, and that is that our relationships with other humans, their impact on our social reality, doesn't cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body, that there's a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed but not ended.
So Torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship by lavishing love and attention on the most visible symbol of that relationship, the human body.
So my husband has fond memories of talking to and playing with and generally being around his deceased grandfather, and for him there is nothing unnatural about this.
This is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition in their relationship to the deceased, and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who's living to relating to the deceased as a person who's an ancestor.
And here you can see these wooden effigies of the ancestors, so these are people who have already been buried, already had a funeral ceremony.
These are called tau tau.
So the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death.
It ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities.
And it's also a moment of self-awareness.
It's a moment when people think about who they are, their place in society, and their role in the life cycle in accordance with Torajan cosmology.
There's a saying in Toraja that all people will become grandparents, and what this means is that after death, we all become part of the ancestral line that anchors us between the past and the present and will define who our loved ones are into the future.
So essentially, we all become grandparents to the generations of human children that come after us.
And this metaphor of membership in the greater human family is the way that children also describe the money that they invest in these sacrificial buffaloes that are thought to carry people's soul from here to the afterlife, and children will explain that they will invest the money in this because they want to repay their parents the debt for all of the years their parents spent investing and caring for them.
But the sacrifice of buffalo and the ritual display of wealth also exhibits the status of the deceased, and, by extension, the deceased's family.
So at funerals, relationships are reconfirmed but also transformed in a ritual drama that highlights the most salient feature about death in this place: its impact on life and the relationships of the living.
So all of this focus on death doesn't mean that Torajans don't aspire to the ideal of a long life.
They engage in many practices thought to confer good health and survival to an advanced age.
But they don't put much stock in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness or in old age.
It's said in Toraja that everybody has sort of a predetermined amount of life.
It's called the sunga'.
And like a thread, it should be allowed to unspool to its natural end.
So by having death as a part of the cultural and social fabric of life, people's everyday decisions about their health and healthcare are affected.
The patriarch of my husband's maternal clan, Nenet Katcha, is now approaching the age of 100, as far as we can tell.
And there are increasing signs that he is about to depart on his own journey for Puya.
And his death will be greatly mourned.
But I know that my husband's family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives, when they can ritually recount his life's narrative, weaving his story into the history of their community.
His story is their story.
His funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves.
And it's a story that has no discernible beginning, no foreseeable end.
It's a story that goes on long after his body no longer does.
People ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed by participating in a culture where the physical manifestations of death greet us at every turn.
But I see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one.
In reality, the relationship between the living and the dead has its own drama in the U.S. healthcare system, where decisions about how long to stretch the thread of life are made based on our emotional and social ties with the people around us, not just on medicine's ability to prolong life.
We, like the Torajans, base our decisions about life on the meanings and the definitions that we ascribe to death.
So I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience should run out and adopt the traditions of the Torajans.
It might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the United States.
But I want to ask what we can gain from seeing physical death not only as a biological process but as part of the greater human story.
What would it be like to look on the expired human form with love because it's so intimately a part of who we all are?
If we could expand our definition of death to encompass life, we could experience death as part of life and perhaps face death with something other than fear.
Perhaps one of the answers to the challenges that are facing the U.S. healthcare system, particularly in the end-of-life care, is as simple as a shift in perspective, and the shift in perspective in this case would be to look at the social life of every death.
It might help us recognize that the way we limit our conversation about death to something that's medical or biological is reflective of a larger culture that we all share of avoiding death, being afraid of talking about it.
If we could entertain and value other kinds of knowledge about life, including other definitions of death, it has the potential to change the discussions that we have about the end of life.
It could change the way that we die, but more importantly, it could transform the way that we live.

<title>Kelli Swazey: Life that doesn't end with death</title>
<description>In Tana Toraja, weddings and births aren't the social gatherings that knit society together. In this part of Indonesia, big, raucous funerals form the center of social life. Anthropologist Kelli Swazey takes a look at this culture, in which the bodies of dead relatives are cared for even years after they have passed. While it sounds strange to Western sensibilities, she says, this could actually be a truer reflection of the fact that relationships with loved ones don't simply end when breathing does. </description>

Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space, architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses.
Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes.
It's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass.
From urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff.
The thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space.
And these are everyday conventions, conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.
And I've assembled a sampling of work that all share a kind of productive nihilism that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect.
And that is something like nothing, or something next to nothing.
It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through.
This is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002 on Lake Neuchatel, near Geneva.
And we wanted to use the water not only as a context, but as a primary building material.
We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere.
So, no walls, no roof, no purpose -- just a mass of atomized water, a big cloud.
And this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions, which feeds, or has been feeding, our insatiable appetite for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity.
High definition, in our opinion, has become the new orthodoxy.
And we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology, to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition, that also challenges the conventions of space and skin, and rethinks our dependence on vision?
So this is how we sought to do it.
Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles, 35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure.
It reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, dew point, and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout.
And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather.
So, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure.
It's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field, and it sits on just four very delicate columns.
These are the fog nozzles, the interface, and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather, and producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather.
So, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why.
Now, here we go, one side, the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was.
Unlike entering any normal space, entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.
It's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless, purposeless and dimensionless.
All references are erased, leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles.
So, this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do.
And we pride ourselves -- it's a spectacular anti-spectacle in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head.
So, the audience is dispersed, focused attention and dramatic build-up and climax are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention that's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog.
And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way.
So here the world is put out of focus, while our visual dependence is put into focus.
The public, you know, once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar.
So, all the waters of the world are served there, so we thought that, you know, after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water, you could also drink this building.
And so it is sort of a theme, but it goes a little bit, you know, deeper than that.
We really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense, and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses.
You know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell, because the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know, 10 million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate?"
And, you know, we thought -- well, we tried to convince them.
And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know, it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.
Anyway, it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed, and so it's now a memory of an apparition, actually, but it continues to live in edible form.
And this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar.
Anyway, moving along.
So in the '80s and '90s, we were mostly known for independent work, such as installation artist, architect, commissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations.
And we did a lot of media work, also a lot of experimental theater projects.
In 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s.
However, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective, and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show.
This was a piece on tourism in the United States.
This is "Soft Sell" for 42nd Street.
This was something done at the Cartier Foundation.
"Master/Slave" at the MOMA, the project series, a piece called "Parasite."
And so there were many, many of these kinds of projects.
Anyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know, the problem of the retrospective was something we were very uncomfortable with.
It's a kind of invention of the museum that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work.
And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all.
And one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself, and asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall.
So, what you see here is basically a plan of many installations that were put there.
And we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces, which didn't belong together.
But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time.
We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation.
And what you see is -- actually, the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element, which was a new piece that created -- that we created for the -- which was a robotic drill, basically, that went all the way around, cruised the museum, went all around the walls and did a lot of damage.
So, the drill was mounted on this robotic arm.
We worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain.
Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller, and it was really very much fun to work with them.
They weren't doing their primary work, which was for the government, while they were helping us with this.
In any case, the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls.
So, unfolded it's about 300 linear feet.
And it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix.
It selects a point, it guides the drill to that point, it pierces the dry wall, leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location.
Initially these holes were lone blemishes, and as the exhibition continued the walls became increasingly perforated.
So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned, opening views from gallery to gallery.
Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall.
And so this was a three-month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element.
And also the acoustic separation was destroyed.
Also the visual separation.
And there was also this constant background groan, which was very annoying.
And this is one of the blackout spaces where there's a video piece that became totally not useful.
So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display, the wall now actively competed for attention.
And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective.
It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text.
Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago.
It's the ICA -- the Institute of Contemporary Art -- in Boston, which is on the waterfront.
And there's not enough time to really introduce the building, but I'll simply say that the building negotiates between this outwardly focused nature of the site -- you know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston -- and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum.
So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking -- I mean that's its primary objective, both its program and its architectural conceit.
The building incorporates the site, but it dispenses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is choreographed.
So, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater, by the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space where the view is turned off.
Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall.
This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment.
And then, this is a view going up, and then you could come into the theater, which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop.
And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open.
The view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light, and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view.
The original intention of this space, which was unfortunately never realized, was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out.
In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a climax, but to have the view stalk you, so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other.
This was eliminated because the view was too good, and the mayor said, "No, we just want this open."
The architect lost here.
But culminating -- and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk -- is this Mediatheque, which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building.
So this is an 80-foot cantilever -- it's quite substantial.
So, it's already sticking out into space enough, and then from that is this, is this small area called the Mediatheque.
The Mediatheque has something like 16 stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web.
And this was really a kind of very important part of this building, and here is a point where architecture -- this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device, it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling, to only expose the water itself, the texture of water, much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that.
And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project.
But there is just no information, it's just -- it's just hypnosis.
Moving along to Lincoln Center.
These are the guys that did the project in the first place, 50 years ago.
We're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions.
But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone.
This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010.
And for the purposes of this talk, I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects, and it happens to be our current obsession, and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction.
It's Alice Tully Hall, and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building and descends several levels under the street.
So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be, before the renovation, which we just started.
And we asked ourselves, why couldn't it be exhibitionistic, like the Met, or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center?
And one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity, expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible.
And this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped.
We basically did a striptease, architectural striptease, where we're framing with this kind of canopy -- the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard, about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway, and then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall.
Before and after shot.
Wait a minute, it's just in that state, we have a long way to go.
But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left to just talk about the hall itself, which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work.
So, the hall is a multi-purpose hall.
The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall.
Now, that's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats.
Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small-scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy.
How do you bring an intimacy into a hall?
Intimacy for us means a lot of different things.
It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy.
One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall.
Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall.
It's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound, like a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles.
The walls are made of absorptive surface, half absorptive, half reflective, which is not very good for concert sound.
This is Avery Fisher Hall, but the notion of junk -- visual junk -- was very, very important to us, to get rid of visual noise.
Because we can't eliminate a single seat, the architecture is restricted to 18 inches.
So it's a very, very thin architecture.
First we do a kind of partial box and box separation, to take away the distraction of the subway noise.
Next we wrap the entire hall -- almost like this Olivetti keyboard -- with a material, with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces: wall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes.
But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf.
Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage.
Just everything is lined, it incorporates -- every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high-performance skin.
But one more added feature.
So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction, everything that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house, the audience, with the performers, we add one little detail, one piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting.
We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts.
So what we wanted to do was produce this effect, this lighting effect, which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls.
And what it entails is the use of resin, of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall, in a kind of seamless continuity that wraps the hall in light, like a belt of light: rather than separating, like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers, it connects audience with players.
And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale.
And this is a guy from Salt Lake City, this is what they look like out there.
And for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing, but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin, very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier, the walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage.
And this is Tully in construction now.
I have no ending to say, except that I'm a couple of minutes over.
Thank you very much.

Like most journalists, I'm an idealist.
I love unearthing good stories, especially untold stories.
I just didn't think that, in 2011, women would still be in that category.
I'm the President of the Journalism &amp; Women Symposium, JAWS. That's Sharky.
I joined 10 years ago because I wanted female role models, and I was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession, and what that meant for our image in the media.
We make up half the population of the world, but we're just 24 percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories, and we're just 20 percent of the experts quoted in stories, and now, with today's technology, it's possible to remove women from the picture completely.
This is a picture of President Barack Obama and his advisors tracking the killing of Osama bin Laden.
You can see Hillary Clinton on the right.
Let's see how the photo ran in an Orthodox Jewish newspaper based in Brooklyn.
Hillary's completely gone.
The paper apologized but said it never runs photos of women.
They might be sexually provocative.
This is an extreme case, yes, but the fact is, women are only 19 percent of the sources in stories on politics, and only 20 percent in stories on the economy.
The news continues to give us a picture where men outnumber women in nearly all occupational categories except two: students and homemakers.
So we all get a very distorted picture of reality.
The problem is, of course, there aren't enough women in newsrooms.
They reported just 37 percent of stories in print, TV and radio.
Even in stories on gender-based violence, men get an overwhelming majority of print space and airtime.
Case in point, this March, the New York Times ran a story by James McKinley about a gang rape of a young girl, 11 years old, in a small Texas town.
McKinley writes that the community's wondering, "How could their boys have been drawn into this?"
"Drawn into this," like they were seduced into committing an act of violence.
And the first person he quotes says, "These boys will have to live with this the rest of their lives."
You don't hear much about the 11-year-old victim, except that she wore clothes that were a little old for her and she wore makeup.
The Times was deluged with criticism.
Initially, it defended itself, and said, "These aren't our views.
This is what we found in our reporting."
Now, here's a secret you probably know already: Your stories are constructed.
As reporters, we research, we interview.
We try to give a good picture of reality.
We also have our own unconscious biases, but the Times makes it sound like anyone would have reported this story the same way.
I disagree with that.
So three weeks later, the Times revisits the story.
This time, it adds another byline to it with McKinley's: Erica Goode.
What emerges is a truly sad, horrific tale of a young girl and her family trapped in poverty.
She was raped numerous times by many men.
She had been a bright, easygoing girl.
She was maturing quickly, physically, but her bed was still covered with stuffed animals.
It's a very different picture.
Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goode is what made this story more complete.
The Global Media Monitoring Project has found that stories by female reporters are more likely to challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters.
At KUNM here in Albuquerque, Elaine Baumgartel did some graduate research on the coverage of violence against women.
What she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims and devalue their lives.
They tend to sensationalize, and they lack context.
So for her graduate work, she did a three-part series on the murder of 11 women found buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa.
She tried to challenge those patterns and stereotypes in her work, and she tried to show the challenges that journalists face, from external sources, their own internal biases, and cultural norms, and she worked with an editor at National Public Radio to try to get a story aired nationally.
She's not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female.
Stories in the news are more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men, and women are more likely to be defined by their body parts.
Wired magazine, November 2010.
Yes, the issue was about breast tissue engineering.
Now, I know you're all distracted, so I'll take that off.
Eyes up here.
So -- Here's the thing.
Wired almost never puts women on its cover.
Oh, there have been some gimmicky ones.
Pam from The Office.
Manga girls.
A voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds.
Texas State University professor Cindy Royal wondered in her blog, "How are young women like her students supposed to feel about their roles in technology reading Wired?"
Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired, defended his choice and said, there aren't enough women, prominent women in technology to sell a cover, to sell an issue.
Part of that is true. There aren't as many prominent women in technology.
Here's my problem with that argument.
Media tells us every day what's important, by the stories they choose and where they place them.
It's called agenda-setting.
How many people knew the founders of Facebook and Google before their faces were on a magazine cover?
Putting them there made them more recognizable.
Now, Fast Company Magazine embraces that idea.
This is its cover from November 15, 2010.
The issue is about the most prominent and influential women in technology.
Editor Robert Safian told the Poynter Institute, "Silicon Valley is very white and very male, but that's not what Fast Company thinks the business world will look like in the future, so it tries to give a picture of where the globalized world is moving."
By the way, apparently Wired took all this to heart.
This was its issue in April.
That's Limor Fried, the founder of Adafruit Industries, in the Rosie the Riveter pose.
It would help to have more women in positions of leadership in the media. A recent global survey found that 73 percent of the top media management jobs are still held by men.
But this is also about something far more complex: our own unconscious biases and blind spots.
Shankar Vedantam is the author of "The Hidden Brain: How Our Unconscious Minds Elect Presidents, Control Markets, Wage Wars, and Save Our Lives."
He told the former ombudsman at National Public Radio, who was doing a report on how women fare in NPR coverage, unconscious bias flows throughout most of our lives.
It's really difficult to disentangle those strands.
But he did have one suggestion.
He used to work for two editors who said every story had to have at least one female source.
He balked, at first, but said he eventually followed the directive happily because his stories got better and his job got easier.
Now, I don't know if one of the editors was a woman, but that can make the biggest differences.
The Dallas Morning News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994 for a series it did on women around the world, but one of the reporters told me she's convinced it never would have happened if they had not had a female assistant foreign editor, and they would not have gotten some of those stories without female reporters and editors on the ground, particularly one on female genital mutilation.
Men would just not be allowed into those situations.
This is an important point to consider, because much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries where the treatment of women is an issue, such as Afghanistan.
What we're told in terms of arguments against leaving this country is that the fate of the women is primary.
Now I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul can find women to interview. Not so sure about rural, traditional areas, where I'm guessing women can't talk to strange men.
It's important to keep talking about this in light of Lara Logan.
She was the CBS News correspondent who was brutally sexually assaulted in Egypt's Tahrir Square right after this photo was taken.
Almost immediately, pundits weighed in blaming her and saying things like, "You know, maybe women shouldn't be sent to cover those stories."
I never heard anyone say this about Anderson Cooper and his crew who were attacked covering the same story.
One way to get more women into leadership is to have other women mentor them.
One of my board members is an editor at a major global media company, but she never thought about this as a career path until she met female role models at JAWS.
But this is not just a job for super-journalists, or my organization. You all have a stake in a strong, vibrant media.
Analyze your news, and speak up when there are gaps missing in coverage like people at the New York Times did.
Suggest female sources to reporters and editors.
Remember, a complete picture of reality may depend upon it.
And I'll leave you with a video clip that I first saw in 2007 when I was a student in London.
It's for the Guardian newspaper.
It's actually long before I ever thought about becoming a journalist, but I was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world.
An event seen from one point of view gives one impression.
Seen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression.
But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what's going on.
"The Guardian" Megan Kamerick: I think you'll all agree that we'd be better off if we all had the whole picture.

Pat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin?
Madeleine Albright: This is "Breaking the Glass Ceiling."
PM: Oh.
That was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen.
M Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen.
And none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein.
I'll tell you what happened.
I went to the United Nations as an ambassador, and it was after the Gulf War, and I was an instructed ambassador.
And the cease-fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions, and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly, which he deserved -- he had invaded another country.
And so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad comparing me to many things, but among them an "unparalleled serpent."
And so I happened to have a snake pin.
So I wore it when we talked about Iraq.
And when I went out to meet the press, they zeroed in, said, "Why are you wearing that snake pin?"
I said, "Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent."
And then I thought, well this is fun.
So I went out and I bought a lot of pins that would, in fact, reflect what I thought we were going to do on any given day.
So that's how it all started.
PM: So how large is the collection?
M Pretty big.
It's now traveling.
At the moment it's in Indianapolis, but it was at the Smithsonian.
And it goes with a book that says, "Read My Pins."
PM: So is this a good idea.
I remember when you were the first woman as Secretary of State, and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing, how you looked -- the thing that happens to a lot of women, especially if they're the first in a position.
So how do you feel about that -- the whole -- M Well, it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing.
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had.
What was interesting was that, before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador, I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me, and she said, "You've got to get rid of your professor clothes.
Go out and look like a diplomat."
So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping.
But still, there were all kinds of questions about -- "did you wear a hat?" "How short was your skirt?"
And one of the things -- if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots, and she got criticized over that.
And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it.
PM: It is, for all of us, men and women, finding our ways of defining our roles, and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future.
How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ...
and so how did you handle that?
M Well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State a few minutes after I'd been named.
And I said, "Well I've been a woman for 60 years, but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes."
So it evolved.
But basically I love being a woman.
And so what happened -- and I think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this -- I went to my first meeting, first at the U.N., and that's when this all started, because that is a very male organization.
And I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council -- so 14 men sat there staring at me, and I thought -- well you know how we all are.
You want to get the feeling of the room, and "do people like me?"
and "will I really say something intelligent?"
And all of a sudden I thought, "Well, wait a minute.
I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,' and if I don't speak today then the voice of the United States will not be heard," and it was the first time that I had that feeling that I had to step out of myself in my normal, reluctant female mode and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country.
And so that happened more at various times, but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman.
I think we are a lot better at personal relationships, and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it's necessary.
But I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter, when she turned seven last year, said to her mother, my daughter, "So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State?
Only girls are Secretary of State."
PM: Because in her lifetime -- M That would be so.
As you travel now all over the world, which you do frequently, how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls?
Where are we?
M I think we're slowly changing, but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different.
And therefore it means that we have to remember that, while many of us have had huge opportunities -- and Pat, you have been a real leader in your field -- is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women.
And so what I have felt -- and I have looked at this from a national security issue -- when I was Secretary of State, I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy, not just because I'm a feminist, but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered, that values are passed down, the health situation is better, education is better, there is greater economic prosperity.
So I think that it behooves us -- those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice -- that we need to help other women.
And I really dedicated myself to that, both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State.
PM: And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy?
M From some people.
I think that they thought that it was a soft issue.
The bottom line that I decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues, because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects, and because, as I said, it is really central to the way that we think about things.
Now for instance, some of the wars that took place when I was in office, a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.
For instance, when I started, there were wars in the Balkans.
The women in Bosnia were being raped.
We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically with those kinds of issues.
And by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage was, I had just arrived at the U.N., and when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N.
Now there are 192.
But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself.
So I said to my assistant, "Invite the other women permanent representatives."
And I thought when I'd get to my apartment that there'd be a lot of women there.
I get there, and there are six other women, out of 183.
So the countries that had women representatives were Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines, Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica, Lichtenstein and me.
So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.
And so we set it up, and we called ourselves the G7.
PM: Is that "Girl 7?" M Girl 7.
And we lobbied on behalf of women's issues.
So we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal.
And then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war, that it was against humanity.
PM: So when you look around the world and you see that, in many cases -- certainly in the Western world -- women are evolving into more leadership positions, and even other places some barriers are being brought down, but there's still so much violence, still so many problems, and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables.
Now you were at those negotiating tables when they weren't, when there was maybe you -- one voice, maybe one or two others.
Do you believe, and can you tell us why, there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis?
M Well I do think, when there are more women, that the tone of the conversation changes, and also the goals of the conversation change.
But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women.
If you think that, you've forgotten high school.
But the bottom line is that there is a way, when there are more women at the table, that there's an attempt to develop some understanding.
So for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi, we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in Rwanda.
And so I think the capability of women to put themselves -- I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes and having more empathy.
I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room.
When I was Secretary of State, there were only 13 other women foreign ministers.
And so it was nice when one of them would show up.
For instance, she is now the president of Finland, but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland and, at a certain stage, head of the European Union.
And it was really terrific.
Because one of the things I think you'll understand.
We went to a meeting, and the men in my delegation, when I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this," and they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?"
And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me.
And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control, and she said, "Well I feel we should do this."
And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden.
But I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions.
The other thing that I think is really important: A lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy, but it's about budgets, military budgets, and how the debts of countries work out.
So if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts, they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.
PM: So how do we get this balance we're looking for, then, in the world?
More women's voices at the table?
More men who believe that the balance is best?
M Well I think one of the things -- I'm chairman of the board of an organization called the National Democratic Institute that works to support women candidates.
I think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office, to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices.
I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other.
Now I have a saying that I feel very strongly about, because I am of a certain age where, when I started in my career, believe it or not, there were other women who criticized me: "Why aren't you in the carpool line?"
or "Aren't your children suffering because you're not there all the time?"
And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty.
In fact, I think "guilt" is every woman's middle name.
And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other.
And my motto is that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other.
PM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.
Thank you for joining us today.
M Thank you all. Thanks Pat.

Interestingly, Charles Darwin was born a very lightly pigmented man, in a moderately-to-darkly pigmented world.
Over the course of his life, Darwin had great privilege.
He lived in a fairly wealthy home.
He was raised by very supportive and interested parents.
And when he was in his 20s he embarked upon a remarkable voyage on the ship the Beagle.
And during the course of that voyage, he saw remarkable things: tremendous diversity of plants and animals, and humans.
And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book, "On the Origin of Species," published 150 years ago.
Now what is so interesting and to some, the extent, what's a bit infamous about "The Origin of Species," is that there is only one line in it about human evolution.
"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."
It wasn't until much longer, much later, that Darwin actually spoke and wrote about humans.
Now in his years of traveling on the Beagle, and from listening to the accounts or explorers and naturalists, he knew that skin color was one of the most important ways in which people varied.
And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color.
He knew that darkly pigmented peoples were found close to the equator; lightly pigmented peoples, like himself, were found closer to the poles.
So what did he make of all this?
Well he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species.
But much later, in 1871, he did have something to say about it.
And it was quite curious. He said, "Of all the differences between the races of men, the color of the skin is the most conspicuous and one of the best marked."
And he went on to say, "These differences do not coincide with corresponding differences in climate."
So he had traveled all around.
He had seen people of different colors living in different places.
And yet he rejected the idea that human skin pigmentation was related to the climate.
If only Darwin lived today.
If only Darwin had NASA.
Now, one of the wonderful things that NASA does is it puts up a variety of satellites that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment.
And for many decades now there have been a series of TOMS satellites that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface.
The TOMS 7 satellite data, shown here, show the annual average ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface.
Now the really hot pink and red areas are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts of UV during the year.
The incrementally cooler colors -- blues, greens, yellows, and finally grays -- indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation.
What's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere is in these cool gray zones.
This has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation.
And what Darwin could not appreciate, or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time, is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation.
And that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution.
And so when we look at a map of skin color, and predicted skin color, as we know it today, what we see is a beautiful gradient from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator, and the lightest ones toward the poles.
What's very, very important here is that the earliest humans evolved in high-UV environments, in equatorial Africa.
The earliest members of our lineage, the genus Homo, were darkly pigmented.
And we all share this incredible heritage of having originally been darkly pigmented, two million to one and half million years ago.
Now what happened in our history?
Let's first look at the relationship of ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface.
In those early days of our evolution, looking at the equator, we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation.
The UVC, the most energetic type, was occluded by the Earth's atmosphere.
But UVB and UVA especially, came in unimpeded.
UVB turns out to be incredibly important.
It's very destructive, but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin, vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones, the health of our immune system, and myriad other important functions in our bodies.
So, living at the equator, we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin -- this wonderful, complex, ancient polymer compound in our skin -- served as a superb natural sunscreen.
This polymer is amazing because it's present in so many different organisms.
Melanin, in various forms, has probably been on the Earth a billion years, and has been recruited over and over again by evolution, as often happens.
Why change it if it works?
So melanin was recruited, in our lineage, and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in Africa, to be a natural sunscreen.
Where it protected the body against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation, the destruction, or damage to DNA, and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate, which helps to fuel cell production, and reproduction in the body.
So, it's wonderful. We evolved this very protective, wonderful covering of melanin.
But then we moved.
And humans dispersed -- not once, but twice.
Major moves, outside of our equatorial homeland, from Africa into other parts of the Old World, and most recently, into the New World.
When humans dispersed into these latitudes, what did they face?
Conditions were significantly colder, but they were also less intense with respect to the ultraviolet regime.
So if we're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, look at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation.
We're still getting a dose of UVA.
But all of the UVB, or nearly all of it, is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere.
In the winter, when you are skiing in the Alps, you may experience ultraviolet radiation.
But it's all UVA, and, significantly, that UVA has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin.
So people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments were bereft of the potential to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year.
This had tremendous consequences for the evolution of human skin pigmentation.
Because what happened, in order to ensure health and well-being, these lineages of people dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere lost their pigmentation.
There was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin.
Here we begin to see the evolution of the beautiful sepia rainbow that now characterizes all of humanity.
Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once, not just twice, but probably three times.
Not just in modern humans, but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors, the Neanderthals.
A remarkable, remarkable testament to the power of evolution.
Humans have been on the move for a long time.
And just in the last 5,000 years, in increasing rates, over increasing distances.
Here are just some of the biggest movements of people, voluntary movements, in the last 5,000 years.
Look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions: people from high UV areas going to low UV and vice versa.
And not all these moves were voluntary.
Between 1520 and 1867, 12 million, 500 people were moved from high UV to low UV areas in the transatlantic slave trade.
Now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences.
But it also had deleterious health consequences to people.
So what? We've been on the move.
We're so clever we can overcome all of these seeming biological impediments.
Well, often we're unaware of the fact that we're living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly adapted.
Some of us with lightly pigmented skin live in high-UV areas.
Some of us with darkly pigmented skin live in low-UV areas.
These have tremendous consequences for our health.
We have to, if we're lightly pigmented, be careful about the problems of skin cancer, and destruction of folate in our bodies, by lots of sun.
Epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin.
What they haven't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas, or working inside all the time.
Because the problem there is just as severe, but it is more sinister, because vitamin D deficiency, from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation, is a major problem.
Vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people, and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones, to their gradual decay of their immune systems, or loss of immune function, and probably some problems with their mood and health, their mental health.
So we have, in skin pigmentation, one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today.
And the social consequences, as we know, are incredibly profound.
We live in a world where we have lightly and darkly pigmented people living next to one another, but often brought into proximity initially as a result of very invidious social interactions.
So how can we overcome this?
How can we begin to understand it?
Evolution helps us.
200 years after Darwin's birthday, we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States.
How wonderful is that?
This man is significant for a whole host of reasons.
But we need to think about how he compares, in terms of his pigmentation, to other people on Earth.
He, as one of many urban admixed populations, is very emblematic of a mixed parentage, of a mixed pigmentation.
And he resembles, very closely, people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in southern Africa, or Southeast Asia.
These people have a tremendous potential to tan, to develop more pigment in their skin, as a result of exposure to sun.
They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency, if they have desk jobs, like that guy.
So lets all wish for his great health, and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation.
Now what is wonderful about the evolution of human skin pigmentation, and the phenomenon of pigmentation, is that it is the demonstration, the evidence, of evolution by natural selection, right on your body.
When people ask you, "What is the evidence for evolution?"
You don't have to think about some exotic examples, or fossils.
You just have to look at your skin.
Darwin, I think, would have appreciated this, even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life.
I think, were he able to look at the evidence we have today, he would understand it.
He would appreciate it.
And most of all, he would teach it.
You, you can teach it.
You can touch it.
You can understand it.
Take it out of this room.
Take your skin color, and celebrate it.
Spread the word.
You have the evolution of the history of our species, part of it, written in your skin.
Understand it. Appreciate it. Celebrate it.
Go out. Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it wonderful?
You are the products of evolution.
Thank you.

<title>Nina Jablonski: Skin color is an illusion</title>
<description>Nina Jablonski says that differing skin colors are simply our bodies' adaptation to varied climates and levels of UV exposure. Charles Darwin disagreed with this theory, but she explains, that's because he did not have access to NASA.</description>

You know, there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains, far from these beautiful mountains, where the people of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different, which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product.
And why not?
After all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few, but a fundamental human right for all.
And what is happiness?
Happiness is the freedom of choice.
The freedom to chose where to live, what to do, what to buy, what to sell, from whom, to whom, when and how.
Where does choice come from?
And who gets to express it, and how do we express it?
Well, one way to express choice is through the market.
Well-functioning markets provide choices, and ultimately, the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness.
The great Indian economist, Amartya Sen, was awarded the Nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply, but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market.
In 1984, in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity, nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth, Ethiopia.
Not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north, people could not access or entitle themselves to that food.
That was a turning point for my life.
Most Africans today, by far, are farmers.
And most of Africa's farmers are, by and large, small farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal.
African agriculture today is among, or is, the most under-capitalized in the world.
Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated, compared to 40 percent in Asia.
African farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare, compared to 144 in Asia.
Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa.
There are eight times more tractors in Latin America, and three times more tractors in Asia, than in Africa.
The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice, and therefore without much freedom.
His livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty.
He comes to the market when prices are lowest, with the meager fruits of his hard labor, just after the harvest, because he has no choice.
She comes back to the market some months later, when prices are highest, in what we call the lean season -- when food is scarce -- because she has to feed her family and has no choice.
The real question is, how can markets be developed in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists?
Another notable economist, Theodore Schultz, in 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient, but poor.
Meaning, in fact, that farmers are rational and profit-minded just like everybody else.
Well, we don't need, now, any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money, just like everyone else.
And one thing is clear, which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business.
And that business is agriculture.
Over two decades ago, the world insisted to Africa that markets must be liberalized, that economies must be structurally adjusted.
This meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling -- which they did rather inefficiently -- and let the private market do its magic.
Well, what happened over the last 25 years?
Did Africa feed itself?
Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors?
I think we're all in this room, probably, because we know that, in fact, Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next 10 years, where the food import bill is now double what it was 20 years ago, where food production per capita has stagnated, and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased.
So why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations?
The market reforms prompted by the West -- and I've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets, and have interviewed traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent, hundreds of traders -- trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform.
And it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water.
Like its agriculture, Africa's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient.
We know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market, and the risks of transacting in rural, agriculture markets, are extremely high.
In fact, only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market.
Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications, but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions, such as market information, grades and standards, and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers.
Because of this, commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles, in narrow networks of people they know and trust.
And because of that, as grain changes hands -- and I've measured that it changes hands four, five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer -- every time it changes hands -- and I've seen this all over rural Africa -- it also changes sacks.
And I thought that was incredibly peculiar.
And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me over and over -- that's the only way people know what they're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality.
And that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals, and situations where there are deficits, for example.
It also has very high cost implications.
I have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that, because of the absence of grades and standards and market information, sacks have to be constantly changed.
And this leads to very high handling costs.
For their part, small farmers, who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa, come to the market with virtually no information at all -- blind -- trusting that they're going to have some sort of demand for their produce, and completely at the mercy of the merchants in the only market, the nearest local market they know -- where they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk.
Speaking of risk, we have seen that price volatility of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world.
In Africa, small farmers bear the brunt of this risk.
In fact, in my view, there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africa's farmers have to bear.
And in my view, there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in Africa today face.
In Ethiopia, for example, the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually.
This kind of market risk is mind-boggling, and has direct implications for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology, such as modern seeds and fertilizers, but also direct implications for food security.
To give you an example, between 2001 and 2002, Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest.
That in turn, because of the weak marketing system, led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country.
This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields.
And we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early 2002.
Not six months later, in July 2002, Ethiopia announced a major food crisis, to the same proportions as 1984: 14 million people at risk of starvation.
What also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains, and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain, farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market, not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent.
This is a tragic example of arrested development, or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks.
And this is not just specific to Ethiopia, but happens over and over, all over Africa.
Well, I'm not here today to lament about the situation, or wring my hands.
I am here to tell you that change is in the air.
Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions, or cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions.
Africa has learned, or is learning somewhat slowly, that markets don't happen by themselves.
In the 1980s, it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right.
There was a very influential book about that, which was mainly about getting governments out of the market.
We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives, but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market.
When conditions are right, we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa, just like anywhere else.
Nearly three years ago, I decided to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth, Ethiopia, after nearly 30 years abroad.
I did so for a simple reason.
After having spent more than a decade understanding, studying, and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets, I decided it was time to do something about it.
I currently lead, in Ethiopia, an exciting new initiative to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, or ECX.
Now, the commodity exchange itself, that concept, is not new to the world.
In fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves.
That was, of course, the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade, which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world.
The Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange.
In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market.
But once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found, or if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.
And in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan, rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms.
Well, the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market, and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done.
From there, the greatest innovation of all came about in this market, which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain.
That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances, and even across time -- as far forward as 18 months into the future.
This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture, and the rise of Chicago to a global market, agricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town.
Now, over the last century, we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of Western industrialized countries, and that the reference prices for cotton, coffee, cocoa -- products produced mainly in the south -- are actually a reference price, or a price discovered in these organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries.
But that is actually changing.
And we're seeing a shift -- powered mainly because of information technology -- a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets.
And over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges -- and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world -- has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade.
Similarly, there's been explosive growth in India, for example, where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here over the last three years by 270 percent a year.
This is powered by low-cost VSAT technology, aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.
China's Dalian Commodity Exchange, three years ago, 2004, overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world.
Now, in Ethiopia, we're in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.
We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model, but creating a system uniquely tailored to Ethiopia's needs and realities, Ethiopia's small farmers.
So, the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia.
We're creating a system that serves all market actors, that creates integrity, trust, efficiency, transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described.
In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia, we've done something rather unique, which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective, or what we call the ECX Edge.
The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself.
And this is because one of the things we've learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work.
You've got one donor trying to develop market information, another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards, another ICT, and yet another on warehousing, or warehouse receipts.
In our approach in Ethiopia, we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem, or environment, in which trade takes place.
That means that the exchange will operate a trading system, which will initially start as an open outcry, because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading.
But at the same time, we'll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done, which is itself to operate something like an Internet cafe in the rural areas.
So that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center -- what we call the remote access terminal centers -- and actually, without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things, simply see the trading that's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor.
At the same time, what's very fundamental to this market is that -- and again, an innovation that we've designed for our exchange -- is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country, in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done.
And in turn, we'll operate an in-house clearing system, to assure that payment is done appropriately, in the right amount and at the right time, so that basically, we create trust and integrity in the system.
Obviously, we work with exchange actors, and as we're developing the exchange market itself, we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework, the overarching legal framework for making this market work.
So, in fact, our proclamation is going to parliament next month.
What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country, using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers.
What this does is transforms, fundamentally, the farmers' relationship to the market.
Whereas before the farmer used to think local -- meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market, eight to 10 kilometers away on average, and sell whatever they happened to have, without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was -- now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.
And they start to think national, and even global.
They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions, but also planting decisions, on the basis of information coming from the futures price market.
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium.
So all of this will transform farmers.
It will also transform the way traders do business.
It will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas].
Can Ethiopia do this?
It seems very ambitious.
But it will create new opportunities.
We believe that this initiative requires great political will, and we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector, and really even the underlying legal framework.
We believe that the winds of change are here, and that we can do it.
ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium, which starts in about eight months.
The last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today.
We believe that the stakes are high, but that the returns will be even greater.
ECX, moreover, can become a trading platform for a pan-African market in agricultural commodities.
Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value.
And we feel that over the next five years, if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent, just 40 percent, of the domestic market, and add just 25 percent value to that market, the value of the market doubles.
Ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than South Africa's grain production, and, in fact, Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa.
So the potential is there.
The will is there.
The commitment is there.
So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture, and to change Africa.
So, we are in the business of finding our happiness.
Thank you very much.

Let's talk dirty.
A few years ago, oddly enough, I needed the bathroom, and I found one, a public bathroom, and I went into the stall, and I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life: use the toilet, flush the toilet, forget about the toilet.
And for some reason that day, instead, I asked myself a question, and it was, where does this stuff go?
And with that question, I found myself plunged into the world of sanitation -- there's more coming -- — sanitation, toilets and poop, and I have yet to emerge.
And that's because it's such an enraging, yet engaging place to be.
To go back to that toilet, it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet, it wasn't as nice as this one from the World Toilet Organization.
That's the other WTO.
But it had a lockable door, it had privacy, it had water, it had soap so I could wash my hands, and I did because I'm a woman, and we do that.
But that day, when I asked that question, I learned something, and that was that I'd grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right, when in fact it's a privilege.
2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet.
They don't have a bucket or a box.
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet.
And they have to do what this little boy is doing by the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway, which is called open defecation, or poo-pooing in the open.
And he does that every day, and every day, probably, that guy in the picture walks on by, because he sees that little boy, but he doesn't see him.
But he should, because the problem with all that poop lying around is that poop carries passengers.
Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit.
All those things, the eggs, the cysts, the bacteria, the viruses, all those can travel in one gram of human feces.
How? Well, that little boy will not have washed his hands.
He's barefoot. He'll run back into his house, and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet.
In what I call the flushed-and-plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in, the most common symptoms associated with those diseases, diarrhea, is now a bit of a joke.
It's the runs, the Hershey squirts, the squits.
Where I come from, we call it Delhi belly, as a legacy of empire.
But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency, this is the picture that you come up with.
Still not sure about the bikini.
And here's another image of diarrhea.
This is Marie Saylee, nine months old.
You can't see her, because she's buried under that green grass in a little village in Liberia, because she died in three days from diarrhea -- the Hershey squirts, the runs, a joke.
And that's her dad.
But she wasn't alone that day, because 4,000 other children died of diarrhea, and they do every day.
Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide, and you've probably been asked to care about things like HIV/AIDS or T.B. or measles, but diarrhea kills more children than all those three things put together.
It's a very potent weapon of mass destruction.
And the cost to the world is immense: 260 billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation.
These are cholera beds in Haiti.
You'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea.
It gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases.
But we know how to fix this.
We know, because in the mid-19th century, wonderful Victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet, and disease dropped dramatically.
Child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history.
The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal, and they were choosing over the Pill, anesthesia, and surgery.
It's a wonderful waste disposal device.
But I think that it's so good — it doesn't smell, we can put it in our house, we can lock it behind a door — and I think we've locked it out of conversation too.
We don't have a neutral word for it.
Poop's not particularly adequate.
Shit offends people. Feces is too medical.
Because I can't explain otherwise, when I look at the figures, what's going on.
We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation, but if you look at the budgets of countries, developing and developed, you'll think there's something wrong with the math, because you'll expect absurdities like Pakistan spending 47 times more on its military than it does on water and sanitation, even though 150,000 children die of diarrhea in Pakistan every year.
But then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget, and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply, which is great; we all need water.
No one's going to refuse clean water.
But the humble latrine, or flush toilet, reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water.
Think about it. That little boy who's running back into his house, he may have a nice, clean fresh water supply, but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with.
And I think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development, because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us.
So a toilet can put a girl back in school.
Twenty-five percent of girls in India drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation.
They've been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in.
We've all done that, but they do it every day, and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating, it just gets too much.
And I understand that. Who can blame them?
So if you met an educationalist and said, "I can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent with just one simple thing," you'd make a lot of friends in education.
That's not the only thing it can do for you.
Poop can cook your dinner.
It's got nutrients in it.
We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well.
We don't keep them all.
In Rwanda, they are now getting 75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners' bowels.
So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare.
They're genocidal inmates, most of them, and they're stirring the contents of their own latrines, because if you put poop in a sealed environment, in a tank, pretty much like a stomach, then, pretty much like a stomach, it gives off gas, and you can cook with it.
And you might think it's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit, but it's also good economic sense, because they're saving a million dollars a year.
They're cutting down on deforestation, and they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible, infinite and free at the point of production.
It's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives.
Here's a woman who's about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes, which is what you think it is, except not quite, because it's actually donated.
There is now a new career path called stool donor.
It's like the new sperm donor.
Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff, and it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases.
She's been suffering for years.
She gets a dose of healthy human feces, and the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent.
It's astonishing, but hardly anyone is still doing it.
Maybe it's the ick factor.
That's okay, because there's a team of research scientists in Canada who have now created a stool sample, a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate.
So you'd be thinking by now, okay, the solution's simple, we give everyone a toilet.
And this is where it gets really interesting, because it's not that simple, because we are not simple.
So the really interesting, exciting work -- this is the engaging bit -- in sanitation is that we need to understand human psychology.
We need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware.
They've found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that they've got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms with their owners happily walking past them and going over to the open defecating ground.
So the idea is to manipulate human emotion.
It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it in the early 20th century.
They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.
They tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it.
In India now there's a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don't have a toilet.
It's called "No Loo, No I Do."
And in case you think that poster's just propaganda, here's Priyanka, 23 years old.
I met her last October in India, and she grew up in a conservative environment.
She grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India, and she was engaged at 14, and then at 21 or so, she moved into her in-law's house.
And she was horrified to get there and find that they didn't have a toilet.
She'd grown up with a latrine.
It was no big deal, but it was a latrine.
And the first night she was there, she was told that at 4 o'clock in the morning -- her mother-in-law got her up, told her to go outside and go and do it in the dark in the open.
And she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around.
She was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape.
After three days, she did an unthinkable thing.
She left.
And if you know anything about rural India, you'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do.
But not just that.
She got her toilet, and now she goes around all the other villages in India persuading other women to do the same thing.
It's what I call social contagion, and it's really powerful and really exciting.
Another version of this, another village in India near where Priyanka lives is this village, called Lakara, and about a year ago, it had no toilets whatsoever.
Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera.
Some visitors came, using various behavioral change tricks like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit and watching the flies go one to the other.
Somehow, people who'd been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all suddenly thought, "Oops."
Not only that, but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit.
That's what really made them change their behavior.
So this woman, this boy's mother installed this latrine in a few hours.
Her entire life, she'd been using the banana field behind, but she installed the latrine in a few hours.
It cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life.
So when I get despondent about the state of sanitation, even though these are pretty exciting times because we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation reinventing the toilet, which is great, we've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike, which is great for humanity, very bad for his colon.
But there are things to worry about.
It's the most off-track Millennium Development Goal.
It's about 50 or so years off track.
We're not going to meet targets, providing people with sanitation at this rate.
So when I get sad about sanitation, I think of Japan, because Japan 70 years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks, and now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos, washlet toilets.
They have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely, hands-free cleaning experience, and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device which is known as the "marriage-saver."
But most importantly, what they have done in Japan, which I find so inspirational, is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door.
They've made it conversational.
People go out and upgrade their toilet.
They talk about it. They've sanitized it.
I hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do.
All we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent, shameful issue that it is.
And don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong.
Our sewers are crumbling.
Things are going wrong here too.
The solution to all of this is pretty easy.
I'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing, and that's to go out, protest, speak about the unspeakable, and talk shit.
Thank you.

<title>Rose George: Let's talk crap. Seriously.</title>
<description>It's 2013, yet 2.5 billion people in the world have no access to a basic sanitary toilet. And when there's no loo, where do you poo? In the street, probably near your water and food sources -- causing untold death and disease from contamination. Get ready for a blunt, funny, powerful talk from journalist Rose George about a once-unmentionable problem.</description>
<keywords>global issues,health,smell,water</keywords>

So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills and why this is an incredibly important, long, oily, hot summer, and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted.
But before I talk about the political chemistry, I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil.
This is a photograph from when I visited Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 2002 to watch the Minerals Management Service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice.
And what you see here is, you see a little bit of crude oil, you see some ice cubes, and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm.
The napalm is burning there quite nicely.
And the thing is, is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer.
We're four percent of the world's population; we use 25 percent of the world's oil production.
And we don't really understand what oil is, until you check out its molecules, And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn.
So this is what happens as that burn gets going.
It takes off. It's a big woosh.
I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday, because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again.
It'll just bake your retinas.
So there it is; the retinas are baking.
Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil.
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules.
It starts of with the very small ones, which are one carbon, four hydrogen -- that's methane -- it just floats off.
Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon.
You've probably heard of benzene rings; they're very carcinogenic.
And it goes all the way over to these big, thick, galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons, and they have thousands of hydrogens, and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them.
Those are called the asphaltenes; they're an ingredient in asphalt.
They're very important in oil spills.
Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water.
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous.
Oil doesn't sink, it floats.
If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water.
It spreads out to be really thin, so you have a hard time corralling it.
The next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate, and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that, and shrimp.
And then the asphaltenes -- and this is the crucial thing -- the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion, something like mayonnaise.
It triples the amount of oily, messy goo that you have in the water, and it makes it very hard to handle.
It also makes it very viscous.
When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain, there were big, floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil, with the consistency, or the viscosity, of chewing gum.
It's incredibly hard to clean up.
And every single oil is different when it hits water.
When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics, it's absolutely explosive.
For the first time, American consumers will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves.
They have a "eureka!" moment, when we suddenly understand oil in a different context.
So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics, because it's really crucial to understanding why this summer is so important, why we need to stay focused.
Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks, "Wow! I'm going to go buy some three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work."
No, they think, "Ugh. I have to go buy gas.
I'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off.
They set the prices, and I don't even know.
I am helpless over this."
And this is what happens to us at the gas pump -- and actually, gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger.
You might notice that many gas pumps, including this one, are designed to look like ATMs.
I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger, because supposedly we feel good about ATMs.
That shows you how bad it is.
But actually, I mean, this feeling of helplessness comes in because most Americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy, not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market.
And the thing is, too, is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume, which is somewhat reasonable, because in fact, we have designed this system where, if you want to get a job, it's much more important to have a car that runs, to have a job and keep a job, than to have a GED.
And that's actually very perverse.
Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas, which is that we'd rather be doing anything else.
This is BP's gas station in downtown Los Angeles.
It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.
"Now," you think, "why would something so lame work on people so smart?"
Well, the reason is, is because, when we're buying gas, we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance.
I mean, we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else.
We don't want to be buying oil; we want to be doing something green.
And we get kind of in on our own con.
I mean -- and this is funny, it looks funny here.
But in fact, that's why the slogan "beyond petroleum" worked.
But it's an inherent part of our energy policy, which is we don't talk about reducing the amount of oil that we use.
We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars.
We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet.
And so, cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil, and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill.
Okay, so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States.
The oil industry is like a huge, gigantic octopus of engineering and finance and everything else, but we actually see it in very moral terms.
This is an early-on photograph -- you can see, we had these gushers.
Early journalists looked at these spills, and they said, "This is a filthy industry."
But they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing.
They weren't farmers, they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground.
It's the "Beverly Hillbillies," basically.
But in the beginning, this was seen as a very morally problematic thing, long before it became funny.
And then, of course, there was John D. Rockefeller.
And the thing about John D. is that he went into this chaotic wild-east of oil industry, and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company, a multinational.
It was terrifying; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now, imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s.
And it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy.
But what's really amazing is that Ida Tarbell, the journalist, went in and did a big exposé of Rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place.
But in many ways, that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us.
And here's one of the things that Ida Tarbell said -- she said, "He has a thin nose like a thorn.
There were no lips.
There were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them."
Okay, so that guy is actually still with us.
I mean, this is a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA.
And then there's this guy, okay.
So, you might be wondering why it is that, every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill, we call these CEOs down to Washington, and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them.
And this is something that we've been doing since 1974, when we first asked them, "Why are there these obscene profits?"
And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs.
And we take it as, you know -- we look at it on a moral level, rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level.
And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions -- I'm just saying that, when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards, you don't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate, or you're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil.
So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction.
But it makes for good theater, and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week.
So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing.
I mean, these pictures -- this is from the Santa Barbara spill.
You have these pictures of birds.
They really influence people.
When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969, it formed the environmental movement in its modern form.
It started Earth Day.
It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period.
I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us.
Here we are normally; we're standing at the gas pump, and we're feeling kind of helpless.
We look at these pictures and we understand, for the first time, our role in this supply chain.
We connect the dots in the supply chain.
And we have this kind of -- as voters, we have kind of a "eureka!" moment.
This is why these moments of these oil spills are so important.
But it's also really important that we don't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it.
We actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem.
One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms.
We were very reactive, as opposed to being proactive about what happened.
And so what we did was, actually, we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling.
We stopped drilling in ANWR, but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed.
In fact, it's continued to increase.
The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices.
As you can see, our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out.
We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves; 65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf.
One of the things that's happened because of this is that, since 1969, the country of Nigeria, or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil, which is the delta -- which is two times the size of Maryland -- has had thousands of oil spills a year.
I mean, we've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations.
That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill every year since 1969.
And we can wrap our heads around the spills, because that's what we see here, but in fact, these guys actually live in a war zone.
There's a thousand battle-related deaths a year in this area twice the size of Maryland, and it's all related to the oil.
And these guys, I mean, if they were in the U.S., they might be actually here in this room.
They have degrees in political science, degrees in business -- they're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing.
And it's sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us.
The other thing that we've done, as we've continued to increase demand, is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs.
One of the places we put in a big oil project in Chad, with Exxon.
So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it; the World Bank, Exxon paid for it.
We put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem.
I was there in 2003.
We were driving along this dark, dark road, and the guy in the green stepped out, and I was just like, "Ahhh! This is it."
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out, and we realized it was okay.
They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields.
But at the same time, Chad has become much more unstable, and we are not paying for that price at the pump.
We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th.
We do the same thing with the price of policing the Persian Gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open.
This is 1988 -- we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year.
That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump.
We pay for it on April 15th, and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement.
The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the Gulf of Mexico, which was not part of the moratoriums.
Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico -- as you can see, this is the Minerals Management diagram of wells for gas and oil.
It's become this intense industrialized zone.
It doesn't have the same resonance for us that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has, but it should, I mean, it's a bird sanctuary.
Also, every time you buy gasoline in the United States, half of it is actually being refined along the coast, because the Gulf actually has about 50 percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals as well.
So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less-clean environment.
And finally, American families also pay a price for oil.
Now on the one hand, the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil, but on the other hand, the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work, generally in a fairly crummy car.
If you look at people who make $50,000 a year, they have two kids, they might have three jobs or more, and then they have to really commute.
They're actually spending more on their car and fuel than they are on taxes or on health care.
And the same thing happens at the 50th percentile, around 80,000.
Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the American economy, but they're also a drain on individual families and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher.
So, what I'm going to talk to you about now is: what do we have to do this time?
What are the laws? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused?
One thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater.
We need to stay away from the moratoriums.
We need to focus really back again on the molecules.
The moratoriums are fine, but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil.
One of the things that we also need to do, is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world, before you reduce the amount of oil that we use.
We need to focus on reducing the oil.
What you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy.
It comes in on the side -- the useful stuff is the dark gray, and the un-useful stuff, which is called the rejected energy -- the waste, goes up to the top.
Now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount.
And one of the things that we need to do is, not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient, but we also need to fix the economy in general.
We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel.
For example, we have an insurance system where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000.
We actually encourage people to drive more.
We have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies.
We need to have more mobility choices.
We need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil.
And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry, which is at least 10 billion dollars a year, into something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute.
Whether that's getting a much more efficient car and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road, this is where we need to be.
We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing, and you can find more about this policy.
It's called STRONG, which is "Secure Transportation Reducing Oil Needs Gradually," and the idea is instead of being helpless, we need to be more strong.
They're up at NewAmerica.net.
What's important about these is that we try to move from feeling helpless at the pump, to actually being active and to really sort of thinking about who we are, having kind of that special moment, where we connect the dots actually at the pump.
Now supposedly, oil taxes are the third rail of American politics -- the no-fly zone.
I actually -- I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much, but I think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline, and upped it to six cents next year, nine cents the following year, all the way up to 30 cents by 2020, that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption, and at the same time we would give people time to prepare, time to respond, and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time.
Let me give you a little sense of how this would work.
This is a gas receipt, hypothetically, for a year from now.
The first thing that you have on the tax is -- you have a tax for a stronger America -- 33 cents.
So you're not helpless at the pump.
And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign, very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack.
And what it says is, "The National Academy of Sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates 29 cents in health care costs."
That's a lot.
And so this -- you can see that you're paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax.
And also, the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system.
And at the same time, you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting, or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car, or whatever it is you're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence.
With this whole sort of suite of policies, we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption -- or our oil consumption -- by 20 percent by 2020.
So, three million barrels a day.
But in order to do this, one of the things we really need to do, is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon.
We need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater, not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there.
We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules.
Thank you.

I'd like to ask you, what do these three people have in common?
Well, you probably recognize the first person.
I'm sure you're all avid "American Idol" watchers.
But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani, who is a contestant, indeed a finalist, in the Poet of the Millions competition, which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi, and seen throughout the Arab world.
In this contest people have to write and recite original poetry, in the Nabati form of poetry, which is the traditional Bedouin form.
And Lima Sahar was a finalist in the Afghan Star singing competition.
Now, before I go any further, yes, I know it all began with "Britain's Got Talent."
But my point in discussing this is to show you -- I hope I'll be able to show you how these merit-based competitions, with equal access to everyone, with the winner selected via voting by SMS, are changing tribal societies.
And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with the UAE, how they're changing tribal societies, not by introducing Western ideas, but by being integrated into the language in those places.
It all begins with enjoyment.
We are late to watch "Afghan Star."
We are going to watch "Afghan Star." We are late.
We are running late.
We must go to watch "Afghan Star."
Cynthia Schneider: These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society.
In Afghanistan, people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program.
And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set.
People watch it all over the country also in public places.
But it goes beyond watching, because also, part of this is campaigning.
People become so engaged that they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway, who fan out over the countryside, campaigning for their candidate.
Contestants also put themselves forward.
Now, of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance, but not entirely.
Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group.
This has opened up the door, particularly for women.
And in the last season there were two women in the finalists.
One of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar, a very conservative part of the country.
And here she relates, in the documentary film "Afghan Star," how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy.
But she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS-ing votes in for her.
Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out, to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition.
I have to say, her husband backed her from the start.
But her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it.
But, once she started to win, then they got behind her again.
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value.
And she's out there.
Her poetry is about women, and the life of women in society.
So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men -- this shows the voting on the program -- it sets a very important example for young women -- these are young women in the audience of the program -- in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.
Now you'd think that "American Idol" would introduce a measure of Americanization.
But actually, just the opposite is happening.
By using this engaging popular format for traditional, local culture, it actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revival of interest in Nabati poetry, also in traditional dress and dance and music.
And for Afghanistan, where the Taliban banned music for many years, it is reintroducing their traditional music.
They don't sing pop songs, they sing Afghan music.
And they also have learned how to lose gracefully, without avenging the winner.
No small thing.
And the final, sort of, formulation of this "American Idol" format, which has just appeared in Afghanistan, is a new program called "The Candidate."
And in this program, people present policy platforms that are then voted on.
Many of them are too young to run for president, but by putting the issues out there, they are influencing the presidential race.
So for me, the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving reality.
Thank you.

I am a reformed marketer, and I now work in international development.
In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the [second] largest country in Africa.
In fact, it's as large as Western Europe, but it only has 300 miles of paved roads.
The DRC is a dangerous place.
In the past 10 years, five million people have died due to a war in the east.
But war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC.
There are many health issues as well.
In fact, the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults.
This might not sound like a large number, but in a country with 76 million people, it means there are 930,000 that are infected.
And due to the poor infrastructure, only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.
Which is why, in part, donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost.
And so while I was in the DRC, I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms, including Damien.
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.
It's a hotel that's only open until midnight, so it's not a place that you stay.
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.
Now Damien knows all about condoms, but he doesn't sell them.
He said there's just not in demand.
It's not surprising, because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms.
Joseph and Christine, who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms, said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost, and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them, their customers don't buy the branded versions.
They like the generics.
And as a marketer, I found that curious.
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like.
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms: fear, financing and fidelity.
They name the condoms things like Vive, "to live" or Trust.
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV, put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them, show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently.
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom.
What is it that you think about just before you get a condom?
Sex!
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places, they understand this.
Their marketing is slightly different.
The name might not be much different, but the imagery sure is.
Some brands are aspirational, and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative.
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing: understanding who's the audience.
And for donor agencies, unfortunately, the audience tends to be people that aren't even in the country they're working [in].
It's people back home, people that support their work, people like these.
But if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV, we need to think about the customer, the people whose behavior needs to change -- the couples, the young women, the young men -- whose lives depend on it.
And so the lesson is this: it doesn't really matter what you're selling; you just have to think about who is your customer, and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior.
It might just save their lives.
Thank you.

I have a confession to make, but first, I want you to make a little confession to me.
In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced relatively little stress.
Anyone?
How about a moderate amount of stress?
Who has experienced a lot of stress?
Yeah. Me too.
But that is not my confession.
My confession is this: I am a health psychologist, and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier.
But I fear that something I've been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good, and it has to do with stress.
For years I've been telling people, stress makes you sick.
It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease.
Basically, I've turned stress into the enemy.
But I have changed my mind about stress, and today, I want to change yours.
Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress.
This study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years, and they started by asking people, "How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"
They also asked, "Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?"
And then they used public death records to find out who died.
Okay. Some bad news first.
People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying.
But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health.
People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die.
In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had relatively little stress.
Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths, 182,000 Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief that stress is bad for you.
That is over 20,000 deaths a year.
Now, if that estimate is correct, that would make believing stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year, killing more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS and homicide.
You can see why this study freaked me out.
Here I've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health.
So this study got me wondering: Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier? And here the science says yes.
When you change your mind about stress, you can change your body's response to stress.
Now to explain how this works, I want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out.
It's called the social stress test.
You come into the laboratory, and you're told you have to give a five-minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you, and to make sure you feel the pressure, there are bright lights and a camera in your face, kind of like this.
And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging, non-verbal feedback like this.
Now that you're sufficiently demoralized, time for part two: a math test.
And unbeknownst to you, the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it.
Now we're going to all do this together.
It's going to be fun.
For me.
Okay. I want you all to count backwards from 996 in increments of seven.
You're going to do this out loud as fast as you can, starting with 996.
Go!
Audience: Go faster. Faster please.
You're going too slow.
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
That guy made a mistake.
We are going to have to start all over again.
You're not very good at this, are you?
Okay, so you get the idea.
Now, if you were actually in this study, you'd probably be a little stressed out.
Your heart might be pounding, you might be breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a sweat.
And normally, we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure.
But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized, was preparing you to meet this challenge?
Now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University.
Before they went through the social stress test, they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful.
That pounding heart is preparing you for action.
If you're breathing faster, it's no problem.
It's getting more oxygen to your brain.
And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance, well, they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident, but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed.
Now, in a typical stress response, your heart rate goes up, and your blood vessels constrict like this.
And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease.
It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time.
But in the study, when participants viewed their stress response as helpful, their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this.
Their heart was still pounding, but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile.
It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage.
Over a lifetime of stressful experiences, this one biological change could be the difference between a stress-induced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s.
And this is really what the new science of stress reveals, that how you think about stress matters.
So my goal as a health psychologist has changed.
I no longer want to get rid of your stress.
I want to make you better at stress.
And we just did a little intervention.
If you raised your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress in the last year, we could have saved your life, because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress, you're going to remember this talk and you're going to think to yourself, this is my body helping me rise to this challenge.
And when you view stress in that way, your body believes you, and your stress response becomes healthier.
Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from, so we are going to do one more intervention.
I want to tell you about one of the most under-appreciated aspects of the stress response, and the idea is this: Stress makes you social.
To understand this side of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin, and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get.
It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone, because it's released when you hug someone.
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in.
Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone.
It fine-tunes your brain's social instincts.
It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships.
Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family.
It enhances your empathy.
It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about.
Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin to become more compassionate and caring.
But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin.
It's a stress hormone.
Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response.
It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound.
And when oxytocin is released in the stress response, it is motivating you to seek support.
Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it up.
Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other.
When life is difficult, your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you.
Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier?
Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain.
It also acts on your body, and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress.
It's a natural anti-inflammatory.
It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress.
But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart.
Your heart has receptors for this hormone, and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress-induced damage.
This stress hormone strengthens your heart, and the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support, so when you reach out to others under stress, either to seek support or to help someone else, you release more of this hormone, your stress response becomes healthier, and you actually recover faster from stress.
I find this amazing, that your stress response has a built-in mechanism for stress resilience, and that mechanism is human connection.
I want to finish by telling you about one more study.
And listen up, because this study could also save a life.
This study tracked about 1,000 adults in the United States, and they ranged in age from 34 to 93, and they started the study by asking, "How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"
They also asked, "How much time have you spent helping out friends, neighbors, people in your community?"
And then they used public records for the next five years to find out who died.
Okay, so the bad news first: For every major stressful life experience, like financial difficulties or family crisis, that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent.
But -- and I hope you are expecting a but by now -- but that wasn't true for everyone.
People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying. Zero.
Caring created resilience.
And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable.
How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress.
When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage.
And when you choose to connect with others under stress, you can create resilience.
Now I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life, but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress.
Stress gives us access to our hearts.
The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others, and yes, your pounding physical heart, working so hard to give you strength and energy, and when you choose to view stress in this way, you're not just getting better at stress, you're actually making a pretty profound statement.
You're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges, and you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone.
Thank you.
This is kind of amazing, what you're telling us.
It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy.
How would that extend to advice, like, if someone is making a lifestyle choice between, say, a stressful job and a non-stressful job, does it matter which way they go?
It's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it, in some sense?
Kelly McGonigal: Yeah, and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort.
And so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions, is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.
Thank you so much, Kelly. It's pretty cool. KM: Thank you.

<title>Kelly McGonigal: How to make stress your friend</title>
<description>Stress. It makes your heart pound, your breathing quicken and your forehead sweat. But while stress has been made into a public health enemy, new research suggests that stress may only be bad for you if you believe that to be the case. Psychologist Kelly McGonigal urges us to see stress as a positive, and introduces us to an unsung mechanism for stress reduction: reaching out to others.</description>

The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B+.
What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.
And I'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within, and to follow the TED commandments: that is, actually, something that creates a near-death experience, but near-death is good for creativity.
OK.
So, I also want to explain, because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.
And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.
When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily; I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong.
And I'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process, which includes a number of things that happened, actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I'm creating something new.
And that includes nature, and nurture, and what I refer to as nightmares.
Now in the nature area, we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something, perhaps in our brains, some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect.
And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.
And others, like my mother, would say that I get my material from past lives.
Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk -- van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.
I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic, that he might have had temporal lobe seizures, and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't -- I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.
And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago, but it was during the time I was writing my last book, and some people say that book is quite different.
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis: you know, who am I, why am I this particular person, why am I not black like everybody else?
And sometimes you're equipped with skills, but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.
I used to draw. I thought I would be an artist.
And I had a miniature poodle.
And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.
And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be, and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad, but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words.
Also, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had, and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.
That figure right there, by the way, figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old, and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.
I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15, this was supposed to be my side occupation, and it led to a sense of failure.
But actually, there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14.
And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father, six months later, had brain tumors.
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong, and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.
My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles, and that God's will would take care of that.
But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.
And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened.
Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness.
There was a reason for everything.
And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother, who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.
And so, I had this notion of death all around me, because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon, you begin to think very much about everything.
You become very creative, in a survival sense.
And this, then, led to my big questions.
And they're the same ones that I have today.
And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?
And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?
It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.
Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300, you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen, in what order they happen. What are the influences?
How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?
And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.
It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe, as the creator of that universe.
And you see, there's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out -- years and years, oftentimes.
So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference, almost everything that's been going on.
And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association: quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand, but I'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor.
So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.
There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.
But when you make those associations, you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story, and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning.
And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.
There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics, as I understand it.
And this happens constantly in the writing.
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about. And if you try too hard, then you will only write the about.
You won't discover anything.
And what you were supposed to find, what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way, is no longer there.
Now, I don't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe, like many of our scientists have.
And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here, and just say that creative people are multidimensional, and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.
And they all operate at the same time.
There is also a big question of ambiguity.
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.
And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable in my life, and I have it. Moral ambiguity.
It is constantly there. And, just as an example, this is one that recently came to me.
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said, "Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."
A very famous Chinese saying, she said.
And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there until things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years.
So, there was another one that I came across, and it's "saving fish from drowning."
And it's what Buddhist fishermen say, because they're not supposed to kill anything.
And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning, and unfortunately, in the process the fish die.
Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors -- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation, and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me: "save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."
And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business, or you're going to get stuck.
OK. I think if somebody really was drowning, she'd save them.
But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning, or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions.
And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.
And then we have intentions.
There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do, and then we do something.
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.
Maybe things go wrong. And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?
What are we supposed to do?
Do we stay in for life, or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good, and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?
That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called "Saving Fish From Drowning."
I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.
I got these hints everywhere.
And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.
And then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues, and I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.
And what I need, in effect, is a focus.
And when I have the question, it is a focus.
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.
And it seems like it's happening all the time.
You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity, in which you're getting all this help from the universe.
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.
And you are noticing it more often.
But you apply this.
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.
Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?
Why or why not?
It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as I said, human rights in Burma.
I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show that I approved of the military regime there.
And then, after a while, I had to ask myself, "Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us?"
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up, and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father, who was a Baptist minister.
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know that if I went there, what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later, when the time came.
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.
We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?
Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals, so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?
Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at, and we talked about today, is genocide.
This leads to this question.
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable, and I consider what my intentions should be, I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life, and what is my place in the universe?
It seems so obvious, and yet it is not.
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense, and yet it is also absolutely necessary.
In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.
Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book, because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally, from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time, I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself, and that actually was the way it happened.
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.
There are also things, quite uncanny, which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.
In this case, I was writing a story that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.
And I needed to find something historically that would match that.
And I took down this book, and I -- first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period, and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion, happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that, and a character who thought he was the son of God.
You wonder, are these things random chance?
Well, what is random? What is chance? What is luck?
What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?
And that goes into the story, too.
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.
Especially when good things happen, and, in particular, when bad things happen.
But I do think there's a kind of serendipity, and I do want to know what those elements are, so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.
Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place, and we ended up in this non-tourist location, a beautiful village, pristine.
And we walked three valleys beyond, and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous, a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.
And in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.
For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building.
And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.
I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs, that I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later, walking along the beach, I came across this.
And it was a man, a Chinese man, and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.
And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"
And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story, and I cannot explain it.
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things?
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?
A big thing that I also think about is accidents.
And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.
What is the nature of accidents?
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are, outside of a court of law?
I was able to see that in a firsthand way, when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.
And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China.
And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.
And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went, there was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep, and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.
60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.
Responsibility was assigned to the family.
The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.
And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.
It's the son, not the father."
When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.
It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.
And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.
And I began to sense something different about the history, and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village, and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links with other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using, a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men -- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.
Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners, would say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while, and seeing the amazing things that happened, you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world, determining how things happen.
So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story, the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me -- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real, and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.
Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly, as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.
The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.
It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.
But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?
And how do I create my own life?
And I think it is by questioning, and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.
I believe in specifics, the specifics of story, and the past, the specifics of that past, and what is happening in the story at that point.
I also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents, God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces -- I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.
I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe, and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?
And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined -- and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.
And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.
And they have to be in all possibilities, including those I never considered before.
So, there are never complete answers.
Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything, and that is good, because then I will discover something new.
And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me, it is to simply imagine.
And to imagine is to put myself in that story, until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.
And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story -- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think, to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.
Because for everything, in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.
We've come to the end of the talk, and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse, and it is the things that transform in our lives, that are wonderful and stay with us.
There she is.
Thank you very much!

<title>Amy Tan: Where does creativity hide?</title>
<description>Novelist Amy Tan digs deep into the creative process, looking for hints of how hers evolved.</description>
<keywords>arts,culture,entertainment,storytelling,writing</keywords>

Two years ago, I was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating 100 years of Islamic art in Europe.
The curator had only one condition: I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork.
Now, as an artist, a woman, an Arab, or a human being living in the world in 2010, I only had one thing to say: I wanted to say no.
And in Arabic, to say "no," we say "no, and a thousand times no."
So I decided to look for a thousand different noes.
on everything ever produced under Islamic or Arab patronage in the past 1,400 years, from Spain to the borders of China.
I collected my findings in a book, placed them chronologically, stating the name, the patron, the medium and the date.
Now, the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation, which stood three by seven meters, in Munich, Germany, in September of 2010.
Now, in January, 2011, the revolution started, and life stopped for 18 days, and on the 12th of February, we naively celebrated on the streets of Cairo, believing that the revolution had succeeded.
Nine months later I found myself spraying messages in Tahrir Square. The reason for this act was this image that I saw in my newsfeed.
I did not feel that I could live in a city where people were being killed and thrown like garbage on the street.
So I took one "no" off a tombstone from the Islamic Museum in Cairo, and I added a message to it: "no to military rule."
And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo.
But that led to a series of no, coming out of the book like ammunition, and adding messages to them, and I started spraying them on the walls.
So I'll be sharing some of these noes with you.
No to a new Pharaoh, because whoever comes next should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator.
No to violence: Ramy Essam came to Tahrir on the second day of the revolution, and he sat there with this guitar, singing.
One month after Mubarak stepped down, this was his reward.
No to blinding heroes. Ahmed Harara lost his right eye on the 28th of January, and he lost his left eye on the 19th of November, by two different snipers.
No to killing, in this case no to killing men of religion, because Sheikh Ahmed Adina Refaat was shot on December 16th, during a demonstration, leaving behind three orphans and a widow.
No to burning books. The Institute of Egypt was burned on December 17th, a huge cultural loss.
No to stripping the people, and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped and beaten on the street, and the footprint reads, "Long live a peaceful revolution," because we will never retaliate with violence.
No to barrier walls. On February 5th, concrete roadblocks were set up in Cairo to protect the Ministry of Defense from protesters.
Now, speaking of walls, I want to share with you the story of one wall in Cairo.
A group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank on a wall. It's one to one.
In front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head. To any passerby, there's no problem with this visual.
After acts of violence, another artist came, painted blood, protesters being run over by the tank, demonstrators, and a message that read, "Starting tomorrow, I wear the new face, the face of every martyr. I exist."
Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank and adds a message: "Army and people, one hand. Egypt for Egyptians."
Another artist comes, paints the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank.
Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank, leaves the suit, and throws a bucket of black paint just to hide the face of the monster.
So I come with my stencils, and I spray them on the suit, on the tank, and on the whole wall, and this is how it stands today until further notice.
Now, I want to leave you with a final no.
I found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in Tahrir, and I decided to take a no of Mamluk Mausoleum in Cairo.
The message reads, [Arabic] "You can crush the flowers, but you can't delay spring."
Thank you.
Thank you. Shukran.

<title>Bahia Shehab: A thousand times no</title>
<description>Art historian Bahia Shehab has long been fascinated with the Arabic script for 'no.' When revolution swept through Egypt in 2011, she began spraying the image in the streets saying no to dictators, no to military rule and no to violence.</description>

In half a century of trying to help prevent wars, there's one question that never leaves me: How do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return?
When you're faced with brutality, whether it's a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence -- or, on the streets of Syria today, facing tanks and shrapnel, what's the most effective thing to do?
Fight back? Give in?
Use more force?
This question: "How do I deal with a bully without becoming a thug in return?"
has been with me ever since I was a child.
I remember I was about 13, glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents' living room as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest, and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down.
And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase.
And my mother came up and said, "What on Earth are you doing?"
And I said, "I'm going to Budapest."
And she said, "What on Earth for?"
And I said, "Kids are getting killed there.
There's something terrible happening."
And she said, "Don't be so silly."
And I started to cry.
And she got it, she said, "Okay, I see it's serious.
You're much too young to help.
You need training. I'll help you.
But just unpack your suitcase."
And so I got some training and went and worked in Africa during most of my 20s.
But I realized that what I really needed to know I couldn't get from training courses.
I wanted to understand how violence, how oppression, works.
And what I've discovered since is this: Bullies use violence in three ways.
They use political violence to intimidate, physical violence to terrorize and mental or emotional violence to undermine.
And only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence.
Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence, and 27 years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills, the incredible skills, that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy.
And they did it in a total devotion to non-violence.
They realized that using force against force doesn't work.
So what does work?
Over time I've collected about a half-dozen methods that do work -- of course there are many more -- that do work and that are effective.
And the first is that the change that has to take place has to take place here, inside me.
It's my response, my attitude, to oppression that I've got control over, and that I can do something about.
And what I need to develop is self-knowledge to do that.
That means I need to know how I tick, when I collapse, where my formidable points are, where my weaker points are.
When do I give in?
What will I stand up for?
And meditation or self-inspection is one of the ways -- again it's not the only one -- it's one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power.
And my heroine here -- like Satish's -- is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma.
She was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of Rangoon.
They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns.
And she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her.
But she told the students to sit down.
And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun, put her hand on it and lower it.
And no one got killed.
So that's what the mastery of fear can do -- not only faced with machine guns, but if you meet a knife fight in the street.
But we have to practice.
So what about our fear?
I have a little mantra.
My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it.
And if it grows very big it probably happens.
So we all know the three o'clock in the morning syndrome, when something you've been worrying about wakes you up -- I see a lot of people -- and for an hour you toss and turn, it gets worse and worse, and by four o'clock you're pinned to the pillow by a monster this big.
The only thing to do is to get up, make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you.
You're the adult.
The fear is the child.
And you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants, what it needs.
How can this be made better?
How can the child feel stronger?
And you make a plan.
And you say, "Okay, now we're going back to sleep.
Half-past seven, we're getting up and that's what we're going to do."
I had one of these 3 a.m. episodes on Sunday -- paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you.
So I did the thing.
I got up, made the cup of tea, sat down with it, did it all and I'm here -- still partly paralyzed, but I'm here.
So that's fear. What about anger?
Wherever there is injustice there's anger.
But anger is like gasoline, and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match, you've got an inferno.
But anger as an engine -- in an engine -- is powerful.
If we can put our anger inside an engine, it can drive us forward, it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power.
And I learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy-makers.
Because at the beginning I was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong.
Totally ineffective.
In order to develop a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger.
It's okay to be angry with the thing -- the nuclear weapons in this case -- but it is hopeless to be angry with the people.
They are human beings just like us.
And they're doing what they think is best.
And that's the basis on which we have to talk with them.
So that's the third one, anger.
And it brings me to the crux of what's going on, or what I perceive as going on, in the world today, which is that last century was top-down power.
It was still governments telling people what to do.
This century there's a shift.
It's bottom-up or grassroots power.
It's like mushrooms coming through concrete.
It's people joining up with people, as Bundy just said, miles away to bring about change.
And Peace Direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict know what to do.
They know best what to do.
So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that.
And the kind of thing they're doing is demobilizing militias, rebuilding economies, resettling refugees, even liberating child soldiers.
And they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this.
And what they've realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane, but it's less effective than using methods that connect people with people, that rebuild.
And I think that the U.S. military is finally beginning to get this.
Up to now their counter-terrorism policy has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost, and if civilians get in the way, that's written as "collateral damage."
And this is so infuriating and humiliating for the population of Afghanistan, that it makes the recruitment for al-Qaeda very easy, when people are so disgusted by, for example, the burning of the Koran.
So the training of the troops has to change.
And I think there are signs that it is beginning to change.
The British military have always been much better at this.
But there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from, and that's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel called Chris Hughes.
And he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf -- in Iraq actually -- and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road, screaming, yelling, furiously angry, and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified, didn't know what was going on, couldn't speak Arabic.
And Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head, pointing at the ground, and he said, "Kneel."
And these huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor, wobbled to the ground.
And complete silence fell.
And after about two minutes, everybody moved aside and went home.
Now that to me is wisdom in action.
In the moment, that's what he did.
And it's happening everywhere now.
You don't believe me?
Have you asked yourselves why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last 30 years?
Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Mali, Madagascar, Poland, the Philippines, Serbia, Slovenia, I could go on, and now Tunisia and Egypt.
And this hasn't just happened.
A lot of it is due to a book written by an 80-year-old man in Boston, Gene Sharp.
He wrote a book called "From Dictatorship to Democracy" with 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance.
And it's been translated into 26 languages.
It's flown around the world.
And it's being used by young people and older people everywhere, because it works and it's effective.
So this is what gives me hope -- not just hope, this is what makes me feel very positive right now.
Because finally human beings are getting it.
We're getting practical, doable methodologies to answer my question: How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug?
We're using the kind of skills that I've outlined: inner power -- the development of inner power -- through self-knowledge, recognizing and working with our fear, using anger as a fuel, cooperating with others, banding together with others, courage, and most importantly, commitment to active non-violence.
Now I don't just believe in non-violence.
I don't have to believe in it.
I see evidence everywhere of how it works.
And I see that we, ordinary people, can do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Ghandi and Mandela did.
We can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known.
And we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as strengthening this incredible resolve.
And this open-heartedness is exactly what I've experienced in the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday.
Thank you.

I study how the brain processes information. That is, how it takes information in from the outside world, and converts it into patterns of electrical activity, and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things -- to see, hear, to reach for an object.
So I'm really a basic scientist, not a clinician, but in the last year and a half I've started to switch over, to use what we've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices, and what I wanted to do today is show you an example of this.
It's really our first foray into this.
It's the development of a prosthetic device for treating blindness.
So let me start in on that problem.
There are 10 million people in the U.S.
and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina, diseases like macular degeneration, and there's little that can be done for them.
There are some drug treatments, but they're only effective on a small fraction of the population. And so, for the vast majority of patients, their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices.
The problem is that current prosthetics don't work very well. They're still very limited in the vision that they can provide.
And so, you know, for example, with these devices, patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges, not very much more, so nothing close to normal vision has been possible.
So what I'm going to tell you about today is a device that we've been working on that I think has the potential to make a difference, to be much more effective, and what I wanted to do is show you how it works. Okay, so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve.
Here you have a retina.
So you have an image, a retina, and a brain.
So when you look at something, like this image of this baby's face, it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina, on the front-end cells here, the photoreceptors.
Then what happens is the retinal circuitry, the middle part, goes to work on it, and what it does is it performs operations on it, it extracts information from it, and it converts that information into a code.
And the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain, and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code. And when I say code, I do literally mean code.
Like this pattern of pulses here actually means "baby's face," and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses, it knows that what was out there was a baby's face, and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was, say, a dog, or another pattern would be a house.
Anyway, you get the idea.
And, of course, in real life, it's all dynamic, meaning that it's changing all the time, so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you're looking at is changing all the time too.
So, you know, it's sort of a complicated thing. You have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you're seeing.
So what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration? What happens is is that, the front-end cells die, the photoreceptors die, and over time, all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them, they die too.
Until the only things that you have left are these cells here, the output cells, the ones that send the signals to the brain, but because of all that degeneration they aren't sending any signals anymore.
They aren't getting any input, so the person's brain no longer gets any visual information -- that is, he or she is blind.
So, a solution to the problem, then, would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front-end circuitry and send signals to the retina's output cells, and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain.
So this is what we've been working on, and this is what our prosthetic does.
So it consists of two parts, what we call an encoder and a transducer.
And so the encoder does just what I was saying: it mimics the actions of the front-end circuitry -- so it takes images in and converts them into the retina's code.
And then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain, and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output.
So a completely blind retina, even one with no front-end circuitry at all, no photoreceptors, can now send out normal signals, signals that the brain can understand.
So no other device has been able to do this.
Okay, so I just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it's doing, because it's really the key part and it's sort of interesting and kind of cool.
I'm not sure "cool" is really the right word, but you know what I mean.
So what it's doing is, it's replacing the retinal circuitry, really the guts of the retinal circuitry, with a set of equations, a set of equations that we can implement on a chip. So it's just math.
In other words, we're not literally replacing the components of the retina.
It's not like we're making a little mini-device for each of the different cell types.
We've just abstracted what the retina's doing with a set of equations.
And so, in a way, the equations are serving as sort of a codebook. An image comes in, goes through the set of equations, and out comes streams of electrical pulses, just like a normal retina would produce.
Now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output, and what the implications of this are.
Here are three sets of firing patterns. The top one is from a normal animal, the middle one is from a blind animal that's been treated with this encoder-transducer device, and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic.
So the bottom one is the state-of-the-art device that's out there right now, which is basically made up of light detectors, but no encoder. So what we did was we presented movies of everyday things -- people, babies, park benches, you know, regular things happening -- and we recorded the responses from the retinas of these three groups of animals.
Now just to orient you, each box is showing the firing patterns of several cells, and just as in the previous slides, each row is a different cell, and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so I could show you a long stretch of data.
So as you can see, the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the encoder-transducer really do very closely match the normal firing patterns -- and it's not perfect, but it's pretty good -- and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic, the responses really don't.
And so with the standard method, the cells do fire, they just don't fire in the normal firing patterns because they don't have the right code.
How important is this?
What's the potential impact on a patient's ability to see?
So I'm just going to show you one bottom-line experiment that answers this, and of course I've got a lot of other data, so if you're interested I'm happy to show more. So the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment.
So what we did is we took a moment in time from these recordings and asked, what was the retina seeing at that moment?
Can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing from the responses from the firing patterns?
So, when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer.
So let me show you, and I'm going to start with the standard method first.
So you can see that it's pretty limited, and because the firing patterns aren't in the right code, they're very limited in what they can tell you about what's out there. So you can see that there's something there, but it's not so clear what that something is, and this just sort of circles back to what I was saying in the beginning, that with the standard method, patients can see high-contrast edges, they can see light, but it doesn't easily go further than that. So what was the image? It was a baby's face.
So what about with our approach, adding the code? And you can see that it's much better. Not only can you tell that it's a baby's face, but you can tell that it's this baby's face, which is a really challenging task.
So on the left is the encoder alone, and on the right is from an actual blind retina, so the encoder and the transducer.
But the key one really is the encoder alone, because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer.
This is just actually the first one that we tried.
I just wanted to say something about the standard method.
When this first came out, it was just a really exciting thing, the idea that you even make a blind retina respond at all.
But there was this limiting factor, the issue of the code, and how to make the cells respond better, produce normal responses, and so this was our contribution.
Now I just want to wrap up, and as I was mentioning earlier of course I have a lot of other data if you're interested, but I just wanted to give this sort of basic idea of being able to communicate with the brain in its language, and the potential power of being able to do that.
So it's different from the motor prosthetics where you're communicating from the brain to a device. Here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood, and be understood by the brain.
And then the last thing I wanted to say, really, is to emphasize that the idea generalizes.
So the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas, for example, the auditory system and the motor system, so for treating deafness and for motor disorders.
So just the same way that we were able to jump over the damaged circuitry in the retina to get to the retina's output cells, we can jump over the damaged circuitry in the cochlea to get the auditory nerve, or jump over damaged areas in the cortex, in the motor cortex, to bridge the gap produced by a stroke.
I just want to end with a simple message that understanding the code is really, really important, and if we can understand the code, the language of the brain, things become possible that didn't seem obviously

Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth.
They've been here for billions of years, and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms.
So they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of DNA.
They have very few genes, and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out.
And the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment, they grow to twice their size, they cut themselves down in the middle, and one cell becomes two, and so on and so on.
They just grow and divide, and grow and divide -- so a kind of boring life, except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters.
I know you guys think of yourself as humans, and this is sort of how I think of you.
This man is supposed to represent a generic human being, and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body.
There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do, but you have 10 trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life.
So, 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being.
And of course it's the DNA that counts, so here's all the A, T, Gs and Cs that make up your genetic code, and give you all your charming characteristics.
You have about 30,000 genes.
Well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life.
At the best, you're 10 percent human, but more likely about one percent human, depending on which of these metrics you like.
I know you think of yourself as human beings, but I think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial.
These bacteria are not passive riders, these are incredibly important, they keep us alive.
They cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy.
They digest our food, they make our vitamins, they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out.
So they do all these amazing things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive, and they never get any press for that.
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well.
So, there's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time, and if they are, they make you incredibly sick.
And so, the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do, or all the bad things that bacteria do.
The question we had is how could they do anything at all?
I mean they're incredibly small, you have to have a microscope to see one.
They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide, and they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms.
And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals.
And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live.
The clue to this came from another marine bacterium, and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri.
What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium, a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean, named Vibrio fischeri.
This bacterium has the special property that it makes light, so it makes bioluminescence, like fireflies make light.
We're not doing anything to the cells here.
We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room, and this is what we see.
What was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light, but when the bacteria made light.
What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone, so when they were in dilute suspension, they made no light.
But when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously.
The question that we had is how can bacteria, these primitive organisms, tell the difference from times when they're alone, and times when they're in a community, and then all do something together.
What we've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other, and they talk with a chemical language.
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell.
When it's alone it doesn't make any light.
But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones, and these are the red triangles, and when the bacteria is alone the molecules just float away and so no light.
But when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules, the molecule -- the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number.
And when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are, they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony.
That's how bioluminescence works -- they're talking with these chemical words.
The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology.
Again, another plug for the animals in the ocean, Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid.
What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid, and it's been turned on its back, and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells, they live in there, at high cell number that molecule is there, and they're making light.
The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light.
The way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii, just in sort of shallow knee-deep water.
The squid is nocturnal, so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps, but then at night it has to come out to hunt.
On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in, since it's just in those couple feet of water.
What the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria.
Then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back.
And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom -- which is made by the bacterium -- exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back, so the squid doesn't make a shadow.
It actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device so predators can't see its shadow, calculate its trajectory, and eat it.
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean.
But then if you think about it, the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that.
And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep, it buries itself in the sand, and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm, and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria.
Now the bacteria are dilute, that little hormone molecule is gone, so they're not making light -- but of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand.
And as the day goes by the bacteria double, they release the molecule, and then light comes on at night, exactly when the squid wants it.
First we figured out how this bacterium does this, but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism.
And what we found -- so this is now supposed to be, again, my bacterial cell -- is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein -- that's the red box -- it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule, the red triangle.
And then as the cells grow, they're all releasing that molecule into the environment, so there's lots of molecule there.
And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule.
These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells.
When the molecule increases to a certain amount -- which says something about the number of cells -- it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light.
Why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous, glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean -- all bacteria have systems like this.
So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other.
They make chemical words, they recognize those words, and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison.
We have a fancy name for this: we call it quorum sensing.
They vote with these chemical votes, the vote gets counted, and then everybody responds to the vote.
What's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions.
But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence.
It's not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins -- you're enormous, that would have no effect on you. You're huge.
What they do, we now understand, is they get in you, they wait, they start growing, they count themselves with these little molecules, and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together, they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host.
Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing.
That's how it works.
We also then went to look at what are these molecules -- these were the red triangles on my slides before.
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule.
This is the word that it talks with.
So then we started to look at other bacteria, and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered.
What I hope you can see is that the molecules are related.
The left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria.
But the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species.
What that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages.
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other.
So these are private, secret conversations.
These conversations are for intraspecies communication.
Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings.
Once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors.
But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves, they live in incredible mixtures, with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria.
And that's depicted on this slide. This is your skin.
So this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin.
Anywhere on your body, it looks pretty much like this, and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there.
And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria, and it's about counting your neighbors, it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species.
There has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population.
So we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria, and what we've found now is that in fact, bacteria are multilingual.
They all have a species-specific system -- they have a molecule that says "me."
But then, running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered, that's generic.
So, they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor, and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria.
It's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication.
What happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you.
They take that information inside, and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population.
Then again we turn to chemistry, and we figured out what this generic molecule is -- that was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.
It's a very small, five-carbon molecule.
What the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule.
So they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication.
This is the bacterial Esperanto.
Once we got that far, we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language.
But what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well.
I've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors, they communicate with these molecules.
Of course, I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing.
We thought, what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear?
Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics?
Of course, you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics.
Bacteria are incredibly multi-drug-resistant right now, and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria.
They either pop the bacterial membrane, they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA.
We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants.
And so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases.
We thought, well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications, just make these bacteria so they can't talk, they can't count, and they don't know to launch virulence.
And so that's exactly what we've done, and we've sort of taken two strategies.
The first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system.
So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules -- which you saw -- but they're a little bit different.
And so they lock into those receptors, and they jam recognition of the real thing.
By targeting the red system, what we are able to do is to make species-specific, or disease-specific, anti-quorum sensing molecules.
We've also done the same thing with the pink system.
We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made antagonists of the interspecies communication system.
The hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria.
To finish I'll just show you the strategy.
In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule, but the logic is exactly the same.
What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal, in this case, a mouse, it doesn't initiate virulence right away.
It gets in, it starts growing, it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules.
It recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack, and the animal dies.
What we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections, but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules -- so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing, but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide.
What we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium -- a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium -- in the same time we give our anti-quorum sensing molecule, in fact, the animal lives.
We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around, at least initially, this big problem of resistance.
What I hope you think, is that bacteria can talk to each other, they use chemicals as their words, they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about.
Of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular.
So in the spirit of TED they're doing things together because it makes a difference.
What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors, and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals.
What I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity.
Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years; humans, couple hundred thousand.
We think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works.
We think, by studying bacteria, we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body.
We know that the principles and the rules, if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms, the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well.
I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other.
By using these two molecules they can say "me" and they can say "you."
Again of course that's what we do, both in a molecular way, and also in an outward way, but I think about the molecular stuff.
This is exactly what happens in your body.
It's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day, and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on, these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is, and what their tasks should be.
Again, we think that bacteria invented that, and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles, but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study.
The final thing is, again just to reiterate that there's this practical part, and so we've made these anti-quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics.
But then, to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the Earth, we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules.
So, we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better.
Remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells in you or on you, keeping you healthy.
What we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you, in the hopes of making you more healthy, making those conversations better, so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own.
Finally, I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton, New Jersey.
Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture.
I hope when you learn things, like about how the natural world works -- I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child.
Science is done by that demographic.
All of those people are between 20 and 30 years old, and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country.
It's a really lucky demographic to work with.
I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age, and it's just a crazy delightful job.
I want to thank you for inviting me here.
It's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference.
Thanks.

It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland, because until a couple of years ago, people knew hardly anything about us, and I could basically come out here and say only good things about us.
But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things.
First, of course, the economic meltdown.
It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay.
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve.
Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends, including President Obama.
By the way, the pronunciation is "Eyjafjallajokull."
None of your media got it right.
But I'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly.
I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital, which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin -- who you see in the picture -- in the spring of 2007, just over a year before the economic collapse hit.
Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm?
Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone.
And I'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country.
But I can surely tell you that in my country, much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere, men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector, and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems.
So we decided, a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable, to found a financial services firm based on our values, and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance.
Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland.
We weren't known as the typical "women" women in Iceland up until then.
So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then.
And we got a great group of people to join us -- principled people with great skills, and investors with a vision and values to match ours.
And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients.
And although I want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that -- and also there's a factor of luck and timing -- we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values.
So let me share with you our values.
We believe in risk awareness.
What does that mean?
We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking, and we will not invest in things we don't understand.
Not a complicated thing.
But in 2007, at the height of the sub-prime and all the complicated financial structures, it was quite opposite to the reckless risk-taking behaviors that we saw on the market.
We also believe in straight-talking, telling it as it is, using simple language that people understand, telling people about the downsides as well as the potential upsides, and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter, like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the Icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us.
And, although we do work in the financial sector, where Excel is king, we believe in emotional capital.
And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence.
It is actually people that make money and lose money, not Excel spreadsheets.
Last, but not least, we believe in profit with principles.
We care how we make our profit.
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers, we are willing to do it with a long-term view, and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter.
So we like to see profits, plus positive social and environmental benefits, when we invest.
But it wasn't just about the values, although we are convinced that they matter.
It was also about a business opportunity.
It's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend, that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come.
The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men; it is actually about women being different from men, bringing different values and different ways to the table.
So what do you get? You get better decision-making, and you get less herd behavior, and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results.
But one has to wonder, now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland -- and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now, and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well.
Now that we've had all that happen, and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables, will we see business and finance change?
Will government change?
Well I'll give you my straight talk about this.
I have days that I believe, but I have days that I'm full of doubt.
Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us?
Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity -- to do the same things over and over again, hoping for a different outcome.
So I guess the world is insane, because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again, hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us.
I want to see more revolutionary thinking, and I remain hopeful.
Like TED, I believe in people.
And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious, and they are going to start voting with their wallets, and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside, if they don't do it from the inside.
But I'm more of the revolutionary, and I should be; I'm from Iceland.
We have a long history of strong, courageous, independent women, ever since the Viking age.
And I want to tell you when I first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society, I was seven -- it happened to be my mother's birthday -- October 24, 1975.
Women in Iceland took the day off.
From work or from home, they took the day off, and nothing worked in Iceland.
They marched into the center of Reykjavik, and they put women's issues onto the agenda.
And some say this was the start of a global movement.
For me it was the start of a long journey, but I decided that day to matter.
Five years later, Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president -- first female to become head of state, single mom, a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed.
And at one of the campaign sessions, she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president -- she was a woman, and even half a woman.
That night she won the election, because she came back -- not just because of his crappy behavior -- but she came back and said, "Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation; I'm going to lead it."
So I've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today.
But in spite of that, I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman.
Started in corporate America, and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual, that women and men would have just the same opportunities.
But I've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that.
We are not the same, and it's great. Because of our differences, we create and sustain life.
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge.
The final thought I want to leave with you is that I'm fed up with this tyranny of either/or choices in life -- either it's men or it's women.
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance.
So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there, and let's start thinking about doing good business.
That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future.
Thank you.

It's very, very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this, because everyone has spoken. Everything has been said.
So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us of some of the things that have gone on here, and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away, and take forward and work on.
That's what I'd like to try and do.
We came here saying we want to talk about "Africa: the Next Chapter."
But we are talking about "Africa: the Next Chapter" because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we're looking at, and saying it's not such a good thing.
The picture I showed you before, and this picture, of drought, death and disease is what we usually see.
What we want to look at is "Africa: the Next Chapter," and that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African.
And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard through the conference right from the first day, where I heard that all the important statistics have been given -- about where we are now, about how the continent is doing much better.
And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.
So I'm not going to spend too much time -- just to show you, refresh your memories that we are here for "Africa: the Next Chapter" because for the first time there really is a platform to build on.
We really do have it going right that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen.
After decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent, and it's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even.
And inflation has come down.
External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent -- has come down dramatically.
You know, as you can see, from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion.
Now this is a huge achievement.
You know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important?
It's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.
We've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference because private investment flows have increased.
I want to remind you again -- I know you saw these statistics before -- from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.
In 2005, remittances -- I just took one country, Nigeria skyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic, but increasing dramatically.
And in many other countries this is happening.
Why is this important? Because it shows confidence.
People are now confident to bring -- if your people in the diaspora bring their money back, it shows other people that, look, there is emerging confidence in your country.
And instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow.
Now, why is all this important, to have to go really fast?
It's important that we build this platform, that we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying, "Look, we must do something different."
Because we are confronted with a challenge.
62 percent of our population is below the age of 24.
What does this mean?
This means that we have to focus on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives.
You have to focus on how to create jobs, make sure they don't fall into disease, and that they get an education.
But most of all that they are productively engaged in life, and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen.
And to support this, I just recently -- one of the things I've done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria.
Most of our countries don't even have any opinion research.
People don't have voice.
There is no way you can know what people want.
One of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue.
Like in every other country where this has been done, jobs is the top issue.
I want to leave this up here and come back to it.
But before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this.
And to say that for me, the next stage of building this platform that now enables us to move forward -- and we mustn't make light of it.
It was only 5, 6, 7 years ago we couldn't even talk about the next chapter, because we were in the old chapter.
We were going nowhere.
The economies were not growing.
We were having negative per capita growth.
The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward was not even there.
So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this, including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.
Creating our own program to solve problems, like fighting corruption, building institutions, stabilizing the micro economy.
So now we have this platform we can build on.
And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here: aid versus private sector, aid versus trade, etc.
And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things is that it's been a simplistic debate.
And that's not what the debate should be about.
That's engaging in the wrong debate.
The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors, the private sector and ordinary African people taking charge of their own lives?
How do we combine all this?
To move our continent forward, to do the things that need doing that I talked about -- getting young people employed.
Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent, much of what you have seen here.
So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate.
We need to bring it back to say, what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want?
And I want to tell you something.
For me, the issue about aid -- I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid.
Africa has been giving the other countries aid.
Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid.
And I said, "Mo, you're right. We have -- no, but we've already been doing it!
The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid."
It is all the resources that were taken from Africa, including human, that built these countries today!
So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.
The issue is not that.
The issue is how are we using what has been given back.
How are we using it?
Is it being directed effectively?
I want to tell you a little story.
Why I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well.
From 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria-Biafra war.
And in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old.
We spent much of our time with my mother cooking.
For the army -- my father joined the army as a brigadier -- the Biafran army.
We were on the Biafran side.
And we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place, but wherever we could help we did.
At a certain point in time, in 1969, things were really bad.
We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day.
People, children were dying of kwashiorkor.
I'm sure some of you who are not so young will remember those pictures.
Well, I was in the middle of it.
In the midst of all this, my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days.
We thought she was going to die.
My father was not there.
He was in the army.
So I was the oldest person in the house.
My sister fell very ill with malaria.
She was three years old and I was 15.
And she had such a high fever. We tried everything.
It didn't look like it was going to work.
Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was looking at people and giving them meds.
Now I put my sister on my back -- burning -- and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back.
It was really hot. I was very hungry.
I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.
We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.
I walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.
I got there and I saw huge crowds.
Almost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door.
She was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in?
I had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back, find a way to a window.
And while they were trying to break down the door, I climbed in through the window, and jumped in.
This woman told me it was in the nick of time.
By the time we jumped into that hall, she was barely moving.
She gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then -- gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration -- and some other therapies, and put us in a corner.
In about two to three hours, she started to move.
And then they toweled her down because she started sweating, which was a good sign.
And then my sister woke up.
And about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.
I strapped her on my back.
I walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had.
I was so happy -- -- that my sister was alive!
Today she's 41 years old, a mother of three, and she's a physician saving other lives.
Why am I telling that? I'm telling you that because -- when it is you or your person involved -- you don't care where -- whether it's aid.
You don't care what it is!
You just want the person to be alive!
And now let me become less sentimental, and say that saving lives -- which some of the aid we get does on this continent -- when you save the life of anyone, a farmer, a teacher, a mother, they are contributing productively into the economy.
And as an economist, we can also look at that side of the story.
These are people who are productive agents in the economy.
So if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria, it means they can form the base of production for our economy.
And by the same token -- as someone said yesterday -- if we don't and they die, their children will become a burden on the economy.
So even from an economic standpoint, if we leave the social and the humanitarian, we need to save lives now.
So that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I say let's channel these resources we get into something productive.
However, I will also tell you that I'm one of those who doesn't believe that this is the sole answer.
That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated.
You know, we have to use it well.
What has happened in Europe?
Do you all know that Spain -- part of the EU -- got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU?
Resources that were transferred to them -- and were the Spanish ashamed of this? No!
The EU transferred 10 billion. Where did they use it?
Have you been to southern Spain lately? There are roads everywhere.
Infrastructure everywhere.
It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain has developed into a services economy.
Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid?
Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today.
For which many people, even from other parts of the world, are going there to find jobs.
What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid?
They used it to build an information superhighway, gain infrastructure that enables them to participate in the information technology revolution, and to create jobs in their economy.
They didn't say, "No, you know, we're not going to take this."
Today, the European Union is busy transferring aid.
My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain -- which is roads, highways, other things that they can build -- I say then, why do they refuse to use the same aid to build the same infrastructure in our countries?
When we ask them and tell them what we need, one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.
Now we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all that and the EU.
We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money -- some of them in this audience, with private foundations.
And one day, these foundations have so much money, they will overtake the official aid that is being given.
But I fear -- and I'm very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent -- but I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my belly because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent.
And they're also going from country to country, and many times trying to find what to do.
But I'm not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way.
And many of them are not really familiar with the continent.
They are just discovering.
And many times I don't see Africans working with them.
They are just going alone!
And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from Africans who might know.
They want to visit us, see what's happening on the ground and make a decision.
And now I'm maybe being harsh.
But I worry because this money is so important.
Now, who are they accountable to?
Are we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money? Are we there?
Will we make the same mistake that we made before?
Have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about -- have they ever called these people together and said, "Look, your foundation and your foundation -- you have so much money, we are grateful.
Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this aid should go."
Have we done that? The answer is no.
And each one is making their own individual effort.
And then 10 years from now, billions will again have gone into Africa, and we would still have the same problems.
This is what gives us the hopeless image.
Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money, "Sit down."
And we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate.
We've not called the Bill Gates, and the Soros, and everybody else who is helping and say, "Sit down. Let's have a conference with you.
As a continent, here are our priorities.
Here is where we want you to channel this money."
Each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best.
We're not trying to stop them at all! But to help them help us better.
And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this.
Ten years from now we will have the same story, and we will be repeating the same things.
So our problem right now is, how can we leverage all this good will that is coming towards our way?
How can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations, with the international organizations, and with our private sector.
I firmly believe in that private sector thing too.
But it cannot do it alone.
So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work.
They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas.
So why don't we think of using some of this aid?
Well, why don't we first say to those helping us out, "Don't be shy about infrastructure.
That health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure.
That education will work better if we've got electricity and railroads, and so on.
That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market.
Don't be shy of it.
Invest some of your resources in that, too."
And then we can see that this is one combination of private, international, multilateral money, private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership, so that aid can be a facilitator.
That is all aid can be.
Aid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that.
But it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic, we would have failed.
One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now -- one of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources.
It's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese.
If you tell them, "We need a road here," they will help you build it.
They don't shy away from infrastructure.
In fact, the Chinese minister of finance said to me, when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria.
He said, "There are two things you need only.
Infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.
You are undisciplined."
And I repeat it for the continent.
It's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.
So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.
Now I realize -- I'm not saying -- health and education -- no, you can also provide that as well.
But I'm saying it's not either or.
Let's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership.
One idea.
Second thing, for the private sector, people are afraid to take risks on the continent.
Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms, to enable people to take risk?
And finally, because they are both standing at my -- I'm out of time.
Am I out of time?
OK, so let me not forget my punchline.
One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is to support women, to create jobs.
A lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it.
But there are people -- women -- creating jobs.
And we know, studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman -- in fact, there's an econometric study, the World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that transfers into the hands of women result in healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.
So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here -- I'm not saying the men are not important -- obviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do?
They'll come back home and get disgruntled, and it will result in difficulties we don't want.
We don't want men beating their wives because they don't have a job, and so on.
But at the margin, we also -- I want to push this, because the reason is the men automatically -- they get -- not automatically, but they tend to get more support.
But I want you to realize that resources in the hands of African women is a powerful tool.
There are people creating jobs.
Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.
We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company.
She wants to expand.
She needs another 20 million.
She will create another 100, 200 more jobs.
So take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are ready -- business people who want to expand and create more jobs.
And lastly, what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid, government, private sector and the African as an individual?
Thank you.

Up until now, our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms.
Whether it's something simple like turning on the lights with a switch, or even as complex as programming robotics, we have always had to give a command to a machine, or even a series of commands, in order for it to do something for us.
Communication between people, on the other hand, is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed.
We observe facial expressions, body language, and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another.
This actually forms a large part of our decision-making process.
Our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction into human-computer interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do, but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences.
And what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain, our center for control and experience.
Well, it sounds like a pretty good idea, but this task, as Bruno mentioned, isn't an easy one for two main reasons: First, the detection algorithms.
Our brain is made up of billions of active neurons, around 170,000 km of combined axon length.
When these neurons interact, the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse, which can be measured.
The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain, and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity, the brain surface is highly folded.
Now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses.
Each individual's cortex is folded differently, very much like a fingerprint.
So even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain, by the time the structure has been folded, its physical location is very different between individuals, even identical twins.
There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals.
Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex, so that we can map the signals closer to its source, and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population.
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves.
EEG measurements typically involve a hairnet with an array of sensors, like the one that you can see here in the photo.
A technician will put the electrodes onto the scalp using a conductive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp by light abrasion.
Now this is quite time consuming and isn't the most comfortable process.
And on top of that, these systems actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.
So with that, I'd like to invite onstage Evan Grant, who is one of last year's speakers, who's kindly agreed to help me to demonstrate what we've been able to develop.
So the device that you see is a 14-channel, high-fidelity EEG acquisition system.
It doesn't require any scalp preparation, no conductive gel or paste.
It only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle.
It's also wireless, so it gives you the freedom to move around.
And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional EEG system, this headset only costs a few hundred dollars.
Now on to the detection algorithms.
So facial expressions -- as I mentioned before in emotional experiences -- are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for personalization.
But with the limited time we have available, I'd like to show you the cognitive suite, which is the ability for you to basically move virtual objects with your mind.
Now, Evan is new to this system, so what we have to do first is create a new profile for him.
He's obviously not Joanne -- so we'll "add user."
Evan. Okay.
So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal.
With neutral, there's nothing in particular that Evan needs to do.
He just hangs out. He's relaxed.
And the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain, because every brain is different.
It takes eight seconds to do this, and now that that's done, we can choose a movement-based action.
So Evan, choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind.
Evan Grant: Let's do "pull."
Tan Le: Okay, so let's choose "pull."
So the idea here now is that Evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen, and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that.
The first time, nothing will happen, because the system has no idea how he thinks about "pull."
But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds.
So: one, two, three, go.
Okay.
So once we accept this, the cube is live.
So let's see if Evan can actually try and imagine pulling.
Ah, good job!
That's really amazing.
So we have a little bit of time available, so I'm going to ask Evan to do a really difficult task.
And this one is difficult because it's all about being able to visualize something that doesn't exist in our physical world.
This is "disappear."
So what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions, we do that all the time, so you can visualize it.
But with "disappear," there's really no analogies -- so Evan, what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out, okay.
Same sort of drill. So: one, two, three, go.
Okay. Let's try that.
Oh, my goodness. He's just too good.
Let's try that again.
EG: Losing concentration.
TL: But we can see that it actually works, even though you can only hold it for a little bit of time.
As I said, it's a very difficult process to imagine this.
And the great thing about it is that we've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about "disappear."
As there is a machine learning algorithm in this -- Thank you.
Good job. Good job.
Thank you, Evan, you're a wonderful, wonderful example of the technology.
So, as you can see, before, there is a leveling system built into this software so that as Evan, or any user, becomes more familiar with the system, they can continue to add more and more detections, so that the system begins to differentiate between different distinct thoughts.
And once you've trained up the detections, these thoughts can be assigned or mapped to any computing platform, application or device.
So I'd like to show you a few examples, because there are many possible applications for this new interface.
In games and virtual worlds, for example, your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character.
Obviously, you can experience the fantasy of magic and control the world with your mind.
And also, colors, lighting, sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you're having, in real time.
And moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world, with robots and simple machines, for example -- in this case, flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking "lift" with your mind.
The technology can also be applied to real world applications -- in this example, a smart home.
You know, from the user interface of the control system to opening curtains or closing curtains.
And of course, also to the lighting -- turning them on or off.
And finally, to real life-changing applications, such as being able to control an electric wheelchair.
In this example, facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands.
Now blink right to go right.
Now blink left to turn back left.
Now smile to go straight.
TL: We really -- Thank you.
We are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today, and with the community's input, and also with the involvement of developers and researchers from around the world, we hope that you can help us to shape where the technology goes from here. Thank you so much.

Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone.
You know that all over the world, people fight for their freedom, fight for their rights.
Some battle oppressive governments.
Others battle oppressive societies.
Which battle do you think is harder?
Allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes.
Let me take you back two years ago in my life.
It was the bedtime of my son, Aboody.
He was five at the time.
After finishing his bedtime rituals, he looked at me and he asked a question: "Mommy, are we bad people?"
I was shocked.
"Why do you say such things, Aboody?"
Earlier that day, I noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school.
He wouldn't tell me what happened.
[But now] he was ready to tell.
"Two boys hit me today in school.
They told me, 'We saw your mom on Facebook.
You and your mom should be put in jail.'" I've never been afraid to tell Aboody anything.
I've been always a proud woman of my achievements.
But those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth, when it all came together.
You see, I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars.
Just for giving me his car keys, my own brother was detained twice, and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist, leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son.
My father had to sit in a Friday sermon listening to the imam condemning women drivers and calling them prostitutes amongst tons of worshippers, some of them our friends and family of my own father.
I was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared in family gatherings, in the streets and in schools.
It all hit me.
It came into focus that those kids did not mean to be rude to my son.
They were just influenced by the adults around them.
And it wasn't about me, and it wasn't a punishment for taking the wheel and driving a few miles.
It was a punishment for daring to challenge the society's rules.
But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine.
Allow me to give you a briefing about my story.
It was May, 2011, and I was complaining to a work colleague about the harassments I had to face trying to find a ride back home, although I have a car and an international driver's license.
As long as I've known, women in Saudi Arabia have been always complaining about the ban, but it's been 20 years since anyone tried to do anything about it, a whole generation ago.
He broke the good/bad news in my face.
"But there is no law banning you from driving."
I looked it up, and he was right.
There wasn't an actual law in Saudi Arabia.
It was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women.
That realization ignited the idea of June 17, where we encouraged women to take the wheel and go drive.
It was a few weeks later, we started receiving all these "Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive."
A courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri, she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah, she drove a car and she announced but she didn't record a video.
We needed proof.
So I drove. I posted a video on YouTube.
And to my surprise, it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day.
What happened next, of course?
I started receiving threats to be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign.
The Saudi authorities remained very quiet.
That really creeped us out.
I was in the campaign with other Saudi women and even men activists.
We wanted to know how the authorities would respond on the actual day, June 17, when women go out and drive.
So this time I asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car.
It went fast. We were arrested, signed a pledge not to drive again, released.
Arrested again, he was sent to detention for one day, and I was sent to jail.
I wasn't sure why I was sent there, because I didn't face any charges in the interrogation.
But what I was sure of was my innocence.
I didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya — it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house — and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off, but I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying, "No, I'm leaving today."
Outside the jail, the whole country went into a frenzy, some attacking me badly, and others supportive and even collecting signatures in a petition to be sent to the king to release me.
I was released after nine days.
June 17 comes.
The streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars, but some hundred brave Saudi women broke the ban and drove that day.
None were arrested. We broke the taboo.
So I think by now, everyone knows that we can't drive, or women are not allowed to drive, in Saudi Arabia, but maybe few know why.
Allow me to help you answer this question.
There was this official study that was presented to the Shura Council -- it's the consultative council appointed by the king in Saudi Arabia — and it was done by a local professor, a university professor.
He claims it's done based on a UNESCO study.
And the study states, the percentage of rape, adultery, illegitimate children, even drug abuse, prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don't drive.
I know, I was like this, I was shocked.
I was like, "We are the last country in the world where women don't drive."
So if you look at the map of the world, that only leaves two countries: Saudi Arabia, and the other society is the rest of the world.
We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study, and it made headlines around the world.
[BBC News: 'End of virginity' if women drive, Saudi cleric warns] And only then we realized it's so empowering to mock your oppressor.
It strips it away of its strongest weapon: fear.
This system is based on ultra-conservative traditions and customs that deal with women as if they are inferior and they need a guardian to protect them, so they need to take permission from this guardian, whether verbal or written, all their lives.
We are minors until the day we die.
And it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law, or the religious laws.
What's worst, when they become codified as laws in the system, and when women themselves believe in their inferiority, and they even fight those who try to question these rules.
So for me, it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face.
It was about living two totally different perceptions of my personality, of my person -- the villain back in my home country, and the hero outside.
Just to tell you, two stories happened in the last two years.
One of them is when I was in jail.
I'm pretty sure when I was in jail, everyone saw titles in the international media something like this during these nine days I was in jail.
But in my home country, it was a totally different picture.
It was more like this: "Manal al-Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order and inciting women to drive."
I know.
"Manal al-Sharif withdraws from the campaign."
Ah, it's okay. This is my favorite.
"Manal al-Sharif breaks down and confesses: 'Foreign forces incited me.'" And it goes on, even trial and flogging me in public.
So it's a totally different picture.
I was asked last year to give a speech at the Oslo Freedom Forum.
I was surrounded by this love and the support of people around me, and they looked at me as an inspiration.
At the same time, I flew back to my home country, they hated that speech so much.
The way they called it: a betrayal to the Saudi country and the Saudi people, and they even started a hashtag called #OsloTraitor on Twitter.
Some 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag, while the opposite hashtag, #OsloHero, there was like a handful of tweets written.
They even started a poll.
More than 13,000 voters answered this poll: whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech.
Ninety percent said yes, she's a traitor.
So it's these two totally different perceptions of my personality.
For me, I'm a proud Saudi woman, and I do love my country, and because I love my country, I'm doing this.
Because I believe a society will not be free if the women of that society are not free.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you.
I learned to be always there.
The first thing, I got out of jail, of course after I took a shower, I went online, I opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page, and I've been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me.
I would listen to what they say, and I would never defend myself with words only.
I would use actions. When they said I should withdraw from the campaign, I filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate of traffic police for not issuing me a driver's license.
There are a lot of people also -- very big support, like those 3,000 people who signed the petition to release me.
We sent a petition to the Shura Council in favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women, and there were, like, 3,500 citizens who believed in that and they signed that petition.
There were people like that, I just showed some examples, who are amazing, who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia, and trying, and they are also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views.
Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women's rights.
The Shura Council that's appointed by the king, by royal decree of King Abdullah, last year there were 30 women assigned to that Council, like 20 percent.
20 percent of the Council.
The same time, finally, that Council, after rejecting our petition four times for women driving, they finally accepted it last February.
After being sent to jail or sentenced lashing, or sent to a trial, the spokesperson of the traffic police said, we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers.
The Grand Mufti, who is the head of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia, he said, it's not recommended for women to drive.
It used to be haram, forbidden, by the previous Grand Mufti.
So for me, it's not about only these small steps.
It's about women themselves.
A friend once asked me, she said, "So when do you think this women driving will happen?"
I told her, "Only if women stop asking 'When?' and take action to make it now."
So it's not only about the system, it's also about us women to drive our own life, I'd say.
So I have no clue, really, how I became an activist.
And I don't know how I became one now.
But all I know, and all I'm sure of, in the future when someone asks me my story, I will say, "I'm proud to be amongst those women who lifted the ban, fought the ban, and celebrated everyone's freedom."
So the question I started my talk with, who do you think is more difficult to face, oppressive governments or oppressive societies?
I hope you find clues to answer that from my speech.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.
Thank you.

You may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins, and I promise I will come back to those virgins.
But in fact, here in the northwest, we're living very close to the real Koranic idea of paradise, defined 36 times as "gardens watered by running streams."
Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union, this makes perfect sense to me.
But the thing is, how come it's news to most people?
I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims who've begun reading the Koran, but given up, disconcerted by its "otherness."
The historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes, yet even he called the Koran "as toilsome reading as I ever undertook, a wearisome, confused jumble."
Part of the problem, I think, is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book -- as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach, as though God -- and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad -- were just another author on the bestseller list.
Yet the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it's so easy to quote -- that is, to misquote.
Phrases and snippets taken out of context in what I call the "highlighter version," which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists and anti-Muslim Islamophobes.
So this past spring, as I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad, I realized I needed to read the Koran properly -- as properly as I could, that is.
My Arabic's reduced by now to wielding a dictionary, so I took four well-known translations and decided to read them side-by-side, verse-by-verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh-century Arabic.
Now I did have an advantage.
My last book was about the story behind the Shi'a-Sunni split, and for that I'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories, so I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers, its frame of reference.
I knew enough, that is, to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran -- an informed one, an experienced one even, but still an outsider, an agnostic Jew reading some else's holy book.
So I read slowly.
I'd set aside three weeks for this project, and that, I think, is what is meant by "hubris" -- -- because it turned out to be three months.
I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are.
But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran -- that feeling of "I get it now" -- it would slip away overnight, and I'd come back in the morning wondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land, and yet the terrain was very familiar.
The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels.
So one-third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures like Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus.
God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh -- jealously insisting on no other gods.
The presence of camels, mountains, desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert.
And then there was the language, the rhythmic cadence of it, reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders recite hours-long narrative poems entirely from memory.
And I began to grasp why it's said that the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic.
Take the Fatihah, the seven-verse opening chapter that is the Lord's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined.
It's just 29 words in Arabic, but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation.
And yet the more you add, the more seems to go missing.
The Arabic has an incantatory, almost hypnotic, quality that begs to be heard rather than read, felt more than analyzed.
It wants to be chanted out loud, to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue.
So the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself, or as Arthur Arberry called his version, "an interpretation."
But all is not lost in translation.
As the Koran promises, patience is rewarded, and there are many surprises -- a degree of environmental awareness, for instance, and of humans as mere stewards of God's creation, unmatched in the Bible.
And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men, using the second and third person masculine, the Koran includes women -- talking, for instance, of believing men and believing women, honorable men and honorable women.
Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers.
Yes, it does say that, but in a very specific context: the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca where fighting was usually forbidden, and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers.
Not "You must kill unbelievers in Mecca," but you can, you are allowed to, but only after a grace period is over and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba, and only if they attack you first.
And even then -- God is merciful; forgiveness is supreme -- and so, essentially, better if you don't.
This was perhaps the biggest surprise -- how flexible the Koran is, at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible.
"Some of these verses are definite in meaning," it says, "and others are ambiguous."
The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities, trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own.
Only God knows the true meaning.
The phrase "God is subtle" appears again and again, and indeed, the whole of the Koran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe.
As in, for instance, that little matter of virgins and paradise.
Old-fashioned Orientalism comes into play here.
The word used four times is Houris, rendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts, or as fair, high-bosomed virgins.
Yet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word: Houris.
Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight.
Now this may be a way of saying "pure beings" -- like in angels -- or it may be like the Greek Kouros or Kórē, an eternal youth.
But the truth is nobody really knows, and that's the point.
Because the Koran is quite clear when it says that you'll be "a new creation in paradise" and that you will be "recreated in a form unknown to you," which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin.
And that number 72 never appears.
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran.
That idea only came into being 300 years later, and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps.
Paradise is quite the opposite.
It's not virginity; it's fecundity.
It's plenty.

<title>Lesley Hazleton: On reading the Koran</title>
<description>Lesley Hazleton sat down one day to read the Koran. And what she found -- as a non-Muslim, a self-identified "tourist" in the Islamic holy book -- wasn't what she expected. With serious scholarship and warm humor, Hazleton shares the grace, flexibility and mystery she found, in this myth-debunking talk. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

I study ants, and that's because I like to think about how organizations work.
And in particular, how the simple parts of organizations interact to create the behavior of the whole organization.
So, ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that, and there are many others. The web is one.
There are many biological systems like that -- brains, cells, developing embryos.
There are about 10,000 species of ants.
They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens, and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers.
And all ant colonies have in common that there's no central control.
Nobody tells anybody what to do.
The queen just lays the eggs. There's no management.
No ant directs the behavior of any other ant.
And I try to figure out how that works.
And I've been working for the past 20 years on a population of seed-eating ants in southeastern Arizona.
Here's my study site. This is really a picture of ants, and the rabbit just happens to be there.
And these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds.
This is the nest of the mature colony, and there's the nest entrance.
And they forage maybe for about 20 meters away, gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest, and store them.
And every year I go there and make a map of my study site.
This is just a road. And it's not very big: it's about 250 meters on one side, 400 on the other.
And every colony has a name, which is a number, which is painted on a rock. And I go there every year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before, and figure out which ones have died, and put all the new ones on the map.
And by doing this I know how old they all are.
And because of that, I've been able to study how their behavior changes as the colony gets older and larger.
So I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony.
Ants never make more ants; colonies make more colonies.
And they do that by each year sending out the reproductives -- those are the ones with wings -- on a mating flight.
So every year, on the same day -- and it's a mystery exactly how that happens -- each colony sends out its virgin, unmated queens with wings, and the males, and they all fly to a common place. And they mate.
And this shows a recently virgin queen. Here's her wings.
And she's in the process of mating with this male, and there's another male on top waiting his turn.
Often the queens mate more than once.
And after that, the males all die. That's it for them.
And then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere, drop their wings, dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs.
And they will live for 15 or 20 years, continuing to lay eggs using the sperm from that original mating.
So the queen goes down in there.
She lays eggs, she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg, then it's a larva.
She feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves.
Then, as soon as the ants -- the first group of ants -- emerge, they're larvae. Then they're pupae. Then they come out as adult ants.
They go out, they get the food, they dig the nest, and the queen never comes out again.
So this is a one-year-old colony -- this happens to be 536.
There's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.
So this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer.
This is a three-year-old colony.
There's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.
They make a midden, a pile of refuse -- mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat.
This is a five-year-old colony. This is the nest entrance, here's a pencil for scale.
This is about as big as they get, about a meter across.
And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes -- so this is about 10,000 worker ants -- changes as a function of colony age, in years.
So it starts out with zero ants, just the founding queen, and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five.
And it stays that size until the queen dies and there's nobody to make more ants, when she's about 15 or 20 years old.
And it's when they reach this stable size, in numbers of ants, that they start to reproduce.
That is, to send more winged queens and males to that year's mating flight.
And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age because I've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants.
So that's not the most fun part of this research, although it's interesting.
Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation.
That's not just how is the colony organized, but how does it change what it's doing?
How is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change?
So, things happen to an ant colony.
When it rains in the summer, it floods in the desert.
There's a lot of damage to the nest, and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess.
When extra food becomes available -- and this is what everybody knows about picnics -- then extra ants are allocated to collect the food.
So, with nobody telling anybody what to do, how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task?
And that's the process that I call task allocation.
And in harvester ants, I divide the tasks of the ants I see just outside the nest into these four categories: where an ant is foraging, when it's out along the foraging trail, searching for food or bringing food back.
The patrollers -- that's supposed to be a magnifying glass -- are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active.
They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go, and by coming back -- just by making it back -- they tell the foragers that it's safe to go out.
Then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest, and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishman's house.
That is, that there are chambers inside, they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it.
It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings of the Hopi people that are in that area.
And the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest, and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles.
So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand, put it down, turn around, and go back in.
And finally, the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage.
So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse.
On one day, it'll all be here, and then the next day they'll move it over there, and then they'll move it back.
So that's what the midden workers do.
And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest.
So that's only about 25 percent of the colony, and they're the oldest ants.
So, an ant starts out somewhere near the queen.
And when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep as the colony is wide, so about a meter deep for the big old nests.
And then there's another long tunnel and a chamber, where we often find the queen, after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes.
I don't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes, but instead because when there's flooding, occasionally the colony has to go down deep.
So there's this whole network of chambers.
The queen's in there somewhere; she just lays eggs.
There's the larvae, and they consume most of the food.
And this is true of most ants -- that the ants you see walking around don't do much eating.
They bring it back and feed it to the larvae.
When the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber, and other ants come up from below, get the food, bring it back, husk the seeds, and pile them up.
There are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest.
And curiously, and interestingly, it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing.
So, despite what it says in the Bible, about, you know, "Look to the ant, thou sluggard," in fact, you could think of those ants as reserves.
That is to say, if something happened -- and I've never seen anything like this happen, but I've only been looking for 20 years -- if something happened, they might all come out if they were needed.
But in fact, mostly they're just hanging around in there.
And I think it's a very interesting question -- what is there about the way the colony is organized that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing?
And they sort of stand as a buffer in between the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside.
And if you mark ants that are working outside, and dig up a colony, you never see them deep down.
So what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger.
They somehow get into this reserve.
And then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce.
And once they belong to the ants that work outside, they never go back down.
Now ants -- most ants, including these, don't see very well.
They have eyes, they can distinguish between light and dark, but they mostly work by smell.
So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true -- you know, even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do, there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest.
So that's one way that we know the queen isn't directing the behavior of the colony.
So when I first set out to work on task allocation, my first question was, "What's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks?
Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing?
Does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing?"
And I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant was somehow dedicated to its task from birth and sort of performed independently of the others, knowing its place on the assembly line.
And instead I wanted to ask, "How are the different task groups interdependent?"
So I did experiments where I changed one thing.
So for example, I created more work for the nest maintenance workers by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance, early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active.
This is what it looks like about 20 minutes later.
Here it is about 40 minutes later.
And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there.
And what I wanted to know was, "OK, here's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited -- is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks?"
Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked.
So here's some blue nest maintenance workers.
And lately we've gotten more sophisticated and we have this three-color system.
And we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which.
We started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers, and they work really well.
And so just to summarize the result, well it turns out that yes, the different tasks are interdependent.
So, if I change the numbers performing one task, it changes the numbers performing another.
So for example, if I make a mess that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up, then I see fewer ants out foraging.
And this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks.
And the second result, which was surprising to a lot of people, was that ants actually switch tasks.
The same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life.
So for example, if I put out extra food, everybody else -- the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food, they become foragers.
The nest maintenance workers become foragers.
The patrollers become foragers.
But not every transition is possible. And this shows how it works.
Like I just said, if there is more food to collect, the patrollers, the midden workers, the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage.
If there's more patrolling to do -- so I created a disturbance, so extra patrollers were needed -- the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol.
But if more nest maintenance work is needed -- for example, if I put out a bunch of toothpicks -- then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance, they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest.
So foraging acts as a sink, and the ants inside the nest act as a source.
And finally, it looks like each ant is deciding moment to moment whether to be active or not.
So, for example, when there's extra nest maintenance work to do, it's not that the foragers switch over. I know that they don't do that.
But the foragers somehow decide not to come out.
And here was the most intriguing result: the task allocation.
This process changes with colony age, and it changes like this.
When I do these experiments with older colonies -- so ones that are five years or older -- they're much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic. The worse things get, the more I hassle them, the more they act like undisturbed colonies.
Whereas the young, small colonies -- the two-year-old colonies of just 2,000 ants -- are much more variable.
And the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year.
It could be this year, or this year.
So, the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the younger colony.
It's not due to the experience of older, wiser ants.
Instead, something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older.
And the obvious thing that's changing is its size.
So since I've had this result, I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what kinds of decision rules -- very simple, local, probably olfactory, chemical rules could an ant could be using, since no ant can assess the global situation -- that would have the outcome that I see, these predictable dynamics, in who does what task.
And it would change as the colony gets larger.
And what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact.
So anybody who's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae.
They smell with their antennae.
When one ant touches another, it's smelling it, and it can tell, for example, whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants cover themselves and each other, through grooming, with a layer of grease, which carries a colony-specific odor.
And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts, the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks, in deciding what to do.
And so what the message is, is not any message that they transmit from one ant to another, but the pattern.
The pattern itself is the message.
And I'll tell you a little bit more about that.
But first you might be wondering: how is it that an ant can tell, for example, I'm a forager.
I expect to meet another forager every so often.
But if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers, I'm less likely to forage.
So it has to know the difference between a forager and a nest maintenance worker.
And we've learned that, in this species -- and I suspect in others as well -- these hydrocarbons, this layer of grease on the outside of ants, is different as ants perform different tasks.
And we've done experiments that show that that's because the longer an ant stays outside, the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change, and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks.
And they can use that task-specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons -- they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow keep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks.
And we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads, and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate.
And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it, as they would to contact with real ants.
So I want now to show you a bit of film -- and this will start out, first of all, showing you the nest entrance.
So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance.
They've gone out to do different tasks, and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines, or influences, each ant's decision about whether to go out, and which task to perform.
This is taken through a fiber optics microscope. It's down inside the nest.
In the beginning you see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope.
But the idea is that the ants are in there, and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it -- a stream of contacts with other ants.
And the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out, and what it does when it comes back out.
You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these.
Each ant, then, as it comes back in, is contacting other ants.
And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip, are contacting the ants coming in.
So, what's interesting about this system is that it's messy.
It's variable. It's noisy. And, in particular, in two ways.
The first is that the experience of the ant -- of each ant -- can't be very predictable.
Because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside.
And the second thing is that an ant's ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting.
So, we do a lot of simulation and modeling, and also experimental work, to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to, in the aggregate, produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies.
Again, I don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork.
In fact, if you watch ants at all, you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it.
So it's not really that out of these haphazard contacts, perfection arises.
But it works pretty well.
Ants have been around for several hundred million years.
They cover the earth, except for Antarctica.
Something that they're doing is clearly successful enough that this pattern of haphazard contacts, in the aggregate, produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants.
And one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns -- this network of interaction patterns -- to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies.
So the one thing, though, that I want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that you'd expect to be closely connected to colony size.
The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony -- and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule, like "I expect to meet another forager every three seconds."
But in a small colony, it's likely to meet fewer foragers, just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet.
So this is the kind of rule that, as the colony develops and gets older and larger, will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one.
Thank you.

<title>Deborah Gordon: The emergent genius of ant colonies</title>
<description>With a dusty backhoe, a handful of Japanese paint markers and a few students in tow, Deborah Gordon digs up ant colonies in the Arizona desert to understand their complex social system.</description>
<keywords>Featured,ants,biology,collaboration,design,insects,science</keywords>

In Oxford in the 1950s, there was a fantastic doctor, who was very unusual, named Alice Stewart.
And Alice was unusual partly because, of course, she was a woman, which was pretty rare in the 1950s.
And she was brilliant, she was one of the, at the time, the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians.
She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married, after she had kids, and even after she got divorced and was a single parent, she continued her medical work.
And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science, the emerging field of epidemiology, the study of patterns in disease.
But like every scientist, she appreciated that to make her mark, what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it.
The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers.
Most disease is correlated with poverty, but in the case of childhood cancers, the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families.
So, what, she wanted to know, could explain this anomaly?
Now, Alice had trouble getting funding for her research.
In the end, she got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize.
And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data.
Now, she had no idea what to look for.
This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search, so she asked everything she could think of.
Had the children eaten boiled sweets?
Had they consumed colored drinks?
Did they eat fish and chips?
Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing?
What time of life had they started school?
And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back, one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of.
the children who had died had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant.
Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom.
Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point, a threshold.
It flew in the face of conventional wisdom, which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age, which was the X-ray machine.
And it flew in the face of doctors' idea of themselves, which was as people who helped patients, they didn't harm them.
Nevertheless, Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956.
People got very excited, there was talk of the Nobel Prize, and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared.
In fact, she need not have hurried.
It was fully 25 years before the British and medical -- British and American medical establishments abandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women.
The data was out there, it was open, it was freely available, but nobody wanted to know.
A child a week was dying, but nothing changed.
Openness alone can't drive change.
So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands.
So, how did she know that she was right?
Well, she had a fantastic model for thinking.
She worked with a statistician named George Kneale, and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn't.
So, Alice was very outgoing and sociable, and George was a recluse.
Alice was very warm, very empathetic with her patients.
George frankly preferred numbers to people.
But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship.
He said, "My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong."
He actively sought disconfirmation.
Different ways of looking at her models, at her statistics, different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her.
He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories.
Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong, that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right.
It's a fantastic model of collaboration -- thinking partners who aren't echo chambers.
I wonder how many of us have, or dare to have, such collaborators.
Alice and George were very good at conflict.
They saw it as thinking.
So what does that kind of constructive conflict require?
Well, first of all, it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves.
That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive, which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves, and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds, different disciplines, different ways of thinking and different experience, and find ways to engage with them.
That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy.
And the more I've thought about this, the more I think, really, that that's a kind of love.
Because you simply won't commit that kind of energy and time if you don't really care.
And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds.
Alice's daughter told me that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist, they made her think and think and think again.
"My mother," she said, "My mother didn't enjoy a fight, but she was really good at them."
So it's one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship.
But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face, many of the biggest disasters that we've experienced, mostly haven't come from individuals, they've come from organizations, some of them bigger than countries, many of them capable of affecting hundreds, thousands, even millions of lives.
So how do organizations think?
Well, for the most part, they don't.
And that isn't because they don't want to, it's really because they can't.
And they can't because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict.
In surveys of European and American executives, fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise.
Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke, afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage, and felt that they were bound to lose.
Eighty-five percent is a really big number.
It means that organizations mostly can't do what George and Alice so triumphantly did.
They can't think together.
And it means that people like many of us, who have run organizations, and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can, mostly fail to get the best out of them.
So how do we develop the skills that we need?
Because it does take skill and practice, too.
If we aren't going to be afraid of conflict, we have to see it as thinking, and then we have to get really good at it.
So, recently, I worked with an executive named Joe, and Joe worked for a medical device company.
And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on.
He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people.
He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help.
But when he looked around his organization, nobody else seemed to be at all worried.
So, he didn't really want to say anything.
After all, maybe they knew something he didn't.
Maybe he'd look stupid.
But he kept worrying about it, and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved.
In the end, Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns.
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation.
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts.
So now Joe had allies. They could think together.
And yes, there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument, but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative, to solve the problem, and to change the device.
Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle-blower, except that like almost all whistle-blowers, he wasn't a crank at all, he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served.
But he had been so afraid of conflict, until finally he became more afraid of the silence.
And when he dared to speak, he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined.
And his colleagues don't think of him as a crank.
They think of him as a leader.
So, how do we have these conversations more easily and more often?
Well, the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they're prepared to defend.
It doesn't really matter what the statements are about, what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority.
I think it's a fantastic system, but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people, and way too late in life.
I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development, if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society.
The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we've witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden.
It comes from information that is freely available and out there, but that we are willfully blind to, because we can't handle, don't want to handle, the conflict that it provokes.
But when we dare to break that silence, or when we dare to see, and we create conflict, we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking.
Open information is fantastic, open networks are essential.
But the truth won't set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it.
Openness isn't the end.
It's the beginning.

Now, I don't usually like cartoons, I don't think many of them are funny, I find them weird. But I love this cartoon from the New Yorker.
So, the guy is telling the cat, don't you dare think outside the box.
Well, I'm afraid I used to be the cat.
I always wanted to be outside the box.
And it's partly because I came to this field from a different background, chemist and a bacterial geneticist.
So, what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer, sources of cancer, or, for that matter, why you are who you are, didn't make sense.
So, let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that and how I went about it.
So, to begin with, however, I have to give you a very, very quick lesson in developmental biology, with apologies to those of you who know some biology.
So, when your mom and dad met, there is a fertilized egg, that round thing with that little blip.
It grows and then it grows, and then it makes this handsome man.
So, this guy, with all the cells in his body, all have the same genetic information.
So how did his nose become his nose, his elbow his elbow, and why doesn't he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot?
It could. It has the genetic information.
You all remember, dolly, it came from a single mammary cell.
So, why doesn't it do it?
So, have a guess of how many cells he has in his body.
Somewhere between 10 trillion to 70 trillion cells in his body.
Trillion!
Now, how did these cells, all with the same genetic material, make all those tissues?
And so, the question I raised before becomes even more interesting if you thought about the enormity of this in every one of your bodies.
Now, the dominant cancer theory would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell, and it would make you a cancer victim.
Well, this did not make sense to me.
Do you even know how a trillion looks?
There it comes, these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes.
Now, if .0001 of these cells got mutated, and .00001 got cancer, you will be a lump of cancer.
You will have cancer all over you. And you're not.
Why not?
So, I decided over the years, because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture.
And let me quickly tell you some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this.
To begin with, I came to work with this virus that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken.
Rous discovered this in 1911.
It was the first cancer virus discovered, and when I call it "oncogene," meaning "cancer gene."
So, he made a filtrate, he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter, and he injected it to another chicken, and he got another tumor.
So, scientists were very excited, and they said, a single oncogene can do it.
All you need is a single oncogene.
So, they put the cells in cultures, chicken cells, dumped the virus on it, and it would pile up, and they would say, this is malignant and this is normal.
And again this didn't make sense to me.
So for various reasons, we took this oncogene, attached it to a blue marker, and we injected it into the embryos.
Now look at that. There is that beautiful feather in the embryo.
Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell, and they're part of the feather.
So, when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish, we got a mass of blue cells.
So, in the chicken you get a tumor, in the embryo you don't, you dissociate, you put it in a dish, you get another tumor.
What does that mean?
That means that microenvironment and the context which surrounds those cells actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do.
Now, let's take a normal example.
The normal example, let's take the human mammary gland.
I work on breast cancer.
So, here is a lovely human breast.
And many of you know how it looks, except that inside that breast, there are all these pretty, developing, tree-like structures.
So, we decided that what we like to do is take just a bit of that mammary gland, which is called an "acinus," where there are all these little things inside the breast where the milk goes, and the end of the nipple comes through that little tube when the baby sucks.
And we said, wonderful! Look at this pretty structure.
We want to make this a structure, and ask the question, how do the cells do that?
So, we took the red cells -- you see the red cells are surrounded by blue, other cells that squeeze them, and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert, and it was just having a structure to keep the shape, and so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago, and you see this cell is actually quite pretty.
It has a bottom, it has a top, it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk, because it just came from an early pregnant mouse.
You take these cells, you put them in a dish, and within three days, they look like that.
They completely forget.
So you take them out, you put them in a dish, they don't make milk. They completely forget.
For example, here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk on the left, there is nothing on the right.
Look at the nuclei. The nuclei in the cell on the left is in the animal, the one on the right is in a dish.
They are completely different from each other.
So, what does this tell you?
This tells you that here also, context overrides.
In different contexts, cells do different things.
But how does context signal?
So, Einstein said that "For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope."
So, you can imagine the amount of skepticism I received -- couldn't get money, couldn't do a whole lot of other things, but I'm so glad it all worked out.
So, we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse, and all those lovely acini are there, every one of those with the red around them are an acinus, and we said okay, we are going to try and make this, and I said, maybe that red stuff around the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold, maybe it has information, maybe it tells the cells what to do, maybe it tells the nucleus what to do.
So I said, extracellular matrix, which is this stuff called ECM, signals and actually tells the cells what to do.
So, we decided to make things that would look like that.
We found some gooey material that had the right extracellular matrix in it, we put the cells in it, and lo and behold, in about four days, they got reorganized and on the right, is what we can make in culture.
On the left is what's inside the animal, we call it in vivo, and the one in culture was full of milk, the lovely red there is full of milk.
So, we Got Milk, for the American audience.
All right. And here is this beautiful human cell, and you can imagine that here also, context goes.
So, what do we do now?
I made a radical hypothesis.
I said, if it's true that architecture is dominant, architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it's normal.
Could this be done?
So, we tried it.
In order to do that, however, we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant, and on the left is the single normal cell, human breast, put in three-dimensional gooey gel that has extracellular matrix, it makes all these beautiful structures.
On the right, you see it looks very ugly, the cells continue to grow, the normal ones stop.
And you see here in higher magnification the normal acinus and the ugly tumor.
So we said, what is on the surface of these ugly tumors?
Could we calm them down -- they were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up -- and make them to the level of the normal?
Well, it was wonderful. Boggles my mind.
This is what we got.
We can revert the malignant phenotype.
And in order to show you that the malignant phenotype I didn't just choose one, here are little movies, sort of fuzzy, but you see that on the left are the malignant cells, all of them are malignant, we add one single inhibitor in the beginning, and look what happens, they all look like that.
We inject them into the mouse, the ones on the right, and none of them would make tumors.
We inject the other ones in the mouse, 100 percent tumors.
So, it's a new way of thinking about cancer, it's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer.
We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level, and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment.
All right, thus form and function interact dynamically and reciprocally.
And here is another five seconds of repose, is my mantra. Form and function.
And of course, we now ask, where do we go now?
We'd like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic.
But before we do that, I'd like you to think that at any given time when you're sitting there, in your 70 trillion cells, the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus, the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix and this is how your balance is kept and restored.
We have made a lot of discoveries, we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin.
We have shown that there's little pieces of DNA on the specific genes of the mammary gland that actually respond to extracellular matrix.
It has taken many years, but it has been very rewarding.
And before I get to the next slide, I have to tell you that there are so many additional discoveries to be made.
There is so much mystery we don't know.
And I always say to the students and post-docs I lecture to, don't be arrogant, because arrogance kills curiosity.
Curiosity and passion.
You need to always think, what else needs to be discovered?
And maybe my discovery needs to be added to or maybe it needs to be changed.
So, we have now made an amazing discovery, a post-doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me, what do the cells do when you put them in?
What do they do in the beginning when they do?
I said, I don't know, we couldn't look at them.
We didn't have high images in the old days.
So she, being an imager and a physicist, did this incredible thing.
This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions.
Look at it. It's constantly doing this.
Has a coherent movement.
You put the cancer cells there, and they do go all over, they do this. They don't do this.
And when we revert the cancer cell, it again does this.
Absolutely boggles my mind.
So the cell acts like an embryo. What an exciting thing.
So I'd like to finish with a poem.
Well I used to love English literature, and I debated in college, which one should I do?
And unfortunately or fortunately, chemistry won.
But here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines.
It's called "Among the School Children."
"O body swayed to music / O brightening glance / How [can we know] the dancer from the dance?"
And here is Merce Cunningham, I was fortunate to dance with him when I was younger, and here he is a dancer, and while he is dancing, he is both the dancer and the dance.
The minute he stops, we have neither.
So it's like form and function.
Now, I'd like to show you a current picture of my group.
I have been fortunate to have had these magnificant students and post-docs who have taught me so much, and I have had many of these groups come and go.
They are the future and I try to make them not be afraid of being the cat and being told, don't think outside the box.
And I'd like to leave you with this thought.
On the left is water coming through the shore, taken from a NASA satellite.
On the right, there is a coral.
Now if you take the mammary gland and spread it and take the fat away, on a dish it looks like that.
Do they look the same? Do they have the same patterns?
Why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again?
And I'd like to submit to you that we have sequenced the human genome, we know everything about the sequence of the gene, the language of the gene, the alphabet of the gene, But we know nothing, but nothing, about the language and alphabet of form.
So, it's a wonderful new horizon, it's a wonderful thing to discover for the young and the passionate old, and that's me.
So go to it!

<title>Mina Bissell: Experiments that point to a new understanding of cancer</title>
<description>For decades, researcher Mina Bissell pursued a revolutionary idea -- that a cancer cell doesn't automatically become a tumor, but rather, depends on surrounding cells for cues on how to develop. She shares the two key experiments that proved the prevailing wisdom about cancer growth was wrong.</description>
<keywords>biology,cancer,health care,science</keywords>

Three years ago, I got a phone call, based on an earlier film I had made, with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.
My idea -- and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night, and we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep -- I was excited, with this phone call.
I was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets, and I realized I'd gotten to know their stories, and I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tell a warrior's story as it unfolded.
So I went to bed that night pretty excited.
Not sure of all the details, but excited.
It wasn't at four in the morning, but it was closer to midnight.
Woke straight up. Wide-awake as could be.
And I had this idea: what if I could, in effect, virtually embed, and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers?
To tell the story from the inside out, versus the outside in?
So, I called back Major Heilshorn, who's the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard.
And he knew me, so I was like, "Greg?"
He's like, "Yes, Deborah?"
Told him my idea, and you know, he is one of the bravest men in the world, as is General Blair, who, in the end, gave me permission to try this experiment.
Within 10 days, I was down at Fort Dix.
He gave me my pick of units.
I picked one unit -- Charlie Company, Third of the 172nd, they're mountain infantry -- for two reasons.
One, they're infantry.
Number two, they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda, so I knew they would have Internet access.
The caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer.
This was a big thing that I think when Major H told me, I wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean.
So what that meant was, when I went down to Fort Dix, I had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision.
You can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got.
The opening one was, "What the fuck do you know about the National Guard?"
I started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars.
Gave them about a nine minute response, and there we went.
So, I'd like to show the clip of the film.
It's our trailer, because I know, obviously you guys are busy, many of you may not have had a chance to see it.
So, I want to show the trailer, and then I'm going to take apart one scene in detail.
If we could roll?
Stephen Pink: This is Sergeant Stephen Pink.
Michael Moriarty: Specialist Michael Moriarty.
Zack Bazzi: Do I really want to go? Probably not.
We're not supposed to talk to the media.
SP: I'm not the media, dammit!
MM: The day is here. Life will change.
Voice: The real deal, man! You ready?
Bring it on! You ready? Voice 2: Iraq, here we come!
ZB: Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat.
It's natural instinct.
SP: If you let fear get to you, then you're not going to be doing your job.
MM: Every single time you go out there, there's attacks.
It's unbelievable.
ZB: Hey, Nestor, your ass crack is right in my face.
Soldiers: IV! Are we on fire? IV!
Man down! Man down!
MM: Keep going, brother. You wanna play?
Michael Moriarty's Wife: It's really hard for him to not have his dad.
MM: This little kid is in the middle of a war zone.
Stephen Pink's Girlfriend: In the beginning, he's like, "Write something dirty!"
George W. Bush: The world's newest democracy.
MM: They're shooting at me.
SP: You don't put 150,000 troops in there, and say we're there to create democracy.
We've got a drive through window at Burger King now.
SP: We're here to create money.
MM: I support George Bush. We're not there for the oil.
Jon Baril: The worst thing in my life.
SP: Baril, don't look at it, bud.
Michael Moriarty's Wife: He's not the same person anymore.
MM: I will not go back.
Kevin Shangraw: The Iraqi people are who we are there to help -- and we just killed one.
Soldiers: Sergeant Smith is down! Sergeant Smith is down?
There they are! Right there! Fire, fire!
JB: It'll be a better country in 20 years, 'cause we were there.
I hope.
Deborah Scranton: Thank you.
One of the things I'd like to talk to you about is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about.
And I'd like to relate an experience I had here at TED.
I don't know how many of you might imagine it, but there's actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq.
Paul? Come on, stand up.
This is Paul Anthony.
He served -- -- with the Marines, and I want to tell you a little, brief story.
We were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software.
Right? And we started talking.
People will see my tag, and they'll see "The War Tapes," and then we'll start talking about war.
We got in a conversation with some other people in the class, and it went on and on.
I mean, we were there for an hour, talking.
And it really highlighted something that I would like to ask you guys to think about and hopefully to help with, which is, I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war, and about politics.
And really -- because maybe we're going to disagree.
Maybe it's going to get uncomfortable.
How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation?
And you know, Paul was talking, and he then turned to Constance and said, "You know, I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here, because I know she has my back."
And I want to say, I was nervous.
Because I'm used to doing Q&amp;As.
I really related to what James was saying yesterday, because I'm behind the camera.
You know, I can answer questions about my movie, but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time.
So, I wanted to say, Paul, I'm happy you're here, because I know you have my back.
This film was not about the Internet, but it could not have been made without it.
The guys' tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me.
In the meantime, the soldiers -- we would email and IM.
I didn't save all of them, because I didn't realize at the beginning that it would be something that I would want to keep track of.
But there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages that I was able to save.
The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it.
So I wanted to show you a clip, and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together.
If we could roll the clip.
SP: Today is sport. [Unclear] Radio: [Unclear] Christian soldiers.
SP: We like to give these insurgents a fair chance.
So, what we do, we ride with the windows down.
Because, you know, we obviously have the advantage. I'm just kidding.
We don't fucking ride with the goddam windows down.
It's not true. Very unsafe.
Whoa.
Right there.
SP: All right, let's get over to that site.
Be advised, we're leaving Taji right now.
We believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji, we're heading to that location now.
That's a fucking car bomb!
Motherfuckers!
Soldiers: Get your vest on!
Hey, get over the fucking -- yeah, yeah.
Any one-four elements get to the gate!
SP: Sheriff one-six, or any one-four elements, we need you at the gate of Taji right now, over.
I'll walk you through it.
SP: Stay low. Head over to the right.
Get your bag, get your bag!
SP: It was mass casualties.
Probably 20 dead, at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis.
SP: It just looked like, you know, someone had thrown a quarter through a guy, and it was just like -- there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds.
Everything was cauterized, and it was just like there was a void going through the body.
This is the scene north.
They just removed a burnt body, or half a body from here.
I don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down.
This is blood.
And you know, you walk, and you hear the pieces of skin.
And that's it, that's all that's left.
I remember giving three IVs, bandaging several wounded.
Soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall, shaking and screaming.
Medics who were terrified and couldn't perform.
I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji.
They can work on the post for pennies, but can't die there.
They've got to die outside.
If one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment, I would've slit his throat right there.
21:00 hours, and it's just our squad going through today's events in our heads, whether we want to or not.
News Anchor: More violence in Iraq.
Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of Baghdad.
SP: We made the news.
I feel exploited and proud at the same time.
I've lost all faith in the media -- a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of.
I should really thank God for saving my lucky ass.
I'll do that, then I'm gonna jerk off.
Because these pages smell like Linds, and there won't be any time for jerking off tomorrow.
Another mission at 06:00.
DS: Now -- -- thanks.
When I said earlier, to try and tell a story from the inside out, versus the outside in -- part of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding.
It's a new way of trying to make a documentary.
When I met the guys, and 10 of them agreed to take cameras -- in total, 21 ended up filming.
Five soldiers filmed the entire time.
There are three featured in the film.
The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email, and in it, attached a photo of that burned body out at the car.
And the tone from the email was, you know, it had been a very bad day, obviously.
And I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base.
So, I pinged Mike and I said, "Mike, can you please go get that interview with Pink?"
Because the thing that very often is missing is, in the military what they call "hot wash."
It's that immediate interview after something immediately happens, you know.
And if you let time go by, it kind of softens and smooths the edges.
And for me, I really wanted that.
So, in order to get the intimacy, to share that experience with you, the guys -- the two most popular mounts -- there was a camera on the turret, the gun turret, and then on the dashboard of the Humvee.
Most of the Humvees, we ended up mounting two cameras in them.
So you get to experience that in real time, right?
The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did within 24 hours of that episode happening.
Steve Pink reading his journal happened five months after he came home.
I knew about that journal, but it was very, very private.
And you know, you earn someone's trust, especially in doc filmmaking, through your relationship.
So, it wasn't until five months after he was home that he would read that journal.
Now, the news footage I put in there to try to show -- you know, I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have.
But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times, American soldiers saying, "Why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do?"
OK, this is a perfect example.
Pink's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire.
They didn't have to go outside the wire.
There were not Americans hurt out there.
They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives -- the Iraqis who work on the post.
So, when you may hear soldiers complaining, that's what they're talking about, you know?
And I think it's such an amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridging.
And when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q&amp;As, and people are really opinionated.
But it seems like people don't want to hear so much, or listen, or try to have an exchange.
And I'm as fiery as the next person, but I really think -- you know, different speakers have talked about their concern for the world, and my concern is that we have to have these conversations.
And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may, you know, we think we know.
But we just have to leave that little bit of openness, to know.
There's such a disconnect.
And for me, it's trying to bridge that disconnect.
I'll share one story.
I get -- I'm often asked, you know, for me, what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film.
And at screenings, inevitably -- you know, as I'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff -- usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions.
And usually, the first questions are, "Oh, what kind of cameras did you use?"
Or you know, these things.
But there's always a few guys, almost always, who are the last ones.
And I've learned over time that those are always the soldiers.
And they wait until pretty much everybody's gone.
And for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me, that then became my story, was -- for those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler -- it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents, where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed.
In this film, there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed.
A soldier came up to me and stood, you know really, pretty close, a foot away from me.
He's a big guy.
And he looked at me, and I smiled, and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes.
And he wasn't going to blink.
And he said, "My gunner was throwing candy."
And I knew what he was going to say.
The gunner was throwing candy.
They used to throw candy to the kids.
Kids got too close, very often.
And he said, "I killed a child.
And I'm a father. I have children.
I haven't been able to tell my wife.
I'm afraid she's going to think I'm a monster."
I hugged him, of course, and I said, you know, "It's going to be OK."
And he said, "I'm going to bring her to see your film.
And then I'm going to tell her."
So when I talk about a disconnect, it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier, which there obviously are. You know, these days, it's not like World War II, where there was a war front and a home front, and everybody seemed involved.
You can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on.
And often, I'll hear people say, who maybe know that I did this film, and they say, "Oh, you know, I'm against the war, but I support the soldiers."
And I've started to ask them, "Well, that's nice. What are you doing?
Are you volunteering at a VA?
You go and see anybody?
Do you, if you find out your neighbor's been, do you spend some time?
Not necessarily ask questions, but see if they want to talk?
Do you give money to any of the charities?"
You know, obviously, like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing, but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers.
I think, I challenge us to say -- to operationalize those terms, when we say we support someone, you know?
Are you a friend to them?
Do you really care?
And I would just say it's my hope, and I would ask you guys to please, you know, reach out a hand.
And really do give them a hug.
Thank you.

<title>Deborah Scranton: An Iraq war movie crowd-sourced from soldiers</title>
<description>Filmmaker Deborah Scranton talks about and shows clips from her documentary The War Tapes, which puts cameras in the hands of soldiers fighting in Iraq.</description>
<keywords>entertainment,film,global issues,storytelling,technology,war</keywords>

I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada.
She's an Italian fashion designer.
She goes to this vintage store in Paris with a friend of hers.
She's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga -- she loves it.
She's turning it inside out.
She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction.
Her friend says, "Buy it already."
She said, "I'll buy it, but I'm also going to replicate it."
Now, the academics in this audience may think, "Well, that sounds like plagiarism."
But to a fashionista, what it really is is a sign of Prada's genius: that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket that doesn't need to be changed by one iota, and to be current and to be now.
You might also be asking whether it's possible that this is illegal for her to do this.
Well, it turns out that it's actually not illegal.
In the fashion industry, there's very little intellectual property protection.
They have trademark protection, but no copyright protection and no patent protection to speak of.
All they have, really, is trademark protection, and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design.
The only thing that they can't copy is the actual trademark label within that piece of apparel.
That's one reason that you see logos splattered all over these products.
It's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists to knock off these designs because they can't knock off the logo.
But if you go to Santee Alley, yeah.
Well, yeah.
Canal Street, I know.
And sometimes these are fun, right?
Now, the reason for this, the reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection.
They didn't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing.
And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve because Joe Blow owns it.
But too utilitarian? I mean is that the way you think of fashion?
This is Vivienne Westwood. No!
We think of it as maybe too silly, too unnecessary.
Now, those of you who are familiar with the logic behind copyright protection -- which is that without ownership, there is no incentive to innovate -- might be really surprised by both the critical success of the fashion industry and the economic success of this industry.
What I'm going to argue today is that because there's no copyright protection in the fashion industry, fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design, things to cover our naked bodies, into something that we consider art.
Because there's no copyright protection in this industry, there's a very open and creative ecology of creativity.
Unlike their creative brothers and sisters, who are sculptors or photographers or filmmakers or musicians, fashion designers can sample from all their peers' designs.
They can take any element from any garment from the history of fashion and incorporate it into their own design.
They're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist.
And here, I suspect, they were influenced by the costumes in Avatar.
Maybe just a little.
Can't copyright a costume either.
Now, fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry.
This wedding dress here is actually made of sporks, and this dress is actually made of aluminum.
I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through.
So, one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying, which is really what it is, is the establishment of trends.
People think this is a magical thing. How does it happen?
Well, it's because it's legal for people to copy one another.
Some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain who sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear, but if you talk to any designer at any level, including these high-end designers, they always say their main inspiration comes from the street: where people like you and me remix and match our own fashion looks.
And that's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration, so it's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry.
Now, the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry.
They are notorious for knocking off high-end designs and selling them at very low prices.
And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits, but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers.
The courts have said over and over again, "You don't need any more intellectual property protection."
When you look at copies like this, you wonder: How do the luxury high-end brands remain in business?
If you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand?
Well, that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago.
We invited Tom Ford to come -- the conference was called, "Ready to Share: Fashion and the Ownership of Creativity" -- and we asked him exactly this question.
Here's what he had to say.
He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci, in case you didn't know.
Tom Ford: And we found after much research that -- actually not much research, quite simple research -- that the counterfeit customer was not our customer.
The people on Santee Alley are not the ones who shop at Gucci.
This is a very different demographic.
And, you know, a knock-off is never the same as an original high-end design, at least in terms of the materials; they're always made of cheaper materials.
But even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects, can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend.
There's lots of virtues of copying.
One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader palette of design choices to choose from than we ever have before, and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry, actually.
And this is a good thing. We need lots of options.
Fashion, whether you like it or not, helps you project who you are to the world.
Because of fast fashion, global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to.
And this, actually, is good news to trendsetters; they want trends to be set so that they can move product.
For fashionistas, they want to stay ahead of the curve.
They don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing.
And so, they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible.
I tell you, there is no rest for the fashionable.
Every season, these designers have to struggle to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love.
And this, let me tell you, is very good for the bottom line.
Now of course, there's a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process.
And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer.
He has complained a lot about people copying him, but in one interview I read, he said it has really forced him to up his game.
He had to come up with new ideas, new things that would be hard to copy.
He came up with this Bowden-wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium; if you make it from some sort of cheaper material, it'll actually crack in two.
It forced him to be a little more innovative.
And that actually reminded me of jazz great, Charlie Parker.
I don't know if you've heard this anecdote, but I have.
He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop was that he was pretty sure that white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound.
He wanted to make it too difficult to copy, and that's what fashion designers are doing all the time.
They're trying to put together a signature look, an aesthetic that reflects who they are.
When people knock it off, everybody knows because they've put that look out on the runway, and it's a coherent aesthetic.
I love these Gallianos.
Okay, we'll move on.
This is not unlike the world of comedy.
I don't know if you know that jokes also can't be copyright protected.
So when one-liners were really popular, everybody stole them from one another.
But now, we have a different kind of comic.
They develop a persona, a signature style, much like fashion designers.
And their jokes, much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer, really only work within that aesthetic.
If somebody steals a joke from Larry David, for instance, it's not as funny.
Now, the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they've learned how to copy themselves.
They knock themselves off.
They make deals with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic: the Santee Alley demographic.
Now, some fashion designers will say, "It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect.
In other countries there is protection for our artful designs."
But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world, it turns out that the protection that's offered is really ineffectual.
In Japan, for instance, which I think is the third largest market, they have a design law; it protects apparel, but the novelty standard is so high, you have to prove that your garment has never existed before, it's totally unique.
And that's sort of like the novelty standard for a U.S. patent, which fashion designers never get -- rarely get here in the states.
In the European Union, they went in the other direction.
Very low novelty standard, anybody can register anything.
But even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there, they don't register their garments, generally, and there's not a lot of litigation.
It turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low.
A person can come in and take somebody else's gown, cut off three inches from the bottom, go to the E.U. and register it as a new, original design.
So, that does not stop the knock-off artists.
If you look at the registry, actually, a lot of the registered things in the E.U.
are Nike T-shirts that are almost identical to one another.
But this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg.
She is the head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and she has told her constituency that she is going to get copyright protection for fashion designs.
The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though.
I don't think the legislation is going anywhere, because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that's just part of a global trend.
Who owns a look?
That is a very difficult question to answer.
It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time, and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive.
You know, it's not just the fashion industry that doesn't have copyright protection.
There's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection, including the food industry.
You cannot copyright a recipe because it's a set of instructions, it's fact, and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish.
Same with automobiles.
It doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look, you cannot copyright the sculptural design.
It's a utilitarian article, that's why.
Same with furniture, it's too utilitarian.
Magic tricks, I think they're instructions, sort of like recipes: no copyright protection.
Hairdos, no copyright protection.
Open source software, these guys decided they didn't want copyright protection.
They thought it'd be more innovative without it.
It's really hard to get copyright for databases.
Tattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool.
They share their designs.
Jokes, no copyright protection.
Fireworks displays, the rules of games, the smell of perfume: no.
And some of these industries may seem sort of marginal to you, but these are the gross sales for low I.P. industries, industries with very little copyright protection, and there's the gross sales of films and books.
It ain't pretty.
So you talk to people in the fashion industry and they're like, "Shhh!
Don't tell anybody we can actually steal from each other's designs.
It's embarrassing."
But you know what? It's revolutionary, and it's a model that a lot of other industries -- like the ones we just saw with the really small bars -- they might have to think about this.
Because right now, those industries with a lot of copyright protection are operating in an atmosphere where it's as if they don't have any protection, and they don't know what to do.
When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries that didn't have copyright protection, I thought, "What exactly is the underlying logic?
I want a picture." And the lawyers do not provide a picture, so I made one.
These are the two main sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law.
It is more complex than this, but this will do.
First: Is something an artistic object?
Then it deserves protection.
Is it a utilitarian object?
Then no, it does not deserve protection.
This is a difficult, unstable binary.
The other one is: Is it an idea?
Is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society?
No protection.
Or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea: something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it?
The problem is that digital technology has completely subverted the logic of this physically fixed, expression versus idea concept.
Nowadays, we don't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold.
It's a digital file.
It is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds.
And these things, because we can copy and transmit them so easily, actually circulate within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically instantiated objects.
Now, the conceptual issues are truly profound when you talk about creativity and ownership and, let me tell you, we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out.
They're smart.
I'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay.
He's smart, he's smart.
But you want an interdisciplinary team of people hashing this out, trying to figure out: What is the kind of ownership model, in a digital world, that's going to lead to the most innovation?
And my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future.

And I really want to thank Veronica Jauriqui for making this very fashionable presentation.
Thank you so much.

<title>Johanna Blakley: Lessons from fashion's free culture</title>
<description>Copyright law's grip on film, music and software barely touches the fashion industry ... and fashion benefits in both innovation and sales, says Johanna Blakley. In her talk, she talks about what all creative industries can learn from fashion's free culture. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>
<keywords>business,creativity,culture,design,fashion,law,media</keywords>

This strange-looking plant is called the Llareta.
What looks like moss covering rocks is actually a shrub comprised of thousands of branches, each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end and so densely packed together that you could actually stand on top of it.
This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile, and it happens to be 3,000 years old.
It also happens to be a relative of parsley.
For the past five years, I've been researching, working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are 2,000 years old and older.
The project is part art and part science.
There's an environmental component.
And I'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale.
I selected 2,000 years as my minimum age because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from there.
What you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi, living on the remote island of Yakushima.
The tree was in part a catalyst for the project.
I'd been traveling in Japan without an agenda other than to photograph, and then I heard about this tree that is 2,180 years old and knew that I had to go visit it.
It wasn't until later, when I was actually back home in New York that I got the idea for the project.
So it was the slow churn, if you will.
I think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art, science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on.
So I started researching, and to my surprise, this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences.
And -- perhaps naively -- I was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences that deals with this idea of global species longevity.
So what you're looking at here is the rhizocarpon geographicum, or map lichen, and this is around 3,000 years old and lives in Greenland, which is a long way to go for some lichens.
Visiting Greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north.
It was very primal and more remote than anything I'd ever experienced before.
And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences.
One was when I had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord, only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found.
And it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail, so I was literally left to my own devices.
But luckily, it worked out obviously, but it was a humbling experience to feel so disconnected.
And then a few days later, we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream near our campsite, where the fish were so abundant that you could literally reach into the stream and grab out a foot-long trout with your bare hands.
It was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet.
And then, of course, there's the lichens.
These lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years.
I think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective.
And what you're looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon.
And if the title "Searching for Armillaria Death Rings," sounds ominous, it is.
The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus, killing certain species of trees in the forest.
It's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the "humongous fungus" because it happens to be one of the world's largest organisms as well.
So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus, I got some maps and some GPS coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings, the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees.
So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo, but I do know the fungus is down there.
And then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree.
So that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood is the mycelial felt of the fungus, and what it's doing -- it's actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients.
So this strategy has served it pretty well -- it's 2,400 years old.
And then from underground to underwater.
This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago that's around 2,000 years old.
And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one.
This is at about 60 feet or 18 meters, depth.
And you'll see, there's some damage to the surface of the coral.
That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it, though luckily, they lost interest before killing it.
Luckily still, it seems to be out of harm's way of the recent oil spill.
But that being said, we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet, and the full impact of that disaster Now this is something that I think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet.
This is clonal colony of Quaking Aspen trees, living in Utah, that is literally 80,000 years old.
What looks like a forest is actually only one tree.
Imagine that it's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system.
So what you have is one giant, interconnected, genetically identical individual that's been living for 80,000 years.
It also happens to be male and, in theory immortal.
This is a clonal tree as well.
This is the spruce Gran Picea, which at 9,550 years is a mere babe in the woods.
The location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection.
I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree, and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change.
As it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain, the vegetation zone is actually changing.
So we don't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them.
This is the Fortingall Yew -- no, I'm just kidding -- this is the Fortingall Yew.
But I put that slide in there because I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project.
And aside from coral, the answer is no.
Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is -- any guesses?
Rachel Sussman: 300? No, 175 is the oldest living tortoise, so nowhere near 2,000.
And then, you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached 405 years old.
However, it died in the lab as they were determining its age.
The most interesting discovery of late, I think is the so-called immortal jellyfish, which has actually been observed in the lab to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state after reaching full maturity.
So that being said, it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild.
And back to the yew here.
So as you can see, it's in a churchyard; it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall.
And there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the U.K., but if you do the math, you'll remember it's actually the yew trees that were there first, then the churches.
And now down to another part of the world.
I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa with an expert in Baobab trees.
And we saw a number of them, and this is most likely the oldest.
It's around 2,000, and it's called the Sagole Baobab.
And you know, I think of all of these organisms as palimpsests.
They contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves, and they also contain records of natural and human events.
And the Baobabs in particular are a great example of this.
You can see that this one has names carved into its trunk, but it also records some natural events.
So the Baobabs, as they get older, tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out.
And this can create great natural shelters for animals, but they've also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses, including a bar, a prison and even a toilet inside of a tree.
And this brings me to another favorite of mine -- I think, because it is just so unusual.
This plant is called the Welwitschia, and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola, where it's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea.
And what's more, it's actually a tree.
It's a primitive conifer.
You'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center.
And what looks like two big heaps of leaves, is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time.
And it actually never sheds those leaves, so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom.
I spoke to a biologist at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from, and his thought was that if you travel around Namibia, you see that there are a number of petrified forests, and the logs are all -- the logs are all giant coniferous trees, and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from.
So his thought was that flooding in the north of Africa actually brought those coniferous trees down tens of thousands of years ago, and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation to this unique desert environment.
This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things.
This is something called an underground forest.
So, I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden, who explained that certain species of trees have adapted to this region.
It's bushfelt region, which is dry and prone to a lot of fires, as so what these trees have done is, if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree, and that this is ground level, imagine that the whole thing, that whole bulk of the tree, migrated underground, and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface.
That way, when a fire roars through, it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed.
The tree can easily recover.
These also tend to grow clonally, the oldest of which is 13,000 years old.
Back in the U.S., there's a couple plants of similar age.
This is the clonal Creosote bush, which is around 12,000 years old.
If you've been in the American West, you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous, but that being said, you see that this has this unique, circular form.
And what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards from that original shape.
And it's one -- again, that interconnected root system, making it one genetically identical individual.
It also has a friend nearby -- well, I think they're friends.
This is the clonal Mojave yucca, it's about a mile away, and it's a little bit older than 12,000 years.
And you see it has that similar circular form.
And there's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it.
And both of these, the yucca and the Creosote bush, live on Bureau of Land Management land, and that's very different from being protected in a national park.
In fact, this land is designated for recreational all-terrain vehicle use.
So, now I want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet.
This is Siberian Actinobacteria, which is between 400,000 and 600,000 years old.
This bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours.
And what they found, by doing research into the permafrost, was this bacteria.
But what's unique about it is that it's doing DNA repair below freezing.
And what that means is that it's not dormant -- it's actually been living and growing for half a million years.
It's also probably one the most vulnerable of the oldest living things, because if the permafrost melts, it won't survive.
This is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things, so you can get a sense of where they are; you see they're all over the world.
The blue flags represent things that I've already photographed, and the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to.
You'll see also, there's a flag on Antarctica.
I'm trying to travel there to find 5,000 year-old moss, which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula.
So, I probably have about two more years left on this project -- on this phase of the project, but after five years, I really feel like I know what's at the heart of this work.
The oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past, a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future.
They've survived for millennia in desert, in the permafrost, at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean.
They've withstood untold natural perils and human encroachments, but now some of them are in jeopardy, and they can't just get up and get out of the way.
It's my hope that, by going to find these organisms, that I can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future.
Thank you.

<keywords>biodiversity,biology,environment,life,nature,photography</keywords>

I've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days, talking to groups of students and professionals, and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes.
On the one hand, people say, "The time for change is now."
They want to be part of it.
They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.
But on the other hand, I hear people talking about fear, a sense of risk-aversion.
They say, "I really want to follow a life of purpose, but I don't know where to start.
I don't want to disappoint my family or friends."
I work in global poverty.
And they say, "I want to work in global poverty, but what will it mean about my career?
Will I be marginalized?
Will I not make enough money?
Will I never get married or have children?"
And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older -- and I'm glad I waited -- -- and has no children, I look at these young people and I say, "Your job is not to be perfect.
Your job is only to be human.
And nothing important happens in life without a cost."
These conversations really reflect what's happening at the national and international level.
Our leaders and ourselves want everything, but we don't talk about the costs.
We don't talk about the sacrifice.
One of my favorite quotes from literature was written by Tillie Olsen, the great American writer from the South.
In a short story called "Oh Yes," she talks about a white woman in the 1950s who has a daughter who befriends a little African American girl, and she looks at her child with a sense of pride, but she also wonders, what price will she pay?
"Better immersion than to live untouched."
But the real question is, what is the cost of not daring?
What is the cost of not trying?
I've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion.
One woman I knew who was a fellow at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation was named Ingrid Washinawatok.
She was a leader of the Menominee tribe, a Native American peoples.
And when we would gather as fellows, she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions.
And she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future, looking at them from the Earth, and they would look at them, holding them as stewards for that future.
Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other, not only as human beings, but to every living thing on the planet.
And tragically, in 1999, when she was in Colombia working with the U'wa people, focused on preserving their culture and language, she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the FARC.
And whenever we would gather the fellows after that, we would leave a chair empty for her spirit.
And more than a decade later, when I talk to NGO fellows, whether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House, and we talk about Ingrid, they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life's mission.
And when we think about legacy, I can think of no more powerful one, despite how short her life was.
And I've been touched by Cambodian women -- beautiful women, women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia.
And I met them in the early '90s.
In the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime, the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people, and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals, the artists, the dancers.
And at the end of the war, there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living.
And the women, who I was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors, told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps.
They said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance, hoping that others were alive and doing the same.
And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage, her hands at her side, and she talked about the reunion of the 30 after the war and how extraordinary it was.
And these big tears fell down her face, but she never lifted her hands to move them.
And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already, but the next generation.
And I sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands -- beautiful rhythms -- as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them, wearing these beautiful silk colors.
And I thought, after all this atrocity, this is how human beings really pray.
Because they're focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future.
And what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure.
I also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership.
And I have learned that power, particularly in its absolute form, is an equal opportunity provider.
In 1986, I moved to Rwanda, and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women to start that country's first microfinance bank.
And one of the women was Agnes -- there on your extreme left -- she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in Rwanda, and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of Rwanda.
We built this institution based on social justice, gender equity, this idea of empowering women.
But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end.
And though she had been part of building a liberal party, a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance, about three months before the genocide, she switched parties and joined the extremist party, Hutu Power, and she became the Minister of Justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women.
She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide.
And I would visit her in the prisons, sitting side-by-side, knees touching, and I would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us, but that maybe it's not monsters so much, but the broken parts of ourselves, sadnesses, secret shame, and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts, those fragments, if you will, and to make us look at other beings, human beings, as lesser than ourselves -- and in the extreme, to do terrible things.
And there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men.
I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male.
And so in a gathering where we're focused on women, while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them, we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered, unable to provide.
And that, when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job, no education, no possibility, well then it's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun.
Sometimes very small investments can release enormous, infinite potential that exists in all of us.
One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization, Suraj Sudhakar, has what we call moral imagination -- the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and lead from that perspective.
And he's been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera.
And they're incredible guys.
And together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums, and they're reading many TED authors and liking it.
And then they created a business plan competition.
Then they decided that they would do TEDx's.
And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men.
Alex, in some ways, said it best.
He said, "We used to feel like nobodies, but now we feel like somebodies."
And I think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link.
What we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other.
And the reason these young guys told me that they're doing these TEDx's is because they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused on HIV, or at best, microfinance.
And they wanted to celebrate what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare -- the photojournalists and the creatives, the graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs.
And they're doing it.
And my hat's off to you in Kibera.
My own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive.
At Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital -- money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity, but as full-bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions.
We leave our money for 10 to 15 years, and when we get it back, we invest in other innovations that focus on change.
I know it works.
We've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies, and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars into these forgotten markets.
This year alone, they've delivered 40 million services like maternal health care and housing, emergency services, solar energy, so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems.
Patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions, easy categories, because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument.
But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit.
And ultimately, we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact, measuring what is most important to us.
And my dream is we'll have a world one day where we don't just honor those who take money and make more money from it, but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways.
And it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change.
Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side-by-side -- one based on violence and the other on transcendence.
I happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers.
And the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of Islam who fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim.
And not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives, but they did more, because they created more hatred, more rage, more fear and certainly despair.
But less than 24 hours, I was 13 miles away from those mosques, visiting one of our Acumen investees, an incredible man, Jawad Aslam, who dares to live a life of immersion.
Born and raised in Baltimore, he studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate, and after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference.
For two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend, but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named Tasneem Saddiqui.
And he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital, but he continued to pay a price.
He stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes.
It took almost two years just to register the land.
But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person's action.
Today, 2,000 people live in 300 houses in this beautiful community.
And there's schools and clinics and shops.
But there's only one mosque.
And so I asked Jawad, "How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community.
Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays?"
He said, "Long story.
It was hard, it was a difficult road, but ultimately the leaders of the community came together, realizing we only have each other.
And we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams, and those imams would take turns, they would rotate who would say Friday prayer.
But the whole community, all the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni, would sit together and pray."
We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds.
We face huge issues as a world -- the financial crisis, global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness.
And every day we have a choice.
We can take the easier road, the more cynical road, which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was, a fear of each other, distancing and blame.
Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation, transcendence, compassion and love, but also accountability and justice.
I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles, who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States.
And he tells this incredible story about working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges, the first child to desegregate schools in the South -- in this case, New Orleans.
And he said that every day this six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress, would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily, calling her a monster, threatening to poison her -- distorted faces.
And every day he would watch her, and it looked like she was talking to the people.
And he would say, "Ruby, what are you saying?"
And she'd say, "I'm not talking."
And finally he said, "Ruby, I see that you're talking.
What are you saying?"
And she said, "Dr. Coles, I am not talking; I'm praying."
And he said, "Well, what are you praying?"
And she said, "I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing.'" At age six, this child was living a life of immersion, and her family paid a price for it.
But she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education.
My final story is about a young, beautiful man named Josephat Byaruhanga, who was another Acumen Fund fellow, who hails from Uganda, a farming community.
And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya, just 200 miles away.
And he said to me at the end of his year, "Jacqueline, it was so humbling, because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture.
But especially when I was talking to the African women, I sometimes made these mistakes -- it was so hard for me to learn how to listen."
And he said, "So I conclude that, in many ways, leadership is like a panicle of rice.
Because at the height of the season, at the height of its powers, it's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world, it reaches to the heavens."
And he said, "But right before the harvest, it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came."
We need leaders.
We ourselves need to lead from a place that has the audacity to believe we can, ourselves, extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man, woman and child on this planet.
And we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone.
Robert Kennedy once said that "few of us have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events."
And it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written.
Our lives are so short, and our time on this planet is so precious, and all we have is each other.
So may each of you live lives of immersion.
They won't necessarily be easy lives, but in the end, it is all that will sustain us.
Thank you.

I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from.
And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well.
When I'm walking around an art gallery, rooms and rooms full of paintings, after about 15 or 20 minutes, I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.
I'm not connecting to them.
Instead, I'm thinking about that cup of coffee I desperately need to wake me up.
I'm suffering from gallery fatigue.
How many of you out there suffer from -- yes. Ha ha, ha ha!
Now, sometimes you might last longer than 20 minutes, or even shorter, but I think we all suffer from it. And do you have the accompanying guilt?
For me, I look at the paintings on the wall and I think, somebody has decided to put them there, thinks they're good enough to be on that wall, but I don't always see it.
In fact, most of the time I don't see it.
And I leave feeling actually unhappy.
I feel guilty and unhappy with myself, rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting, I think there's something wrong with me.
And that's not a good experience, to leave a gallery like that.
The thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break.
If you think about going into a restaurant, when you look at the menu, are you expected to order every single thing on the menu?
No! You select.
If you go into a department store to buy a shirt, are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt?
Of course not, you can be selective. It's expected.
How come, then, it's not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery?
Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting?
Well I'm trying to take a different approach.
And there's two things I do: When I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast, and I look at everything, and I pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other.
I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something pulls me like a magnet and then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting.
So it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation.
I choose a painting. It might just be one painting in 50.
And then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting, and I tell myself a story about it.
Why a story? Well, I think that we are wired, our DNA tells us to tell stories.
We tell stories all the time about everything, and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy, chaotic place, and sometimes stories, we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit, trying to bring some order to it.
Why not apply that to our looking at paintings?
So I now have this sort of restaurant menu visiting of art galleries.
There are three paintings I'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them.
The first one needs little introduction -- "Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer, 17th-century Dutch painter.
This is the most glorious painting.
I first saw it when I was 19, and I immediately went out and got a poster of it, and in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house.
It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone, I never tire of looking at her.
What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with was just the gorgeous colors he uses and the light falling on her face.
But I think what's kept me still coming back year after year is another thing, and that is the look on her face, the conflicted look on her face.
I can't tell if she's happy or sad, and I change my mind all the time.
So that keeps me coming back.
One day, 16 years after I had this poster on my wall, I lay in bed and looked at her, and I suddenly thought, I wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that.
And it was the first time I'd ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him.
Always before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl.
Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship.
And I thought, well, what is that relationship?
So I went to find out. I did some research and discovered, we have no idea who she is.
In fact, we don't know who any of the models in any of Vermeer's paintings are, and we know very little about Vermeer himself.
Which made me go, "Yippee!"
I can do whatever I want, I can come up with whatever story I want to.
So here's how I came up with the story.
First of all, I thought, I've got to get her into the house.
How does Vermeer know her?
Well, there've been suggestions that she is his 12-year-old daughter.
The daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting.
And I thought, no, it's a very intimate look, but it's not a look a daughter gives her father.
For one thing, in Dutch painting of the time, if a woman's mouth was open, it was indicating sexual availability.
It would have been inappropriate for Vermeer to paint his daughter like that.
So it's not his daughter, but it's somebody close to him, physically close to him.
Well, who else would be in the house?
A servant, a lovely servant.
So, she's in the house.
How do we get her into the studio?
We don't know very much about Vermeer, but the little bits that we do know, one thing we know is that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he -- his studio. He also had 11 children.
It would have been a chaotic, noisy household.
And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before, you know that they're incredibly calm and quiet.
How does a painter paint such calm, quiet paintings with 11 kids around?
Well, he compartmentalizes his life.
He gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.
Not the wife, not the kids. Okay, the maid can come in and clean."
She's in the studio. He's got her in the studio, they're together.
And he decides to paint her.
He has her wear very plain clothes.
Now, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings wore velvet, silk, fur, very sumptuous materials.
This is very plain; the only thing that isn't plain is her pearl earring.
Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings.
So those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they?
We happen to know, there's a list of Catharina, the wife's clothes.
Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur, a yellow and black bodice, and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings, different women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings.
So clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women.
It's not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife.
So we've got all the elements for our story.
She's in the studio with him for a long time.
These paintings took a long time to make.
They would have spent the time alone, all that time.
She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.
She's gorgeous. She obviously loves him. She's conflicted.
And does the wife know? Maybe not.
And if she doesn't, well -- that's the story.
The next painting I'm going to talk about is called "Boy Building a House of Cards" by Chardin.
He's an 18th-century French painter best known for his still lifes, but he did occasionally paint people.
And in fact, he painted four versions of this painting, different boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.
I like this version the best, because some of the boys are older and some are younger, and to me, this one, like Goldilocks's porridge, is just right.
He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.
He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.
The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed in this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting, and you look at it, and I found that when I was looking at it, I was standing there going, "Look at me. Please look at me."
And he didn't look at me. He was still looking at his cards, and that's one of the seductive elements of this painting is, he's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us.
And that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece, of a painting when there's a lack of resolution.
He's never going to look at me.
So I was thinking of a story where, if I'm in this position, who could be there looking at him?
Not the painter, I don't want to think about the painter.
I'm thinking of an older version of himself.
He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant, saying, "Look at me. I want to warn you about what you're about to go through. Please look at me."
And he never does.
And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" -- we don't know if she's happy or sad.
I've written an entire novel about her, and I still don't know if she's happy or sad.
Again and again, back to the painting, looking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.
And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily, but not really, and we come back again and again.
The last painting I'm going to talk about is called "Anonymous" by anonymous.
This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.
They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury, and then they discovered that it wasn't him, and they have no idea who it is.
Now, in the National Portrait Gallery, if you don't know the biography of the painting, it's kind of useless to you.
They can't hang it on the wall, because they don't know who he is.
So unfortunately, this orphan spends most of his time in storage, along with quite a number of other orphans, some of them some beautiful paintings.
This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons: One is the disconnection between his mouth that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful.
He's not happy, and why isn't he happy?
The second thing that really attracted me were his bright red cheeks.
He is blushing. He's blushing for his portrait being made!
This must be a guy who blushes all the time.
What is he thinking about that's making him blush?
The third thing that made me stop in my tracks is his absolutely gorgeous doublet.
Silk, gray, those beautiful buttons.
And you know what it makes me think of, is it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed.
I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks, and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him, and I thought, is that what he's thinking about?
And I thought, if I'm going to make a story, what's the last thing I'm going to put in there?
Well, what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with?
And I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay.
He'd be preoccupied with his inheritance, with his heir.
Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune?
You put all those together, and you've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.
Now, here's the story.
It's short.
"Rosy" I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me.
It has a plain high collar, detachable sleeves and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread, set close together so that the fit is snug.
The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed.
Perhaps that was the intention.
I first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor.
I knew even before I stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed.
I have always flushed easily, from physical exertion, from wine, from high emotion.
As a boy, I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys, but not by George.
Only George could call me Rosy.
I would not allow anyone else.
He managed to make the word tender.
When I made the announcement, George did not turn rosy, but went pale as my doublet.
He should not have been surprised.
It has been a common assumption that I would one day marry his cousin.
But it is difficult to hear the words aloud.
I know, I could barely utter them.
Afterwards, I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden.
Despite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale.
We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.
"What do you think of my doublet?" I asked.
He glanced at me. "That collar looks to be strangling you."
"We will still see each other," I insisted.
"We can still hunt and play cards and attend court.
Nothing need change."
George did not speak.
"I am 23 years old. It is time for me to marry and produce an heir. It is expected of me."
George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.
"Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James.
I'm sure you'll be content together."
He never used my nickname again.
Thank you.
Thank you.

<description>When Tracy Chevalier looks at paintings, she imagines the stories behind them: How did the painter meet his model? What would explain that look in her eye? Why is that man … blushing? She shares three stories inspired by portraits, including the one that led to her best-selling novel "Girl With a Pearl Earring."</description>
<keywords>arts,entertainment,history,storytelling</keywords>

My thing with school lunch is, it's a social justice issue.
I'm the Director of Nutrition Services for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees and 17 locations, 9,600 kids.
I'm doing 7,100 meals a day and I've been doing it for two years, trying to change how we feed kids in America.
And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today.
These are some of my kids with a salad bar.
I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there.
Everyone says it couldn't be done.
Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar, big kids would spit in it -- neither happened.
When I took over this, I tried to really figure out, like, what my vision would be.
How do we really change children's relationship to food?
And I'll tell you why we need to change it, but we absolutely have to change it.
And what I came to understand is, we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids.
And that if we don't do that, the antithesis, although we've heard otherwise, is we're really going to become extinct, because we're feeding our children to death.
That's my premise.
We're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker.
And the reason this is happening, by and large, is because of our food system and the way the government commodifies food, the way the government oversees our food, the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates that's unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools.
And by -- tacitly, all of us send our kids, or grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school and tell them to learn, you know, learn what's in those schools.
And when you feed these kids bad food, that's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about.
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness.
We now live in a country where most of us don't decide, by and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont, who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.
They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country.
These are -- 10 companies control much of what's in our grocery stores, much of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem.
So when I started thinking about these issues and how I was going to change what kids ate, I really started focusing on what we would teach them.
And the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region.
And clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage, or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away, as oil hits its peak oil, you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should, or could, be moving food 1,500 miles before we eat it.
So we talked to kids about that, and we really start to feed kids regional food.
And then we talk about organic food.
Now, most school districts can't really afford organic food, but we, as a nation, have to start thinking about consuming, growing and feeding our children food that's not chock-full of chemicals.
We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.
We can't keep doing that.
You know, it doesn't work.
And the results of that are kids getting sick.
One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.
Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America is consumed in animal husbandry.
We are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein every day.
Seventy percent -- it's unbelievable.
And the result of it is, we have diseases.
We have things like E. coli that we can't fix, that we can't make kids better when they get sick.
And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed, but it's an issue in the food supply.
One of my favorite facts is that U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.
That means every one of us, and our children, consumes what would equal a five-pound bag -- those bags you have at home. If I had one here and ripped it open, and that pile I would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply, because of the way we consume produce in America.
The USDA allows these antibiotics, these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply, and the USDA paid for this ad in Time magazine.
Okay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT, but we know it wasn't good for you and me.
And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply.
And that has to change, you know.
The USDA cannot be seen as the be-all and end-all of what we feed our kids and what's allowed.
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food.
That's what I really try and get people to understand.
I really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important.
It's consuming food in a way in which we'll still have a planet, in which kids will grow up to be healthy, and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we're seeing.
It really is just a new idea.
I mean, people toss around sustainability, but we have to figure out what sustainability is.
In less than 200 years, you know, just in a few generations, we've gone from being 200 -- being 100 percent, 95 percent farmers to less than 2 percent of farmers.
We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers -- 2.1 million prisoners, 1.9 million farmers.
And we spend 35,000 dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison, and school districts spend 500 dollars a year feeding a child.
It's no wonder, you know, we have criminals.
And what's happening is, we're getting sick.
We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick.
It is about what we feed them.
What goes in is what we are.
We really are what we eat.
And if we continue down this path, if we continue to feed kids bad food, if we continue not to teach them what good food is, what's going to happen? You know, what is going to happen?
What's going to happen to our whole medical system?
What's going to happen is, we're going to have kids that have a life less long than our own.
The CDC, the Center for Disease Control, has said, of the children born in the year 2000 -- those seven- and eight-year-olds today -- one out of every three Caucasians, one out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime.
And if that's not enough, they've gone on to say, most before they graduate high school.
This means that 40 or 45 percent of all school-aged children could be insulin-dependent within a decade. Within a decade.
What's going to happen?
Well, the CDC has gone further to say that those children born in the year 2000 could be the first generation in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents.
And it's because of what we feed them.
Because eight-year-olds don't get to decide -- and if they do, you should be in therapy.
You know, we are responsible for what kids eat.
But oops, maybe they're responsible for what kids eat.
Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year marketing non-nutrient foods to kids.
20 billion dollars a year. 10,000 ads most kids see.
They spend 500 dollars for every one dollar -- 500 dollars marketing foods that kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar marketing healthy, nutritious food.
The result of which is kids think they're going to die if they don't have chicken nuggets.
You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more, and more, and more.
This is the USDA portion size, that little, tiny thing.
And the one over there, that's bigger than my head, is what McDonald's and Burger King and those big companies think we should eat.
And why can they serve that much?
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps and 99-cent double burgers?
It's because of the way the government commodifies food, and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non-nutrient foods really, really cheap.
Which is why I say it's a social justice issue.
Now, I said I'm doing this in Berkeley, and you might think, "Oh, Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley."
Well, this is the food I found 24 months ago.
This is not even food.
This is the stuff we were feeding our kids: Extremo Burritos, corn dogs, pizza pockets, grilled cheese sandwiches.
Everything came in plastic, in cardboard.
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter.
The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can, it came frozen in a box.
The USDA allows this.
The USDA allows all of this stuff.
In case you can't tell, that's, like, pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes.
Chicken nuggets, Tater Tots, chocolate milk with high fructose, canned fruit cocktail -- a reimbursable meal.
That's what the government says is okay to feed our kids.
It ain't okay. You know what? It is not okay.
And we, all of us, have to understand that this is about us, that we can make a difference here.
Now I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets, but I'm sure you're rich if you did.
But whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart, a giraffe, a star?
Well, Tyson did, because there's no chicken in the chicken.
And that they could figure it out, that we could sell this stuff to kids.
You know, what's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken?
But this is what most schools serve.
In fact, this may be what a lot of parents serve, as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve.
We really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food.
We really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe.
You know, that vegetables are actually colorful, that they have flavor, that carrots grow in the ground, that strawberries grow in the ground.
There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush.
You know, we have to change the way we teach kids about these things.
There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools doing farm-to-school programs. There's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools.
Now, in Berkeley, we've gone totally fresh.
We have no high-fructose corn syrup, no trans fats, no processed foods.
We're cooking from scratch every day.
We have 25 percent of our -- thank you -- 25 percent of our stuff is organic and local. We cook.
Those are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m.
every day and go cook the food for the kids, because this is what we need to do.
We can't keep serving kids processed crap, full of chemicals, and expect these are going to be healthy citizens.
You're not going to get the next generation, or the generation after, to be able to think like this if they're not nourished.
If they're eating chemicals all the time, they're not going to be able to think.
They're not going to be smart.
You know what? They're just going to be sick.
Now one of the things that -- what happened when I went into Berkeley is I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people, very, very different, and I needed to market it.
I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent.
And these calendars really started to lay out my program.
Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district.
So this is a typical menu.
This is what we're serving this week at the schools.
And you see these recipes on the side?
Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes.
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes.
They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias.
If we're going to change children's relationship to food, it's delicious, nutritious food in the cafeterias, hands-on experience -- you're looking in cooking and gardening classes -- and academic curriculum to tie it all together.
Now you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA, and I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid, this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top, I don't know.
You know, run up into the end of the rainbow, I don't know what you do with it. So, I came up with my own.
This is available on my website in English and Spanish, and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food.
The really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables.
We have to start changing this.
We have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference.
We have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools.
And why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation, maybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer.
What are kids learning? Where is the family time?
Where is socialization? Where is discussion?
Where is learning to talk?
You know, we have to change it.
I work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem.
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating.
We have to teach kids that Coke and Pop Tarts aren't breakfast.
We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar, they go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack.
And we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools.
We have recycling in all of our schools.
You know, the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important, we have to teach kids about in school.
It has to be so much a part of them that they really get it.
Because, you know what, many of us are sort of at the end of our careers, and we need to be giving these kids -- these young kids, the next generation -- the tools to save themselves and save the planet.
One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships.
I work with private companies who are willing to do R &amp; D with me, who are willing to do distribution for me, who are really willing to work to go into schools.
Schools are underfunded.
Most schools in America spend less than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child.
That comes down to under five dollars an hour.
Most of you spend 10, 15 dollars an hour for babysitters when you have them.
So we're spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system.
And if we're going to change it, and change how we feed kids, we really have to rethink that.
So, public and private partnerships, advocacy groups, working with foundations.
In our school district, the way we afford this is our school district allocates .03 percent of the general fund towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district allocated a half to one percent, we could start to really fix this program.
We really need to change it.
It's going to take more money.
Of course, it's not all about food; it's also about kids getting exercise.
And one of the simple things we can do is put recess before lunch.
It's sort of this "duh" thing.
You know, if you have kids coming into lunch and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess, you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside.
And then, at one in the afternoon, they're totally crashing.
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch.
So if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class, believe me, they're going to sit there and eat their lunch.
We need to -- we need to educate.
We need to educate the kids.
We need to educate the staff.
I had 90 employees.
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could.
And, you know, I'm not that better off now.
But we really have to educate.
We have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again, because, of course, they don't -- because we've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long.
We need 40-minute lunches -- most schools have 20-minute lunches -- and lunches that are time-appropriate.
There was just a big study done, and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning.
That is not lunchtime.
You know, it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing.
And just remember, at very least tacitly, this is what we're teaching children as what they should be doing.
I think if we're going to fix this, one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program.
Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA, I think it should be under CDC.
If we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative, and we started thinking about food as health, then I think we wouldn't have corn dogs as lunch.
Okay, Finance 101 on this, and this -- I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece, because I think this is something we all have to understand.
The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars feeding 30 million children a year.
That number probably needs to double.
People say, "Oh my God, where are we going to get 8 billion?"
In this country, we're spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food.
We spend 100 billion dollars a year on diet aids.
We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables, which is why we need all the diet aids.
We spend 200 billion dollars a year on diet-related illness today, with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes.
200 billion.
So you know what, when we talk about needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot.
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- that's what the government allocates for lunch.
Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead.
That means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools -- most schools, 80 to 90 cents. In L.A., it's 56 cents.
So we're spending less than a dollar, OK, on lunch.
Now I don't know about you, but I go to Starbucks and Pete's and places like that, and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars.
One gourmet coffee, one, is more -- we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week in our schools.
You know what? We should be ashamed.
We, as a country, should be ashamed at that.
The richest country.
In our country, it's the kids that need it the most, who get this really, really lousy food.
It's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can't even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food.
And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick.
Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of.
We can all make a difference.
That every single one of us, whether we have children, whether we care about children, whether we have nieces or nephews, or anything -- that we can make a difference.
Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids, whether you take your kids, or grandchildren, or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them.
Sit down and care.
And on the macro level, we're in what seems to be a 19-month presidential campaign, and of all the things we're asking all of these potential leaders, what about asking for the health of our children?
Thank you.

Everything is interconnected.
As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.
We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York.
When I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.
There were no clouds in the sky.
And after a while I began to perspire.
And he pointed up to the sky, and he said, "Look, do you see that?
That's part of you up there.
That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals."
In my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life, I started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that."
And so three days later, driving very fast, I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell, capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes, although only two percent actually do.
These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.
They can grow so big, blocking all daylight, making it very dark and ominous standing under them.
Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.
There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.
And then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues.
I've learned to respect the lightning.
My hair used to be straight.
I'm just kidding.
What really excites me about these storms is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate, with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.
They become lovely monsters.
When I'm photographing them, I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.
As I stand under them, I see not just a cloud, but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun and even this very planet.
All my relations. Thank you.

My travels to Afghanistan began many, many years ago on the eastern border of my country, my homeland, Poland.
I was walking through the forests of my grandmother's tales.
A land where every field hides a grave, where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century.
Behind the destruction, I found a soul of places.
I met humble people.
I heard their prayer and ate their bread.
Then I have been walking East for 20 years -- from Eastern Europe to Central Asia -- through the Caucasus Mountains, Middle East, North Africa, Russia.
And I ever met more humble people.
And I shared their bread and their prayer.
This is why I went to Afghanistan.
One day, I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River.
I was alone on foot.
And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport.
But he gave me a cup of tea.
And I understood that his surprise was my protection.
So I have been walking and traveling, by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking, from Iran's border to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor.
And in this way I could find noor, the hidden light of Afghanistan.
My only weapon was my notebook and my Leica.
I heard prayers of the Sufi -- humble Muslims, hated by the Taliban.
Hidden river, interconnected with the mysticism from Gibraltar to India.
The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears, and welcomed as a gift.
What do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect, about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium?
These are opium-addicted people on the roofs of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war.
These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen.
What do we know about the women 10 years after the war?
Clothed in this nylon bag, made in China, with the name of burqa.
I saw one day, the largest school in Afghanistan, a girls' school.
13,000 girls studying here in the rooms underground, full of scorpions.
And their love [for studying] was so big that I cried.
What do we know about the death threats by the Taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh?
The region is not secure, but full of the Taliban, and they did it.
My aim is to give a voice to the silent people, to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game, the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict.
Thanks.

What I want you all to do right now is to think of this mammal that I'm going to describe to you.
The first thing I'm going to tell you about this mammal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly.
If we remove this mammal from our ecosystems, they simply will not work.
That's the first thing.
The second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities of this mammal, if we study this mammal, we're going to get great insight into our diseases of the senses, such as blindness and deafness.
And the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal is that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies deep within its DNA.
So are you all thinking?
So, magnificent creature, isn't it?
Who here thought of a bat?
Ah, I can see half the audience agrees with me, and I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you.
So I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals.
One fifth of all living mammals is a bat, and they have very unique attributes.
Bats as we know them have been around on this planet for about 64 million years.
One of the most unique things that bats do as a mammal is that they fly.
Now flight is an inherently difficult thing.
Flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times: once in the bats, once in the birds, and once in the pterodactyls.
And so with flight, it's very metabolically costly.
Bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this.
But one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment. They use echolocation.
Now, what I mean by echolocation -- they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose. This sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment, and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image.
And this enables them to orient in complete darkness.
Indeed, they do look very strange. We're humans.
We're a visual species. When scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night, we didn't believe it.
For a hundred years, despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing, we didn't believe it.
Now, if you look at this bat, it looks a little bit alien.
Indeed, the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel once said, "To truly experience an alien life form on this planet, you should lock yourself inside a room with a flying, echolocating bat in complete darkness."
And if you look at the actual physical characteristics on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat, you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated to be able to make sound and perceive it.
Very big ears, strange nose leaves, but teeny-tiny eyes.
So again, if you just look at this bat, you realize sound is very important for its survival.
Most bats look like the previous one.
However, there are a group that do not use echolocation.
They do not perceive their environment using sound, and these are the flying foxes.
If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia, you've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and if you just look at their face, you can see they have much, much larger eyes and much smaller ears.
So among and within bats is a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception.
Now this is going to be important for what I'm going to tell you later during the talk.
Now, if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you, and I know some people probably are feeling a little sick looking at very large images of bats, that's probably not that surprising, because here in Western culture, bats have been demonized.
Really, of course the famous book "Dracula," written by a fellow Northside Dubliner Bram Stoker, probably is mainly responsible for this.
However, I also think it's got to do with the fact that bats come out at night, and we don't really understand them. We're a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us.
Bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events.
They are the perpetrators in horror movies, such as this famous "Nightwing."
Also, if you think about it, demons always have bat wings, whereas birds, they typically -- or angels have bird wings.
Now, this is Western society, and what I hope to do tonight is to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture, that they perceive bats as creatures that bring good luck, and indeed, if you walk into a Chinese home, you may see an image such as this.
This is considered the Five Blessings.
The Chinese word for "bat" sounds like the Chinese word for "happiness," and they believe that bats bring wealth, health, longevity, virtue and serenity.
And indeed, in this image, you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five bats.
And what I want to do tonight is to talk to you and to show you that at least three of these blessings are definitely represented by a bat, and that if we study bats we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings.
So, wealth -- how can a bat possibly bring us wealth?
Now as I said before, bats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly. And why is this?
Bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants.
They also feed on fruit, and they disperse the seeds of these fruits. Bats are responsible for pollinating the tequila plant, and this is a multi-million dollar industry in Mexico. So indeed, we need them for our ecosystems to function properly.
Without them, it's going to be a problem.
But most bats are voracious insect predators.
It's been estimated in the U.S., in a tiny colony of big brown bats, that they will feed on over a million insects a year, and in the United States of America, right now bats are being threatened by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.
It's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out populations of bats, and scientists have estimated that 1,300 metric tons of insects a year are now remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats.
Bats are also threatened in the U.S.
by their attraction to wind farms. Again, right now bats are looking at a little bit of a problem.
They're going to -- They are very threatened in the United States of America alone.
Now how can this help us?
Well, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation, we're going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops.
And for one year in the U.S. alone, it's estimated that it's going to cost 22 billion U.S. dollars, if we remove bats. So indeed, bats then do bring us wealth.
They maintain the health of our ecosystems, and also they save us money.
So again, that's the first blessing. Bats are important for our ecosystems.
And what about the second? What about health?
Inside every cell in your body lies your genome.
Your genome is made up of your DNA, your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function and interact and be as you are.
Now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies, it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome in a very rapid time and at a very, very reduced cost.
Now when we've been doing this, we've realized that there's variations within our genome.
So I want you to look at the person beside you.
Just have a quick look. And what we need to realize is that every 300 base pairs in your DNA, you're a little bit different.
And one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases, or does this variation just make you different?
Again, what does it mean here? What does this variation actually mean? So if we are to capitalize on all of this new molecular data and personalized genomic information that is coming online that we will be able to have in the next few years, we have to be able to differentiate between the two. So how do we do this?
Well, I believe we just look at nature's experiments.
So through natural selection, over time, mutations, variations that disrupt the function of a protein will not be tolerated over time.
Evolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation.
And so therefore, if you look at the same region of a genome in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent, you will get a better understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is, i.e., if it is important for the mammal to function, for its survival, it will be the same in all of those different lineages, species, taxa.
So therefore, if we were to do this, what we'd need to do is sequence that region in all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same or if it's different. So if it is the same, this indicates that that site is important for a function, so a disease mutation should fall within that site.
So in this case here, if all the mammals that we look at have a yellow-type genome at that site, it probably suggests that purple is bad.
This could be even more powerful if you look at mammals that are doing things slightly differently.
So say, for example, the region of the genome that I was looking at was a region that's important for vision.
If we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well, such as bats, and we find that bats that don't see so well have the purple type, we know that this is probably what's causing this disease.
So in my lab, we've been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of the senses.
We're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this?
Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired, and 45 million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem, and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases, so we want to try and better understand which mutations in the gene cause the disease.
Also we look at deafness. One in every 1,000 newborn babies are deaf, and when we reach 80, over half of us will also have a hearing problem.
Again, there's many underlying genetic causes for this.
is looking at these unique sensory specialists, the bats, and we have looked at genes that cause blindness when there's a defect in them, genes that cause deafness when there's a defect in them, and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease.
So bats are also important for our health, to enable us to better understand how our genome functions.
So this is where we are right now, but what about the future?
What about longevity?
This is where we're going to go, and as I said before, I really believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies within the bat genome.
So why should we be interested in aging at all?
Well, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered one of the most familiar, yet the least well-understood, aspects of all of biology, and really, since the dawn of civilization, mankind has sought to avoid it.
But we are going to have to understand it a bit better.
In Europe alone, by 2050, there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65, and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80.
As we age, we deteriorate, and this deterioration causes problems for our society, so we have to address it.
So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome? Does anybody want to hazard a guess over how long this bat could live for?
Who -- put up your hands -- who says two years?
Nobody? One? How about 10 years?
Some? How about 30?
How about 40? Okay, it's a whole varied response.
This bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest-living bat.
It lived for up to 42 years, and this bat's still alive in the wild today.
But what would be so amazing about this?
Well, typically, in mammals there is a relationship between body size, metabolic rate, and how long you can live for, and you can predict how long a mammal can live for given its body size.
So typically, small mammals live fast, die young.
Think of a mouse. But bats are very different.
As you can see here on this graph, in blue, these are all other mammals, but bats can live up to nine times longer than expected despite having a really, really high metabolic rate, and the question is, how can they do that?
There are 19 species of mammal that live longer than expected, given their body size, than man, and 18 of those are bats.
So therefore, they must have something within their DNA that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses, particularly of flight. They expend three times more energy than a mammal of the same size, but don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects.
So right now, in my lab, we're combining state-of-the-art bat field biology, going out and catching the long-lived bats, with the most up-to-date, modern molecular technology to understand better what it is that they do to stop aging as we do.
And hopefully in the next five years, I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that.
Aging is a big problem for humanity, and I believe that by studying bats, we can uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals to achieve extraordinary longevity. If we find out what they're doing, perhaps through gene therapy, we can enable us to do the same thing.
Potentially, this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it.
Just imagine what that would be like.
So really, I don't think we should be thinking of them as flying demons of the night, but more as our superheroes.
And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit if we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem, they allow us to understand how our genome functions, and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth.
So tonight, when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies, and you see this beautiful flying mammal, I want you to smile. Thank you.

This story is about taking imagination seriously.
Fourteen years ago, I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet, used the same way for centuries.
Today, I'm using it to create permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world.
I was an unlikely person to be doing this.
I never studied sculpture, engineering or architecture.
In fact, after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven.
I went off on my own to become an artist, and I painted for 10 years, when I was offered a Fulbright to India.
Promising to give exhibitions of paintings, I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.
The deadline for the show arrived -- my paints didn't.
I had to do something.
This fishing village was famous for sculpture.
So I tried bronze casting.
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.
I went for a walk on the beach, watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.
I'd seen it every day, but this time I saw it differently -- a new approach to sculpture, a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials.
My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen.
It's a self-portrait titled "Wide Hips."
We hoisted them on poles to photograph.
I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns.
I was mesmerized.
I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans, next in Lithuania with lace makers.
I liked the fine detail it gave my work, but I wanted to make them larger -- to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in.
Returning to India to work with those fishermen, we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots -- installed briefly in Madrid.
Thousands of people saw it, and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto, Portugal.
He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city.
I didn't know if I could do that and preserve my art.
Durable, engineered, permanent -- those are in opposition to idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral.
For two years, I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays, salt, air, pollution, and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind.
We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle.
So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring.
We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds.
But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving.
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel.
He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement.
I couldn't build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren't going to withstand a hurricane.
So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory, learned the variables of their machines, and figured out a way to make lace with them.
There was no language to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce.
So we had to create one.
Three years and two children later, we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.
It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built, permanent and had lost nothing in translation.
This intersection had been bland and anonymous.
Now it had a sense of place.
I walked underneath it for the first time.
As I watched the wind's choreography unfold, I felt sheltered and, at the same time, connected to limitless sky.
My life was not going to be the same.
I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world.
I'm going to share two directions that are new in my work.
Historic Philadelphia City Hall: its plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting.
So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing, discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet.
I'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time -- like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding.
Next challenge, the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked, could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture?
I didn't know where to begin, but I said yes.
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean.
It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates, sped up the planet's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day.
So I contacted NOAA, and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami, and translated it into this.
Its title: "1.26" refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth's day was shortened.
I couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.
Its shape was too complex now.
So I replaced the metal armature with a soft, fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.
The sculpture could now be entirely soft, which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings -- literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.
There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity.
So we had to create it.
Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line.
This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers.
They don't have funding yet, but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they're most needed.
Fourteen years ago, I searched for beauty in the traditional things, in craft forms.
Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous, billowing forms the scale of buildings.
My artistic horizons continue to grow.
I'll leave you with this story.
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix.
An attorney in the office who'd never been interested in art, never visited the local art museum, dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.
There they were in their business suits, laying in the grass, noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn't know, sharing the rediscovery of wonder.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

What would be a good end of life?
And I'm talking about the very end.
I'm talking about dying.
We all think a lot about how to live well.
I'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well.
I'm not a geriatrician.
I design reading programs for preschoolers.
What I know about this topic comes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two.
In the last few years, I helped two friends have the end of life they wanted.
Jim and Shirley Modini spent their 68 years of marriage living off the grid on their 1,700-acre ranch in the mountains of Sonoma County.
They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge for the bears and lions and so many other things that lived there.
This was their dream.
I met Jim and Shirley in their 80s.
They were both only children who chose not to have kids.
As we became friends, I became their trustee and their medical advocate, but more importantly, I became the person who managed their end-of-life experiences.
And we learned a few things about how to have a good end.
In their final years, Jim and Shirley faced cancers, fractures, infections, neurological illness.
It's true.
At the end, our bodily functions and independence are declining to zero.
What we found is that, with a plan and the right people, quality of life can remain high.
The beginning of the end is triggered by a mortality awareness event, and during this time, Jim and Shirley chose ACR nature preserves to take their ranch over when they were gone.
This gave them the peace of mind to move forward.
It might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition.
But one day, you're going to say, "This thing is going to get me."
Jim and Shirley spent this time letting friends know that their end was near and that they were okay with that.
Dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness are different.
In both cases, last days are about quiet reassurance.
Jim died first. He was conscious until the very end, but on his last day he couldn't talk.
Through his eyes, we knew when he needed to hear again, "It is all set, Jim. We're going to take care of Shirley right here at the ranch, and ACR's going to take care of your wildlife forever."
From this experience I'm going to share five practices.
I've put worksheets online, so if you'd like, you can plan your own end.
It starts with a plan.
Most people say, "I'd like to die at home."
Eighty percent of Americans die in a hospital or a nursing home.
Saying we'd like to die at home is not a plan.
A lot of people say, "If I get like that, just shoot me."
This is not a plan either; this is illegal.
A plan involves answering straightforward questions about the end you want.
Where do you want to be when you're no longer independent?
What do you want in terms of medical intervention?
And who's going to make sure your plan is followed?
You will need advocates.
Having more than one increases your chance of getting the end you want.
Don't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child.
You want someone who has the time and proximity to do this job well, and you want someone who can work with people under the pressure of an ever-changing situation.
Hospital readiness is critical.
You are likely to be headed to the emergency room, and you want to get this right.
Prepare a one-page summary of your medical history, medications and physician information.
Put this in a really bright envelope with copies of your insurance cards, your power of attorney, and your do-not-resuscitate order.
Have advocates keep a set in their car.
Tape a set to your refrigerator.
When you show up in the E.R. with this packet, your admission is streamlined in a material way.
You're going to need caregivers.
You'll need to assess your personality and financial situation to determine whether an elder care community or staying at home is your best choice.
In either case, do not settle.
We went through a number of not-quite-right caregivers before we found the perfect team led by Marsha, who won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you when you can't get out there, and Caitlin, who won't let you skip your morning exercises but knows when you need to hear that your wife is in good hands.
Finally, last words.
What do you want to hear at the very end, and from whom would you like to hear it?
In my experience, you'll want to hear that whatever you're worried about is going to be fine.
When you believe it's okay to let go, you will.
So, this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial.
What I've learned is if we put some time into planning our end of life, we have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life.
Here are Jim and Shirley just after deciding who would take care of their ranch.
Here's Jim just a few weeks before he died, celebrating a birthday he didn't expect to see.
And here's Shirley just a few days before she died being read an article in that day's paper about the significance of the wildlife refuge at the Modini ranch.
Jim and Shirley had a good end of life, and by sharing their story with you, I hope to increase our chances of doing the same.
Thank you.

Allison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it?
No, you can't start the three minutes.
Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair.
AH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here.
I mean I'm nervous enough as it is.
But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago.
Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery.
Do you know that surgery?
Electric saw, power drill, totally disgusting unless you're David Bolinsky, in which case it's all truth and beauty.
Sure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty.
Anyway, I did have a really big epiphany around the situation, so Chris invited me to tell you about it.
But first you need to know two things about me.
Just two things.
I'm Canadian, and I'm the youngest of seven kids.
Now, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system.
That means we get our new hips for free.
And being the youngest of seven, I have never been at the front of the line for anything. OK?
So my hip had been hurting me for years.
I finally went to the doctor, which was free.
And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free.
Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year.
That is what free gets you.
I met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays, and I got a good look at them. And you know, even I could tell my hip was bad, and I actually work in marketing.
So he said, "Allison, we've got to get you on the table.
I'm going to replace your hip -- it's about an 18-month wait."
18 more months.
I'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months.
You know, it's such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs.
I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED.
I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa.
I would not have my new hip for TED2008.
I would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing.
So, I left his office and I was walking through the hospital, and that's when I had my epiphany.
This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line.
Oh yeah.
Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is?
We do not think that way.
We don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration.
In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.
"After you." "Oh, no, no. After you."
Hey, are you from Canada? "Oh, me too! Hi!"
"Great! Excellent!"
So no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list.
Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing, or gardening.
No, no. Front of the line.
So by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt, because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign.
And I saw a sign.
In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said, "Volunteers Needed." Hmm.
Well, they signed me up immediately.
No reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no.
They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.
Yeah. They needed some young blood.
So, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest, I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.
I worked alone.
Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop.
While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs, I'd casually ask, "What do you do?"
Then I'd tell them, "Well, I'm getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months.
It's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow!"
All the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer.
My next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally, right after a shift at the gift shop.
So, naturally, I had my vest and my identification.
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office.
And you know, when he walked in, I could just tell that he saw them.
Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away, and a big fat prescription for Percocet.
Now, word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line.
And, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that.
Two reasons.
First of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip.
But also I intend to stick with the volunteering, which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.
Even when a Canadian cheats the system, they do it in a way that benefits society.

<title>Allison Hunt: How to get hip</title>
<description>When Allison Hunt found out that she needed a new hip -- and that Canada's national health care system would require her to spend nearly 2 years on a waiting list -- she took matters into her own hands.</description>
<keywords>culture,health care,marketing,medicine,short talk</keywords>

So this is a story of a place that I now call home.
It's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both.
So this is Bertie County, North Carolina, USA.
To give you an idea of the "where:" So here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in, Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state.
It's about two hours east driving-time from Raleigh.
And it's very flat. It's very swampy.
It's mostly farmland.
The entire county is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed.
So there's only 27 people per square mile, which comes down to about 10 people per square kilometer.
Bertie County is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural America.
We've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the American borders.
We know the symptoms.
It's the hollowing out of small towns.
It's downtowns becoming ghost towns.
The brain drain -- where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back.
It's the dependence on farm subsidies and under-performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban.
And Bertie County is no exception to this.
Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with, like many communities similar to it, is that there's no shared, collective investment in the future of rural communities.
Only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now benefits rural communities, and yet 20 percent of our population lives there.
So Bertie County is not only very rural; it's incredibly poor.
It is the poorest county in the state.
It has one in three of its children living in poverty, and it's what is referred to as a "rural ghetto."
The economy is mostly agricultural.
The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco, and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut.
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant.
The county seat is Windsor.
This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now.
It's home to only 2,000 people, and like a lot of other small towns it has been hollowed out over the years.
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use.
You can count the number of restaurants in the county on one hand -- Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite.
But in the whole county there is no coffee shop, there's no Internet cafe, there's no movie theater, there's no bookstore.
There isn't even a Walmart.
Racially, the county is about 60 percent African American, but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private Lawrence Academy.
So the public school students are about 86 percent African American.
And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class, and you can see the difference is pretty stark.
So to say that the public education system in Bertie County is struggling would be a huge understatement.
There's basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from, and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor's degree or higher.
So there isn't a big legacy in the pride of education.
In fact, two years ago, only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders were passing the state standard in both English and math.
So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place, but I promise there is good news.
The biggest asset, in my opinion, one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man: This is Dr. Chip Zullinger, fondly known as Dr. Z.
He was brought in in October 2007 to basically fix this broken school system.
And he previously was a superintendent in Charleston, South Carolina and then in Denver, Colorado.
He started some of the country's first charter schools in the late '80s in the U.S.
And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary, and he is the reason that I now live and work there.
So in February of 2009, Dr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design -- which is a non-profit design firm that I founded -- to come to Bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district.
And he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process -- one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don't usually have access to design services or creative capital.
Specifically, we use these six design directives, probably the most important being number two: we design with, not for -- in that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design, it's not about designing for clients anymore.
It's about designing with people, and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within.
So at the time of being invited down there, we were based in San Francisco, and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of 2009, spending about half our time in Bertie County.
And when I say we, I mean Project H, but more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller, who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder.
So fast-forward to today, and we now live there.
I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo, because he would kill me if he knew I was using it because of the sweatsuits.
But this is our front porch. We live there.
We now call this place home.
Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth, we realized we had fallen in love with the place.
We had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we're able to do in a rural place like Bertie County, that, as designers and builders, you can't do everywhere.
There's space to experiment and to weld and to test things.
We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger.
There's a nobility of real, hands-on, dirt-under-your-fingernails work.
But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there, there is a huge need.
There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County.
There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county.
And so we saw an opportunity to bring design as this untouched tool, something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have, and to be sort of the -- to usher that in as a new type of tool in their tool kit.
The initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger -- that was why we were there.
But beyond that, we recognized that Bertie County, as a community, was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking.
So the goal became, yes, to apply design within education, but then to figure out how to make education a great vehicle for community development.
So in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education.
And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County, but I feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the U.S. and maybe even beyond.
So the first of the three is design for education.
This is the most kind of direct, obvious intersection of the two things.
It's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students.
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days.
And so this played out for us in a couple different ways.
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs.
So traditionally, the computer labs, particularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County, where they have to benchmark test every other week, the computer lab is a kill-and-drill testing facility.
You come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave.
So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology, to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging, more accessible, and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology-based instruction.
So this is the lab at the high school, and the principal there is in love with this room.
Every time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them.
And this also meant the co-creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape.
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid.
So this game that the kids are playing here -- in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called Match Me.
And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams, one team on each side of the playground, and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires.
And then she'll call out a math problem -- so let's say four times four -- and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is 16 and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it.
So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins.
And the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing.
Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores, a greater comfort level with the material, especially with the boys, that in going outside and playing, they aren't afraid to take on a double-digit multiplication problem -- and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material.
So with design for education, I think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers, so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them.
So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent.
He came out for one of our teacher-training days and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself.
So the second approach is redesigning education itself.
This is the most complex.
It's a systems-level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom.
So in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change, which is easier said than done in rural communities and in inside-the-box education systems in rural communities.
So for us, this was a graphic public campaign called Connect Bertie.
There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county.
And this was for a fund that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system.
Right now I should say, there are only 10 percent of the houses that actually have an in-home Internet connection.
And the only places to get WiFi are in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint, which I find myself squatting outside of a lot.
Aside from, you know, getting people excited and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place, it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community.
It asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community's development.
So the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer, and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day.
And then the third approach, which is what I'm most excited about, which is where we are now, is: design as education.
So "design as education" means that we could actually teach design within public schools, and not design-based learning -- not like "let's learn physics by building a rocket," but actually learning design-thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose.
It also means that designers are no longer consultants, but we're teachers, and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation.
And what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by.
It's hands-on, it's in-your-face, it requires an active engagement, and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways.
So we started thinking about the legacy of shop class and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular -- historically, has been something intended for kids who aren't going to go to college.
It's a vocational training path.
It's working-class; it's blue-collar.
The projects are things like, let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas.
And in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely.
So we thought, what if you could bring back shop class, but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed, and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process.
So we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one-year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class.
And so this starts in four weeks, at the end of the summer, and my partner and I, Matthew and I, just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it.
And this is what it looks like.
So over the course of two semesters, the Fall and the Spring, the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4,500 square foot studio/shop space.
And during that time, they're doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding, coming back into the studio, doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work, and then moving into the shop and actually testing them, building them, prototyping them, figuring out if they are going to work and refining that.
And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job.
They're paid as employees of Project H to be the construction crew with us to build these projects in the community.
So the first project, which will be built next summer, is an open-air farmers' market downtown, followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year.
So these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say, "I built that, and I'm proud of it."
So I want you to meet three of our students.
This is Ryan.
She is 15 years old.
She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher.
She wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County, because that's where her family is from, where she calls home, and she feels very strongly about giving back to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in.
So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way.
This is Eric. He plays for the football team.
He is really into dirtbike racing, and he wants to be an architect.
So for him, Studio H offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect, everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client.
And then this is Anthony.
He is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands, and so for him, Studio H means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands-on engagement.
He's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure, so if he ends up not going to college, he will have developed some industry-relevant skills.
What design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom.
So this building downtown, which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market, is now the classroom.
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that's a homework assignment.
And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public -- that's the final exam.
And for the community, what design and building offers is real, visible, built progress.
It's one project per year, and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future.
So we recognize that Studio H, especially in its first year, is a small story -- 13 students, it's two teachers, it's one project in one place.
But we feel like this could work in other places.
And I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story, because it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale.
Because, when you zoom out that far, you lose the ability to view people as humans.
Ultimately, design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers.
And let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves.
We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter, we need to work outside of our comfort zones more, and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard.
So while this is a very small story, we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design.
Thank you.

<description>Designer Emily Pilloton moved to rural Bertie County, in North Carolina, to engage in a bold experiment of design-led community transformation. She's teaching a design-build class called Studio H that engages high schoolers' minds and bodies while bringing smart design and new opportunities to the poorest county in the state.</description>
<keywords>design,education,poverty</keywords>

If you are a blind child in India, you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news.
The first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none, and that's because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults, and there are very, very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children.
In fact, if you were to be treated, you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from Rajasthan illustrates.
This is a three-year-old orphan girl who had cataracts.
So, her caretakers took her to the village medicine man, and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital, the person decided to burn her abdomen with red-hot iron bars to drive out the demons.
The second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by neuroscientists, who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age, that even if you have your eye corrected, the chances of your brain learning how to see are very, very slim -- again, slim or none.
So when I heard these two things, it troubled me deeply, both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons.
So let me first start with the personal reason.
It'll sound corny, but it's sincere.
That's my son, Darius.
As a new father, I have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are, what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child.
I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius, and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment, that's just viscerally wrong.
So that's the personal reason.
Scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods -- that if the brain is older than four or five years of age, it loses its ability to learn -- that doesn't sit well with me, because I don't think that idea has been tested adequately.
The birth of the idea is from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work, two researchers who were at Harvard, and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their studies of visual physiology, which are remarkably beautiful studies, but I believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely.
So, they did their work with kittens, with different kinds of deprivation regiments, and those studies, which date back to the '60s, are now being applied to human children.
So I felt that I needed to do two things.
One: provide care to children who are currently being deprived of treatment.
That's the humanitarian mission.
And the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity.
And these two missions, as you can tell, thread together perfectly. One adds to the other; in fact, one would be impossible without the other.
So, to implement these twin missions, a few years ago, I launched Project Prakash.
Prakash, as many of you know, is the Sanskrit word for light, and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children, we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience.
And the logo -- even though it looks extremely Irish, it's actually derived from the Indian symbol of Diya, an earthen lamp.
The Prakash, the overall effort has three components: outreach, to identify children in need of care; medical treatment; and in subsequent study.
And I want to show you a short video clip that illustrates the first two components of this work.
This is an outreach station conducted at a school for the blind.
Pawan Sinha: So, because this is a school for the blind, many children have permanent conditions.
That's a case of microphthalmos, which is malformed eyes, and that's a permanent condition; it cannot be treated.
That's an extreme of micropthalmos called enophthalmos.
But, every so often, we come across children who show some residual vision, and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable.
So, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital.
That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi, the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital.
It has a very well-equipped pediatric ophthalmic center, which was made possible in part by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity.
So, eating burgers actually helps.
(Text: Such examinations allow us to improve eye-health in many children, and ...
... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.) PS: So, as I zoom in to the eyes of this child, you will see the cause of his blindness.
The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts, so opacities of the lens.
In our eyes, the lens is clear, but in this child, the lens has become opaque, and therefore he can't see the world.
So, the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye.
Here's the eye with the opaque lens, the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted.
And here's the same child three weeks post-operation, with the right eye open.
Thank you.
So, even from that little clip, you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible, and we have now provided treatment to over 200 children, and the story repeats itself.
After treatment, the child gains significant functionality.
In fact, the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation.
We did a paper a few years ago about this woman that you see on the right, SRD, and she got her sight late in life, and her vision is remarkable at this age.
I should add a tragic postscript to this -- she died two years ago in a bus accident.
So, hers is just a truly inspiring story -- unknown, but inspiring story.
So when we started finding these results, as you might imagine, it created quite a bit of stir in the scientific and the popular press.
Here's an article in Nature that profiled this work, and another one in Time.
So, we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced -- that recovery is feasible, despite extended visual deprivation.
The next obvious question to ask: What is the process of recovery?
So, the way we study that is, let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity.
The child is provided treatment, and I want to stress that the treatment is completely unconditional; there is no quid pro quo.
We treat many more children then we actually work with.
Every child who needs treatment is treated.
After treatment, about every week, we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line.
And we try to do this for as long as possible.
This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up.
What might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones?
And we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies, but I want to highlight one particular one, and that is image parsing into objects.
So, any image of the kind that you see on the left, be it a real image or a synthetic image, it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column, regions of different colors, different luminances.
The brain has this complex task of putting together, integrating, subsets of these regions into something that's more meaningful, into what we would consider to be objects, as you see on the right.
And nobody knows how this integration happens, and that's the question we asked with Project Prakash.
So, here's what happens very soon after the onset of sight.
Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago, and you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT, running the experiment with him.
His visual-motor coordination is quite poor, but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out.
If you show him real world images, if you show others like him real world images, they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over-fragmented; it's made up of a collage, a patchwork, of regions of different colors and luminances.
And that's what's indicated in the green outlines.
When you ask them, "Even if you can't name the objects, just point to where the objects are," these are the regions that they point to.
So the world is this complex patchwork of regions.
Even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object.
Interestingly enough, you give them a few months, and this is what happens.
Doctor: How many are these?
Patient: These are two things.
Doctor: What are their shapes?
Patient: Their shapes ...
This one is a circle, and this is a square.
PS: A very dramatic transformation has come about.
And the question is: What underlies this transformation?
It's a profound question, and what's even more amazing is how simple the answer is.
The answer lies in motion and that's what I want to show you in the next clip.
Doctor: What shape do you see here?
Patient: I can't make it out.
Doctor: Now?
Patient: Triangle.
Doctor: How many things are these?
Now, how many things are these?
Patient: Two.
Doctor: What are these things?
Patient: A square and a circle.
PS: And we see this pattern over and over again.
The one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information.
So the inference we are deriving from this, and several such experiments, is that dynamic information processing, or motion processing, serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing; it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition.
This simple idea has far reaching implications.
And let me just quickly mention two, one, drawing from the domain of engineering, and one from the clinic.
So, from the perspective of engineering, we can ask: Goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system, can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine-based vision systems that can learn on their own, that don't need to be programmed by a human programmer?
And that's what we're trying to do.
I'm at MIT, at MIT you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain.
So we are creating Dylan, which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive, and autonomously discovering: What are the objects in this visual input?
So, don't worry about the internals of Dylan.
Here, I'm just going to talk about how we test Dylan.
The way we test Dylan is by giving it inputs, as I said, of the same kind that a baby, or a child in Project Prakash would get.
But for a long time we couldn't quite figure out: Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs?
So, I thought, could we have Darius serve as our babycam carrier, and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan?
So that's what we did.
I had to have long conversations with my wife.
In fact, Pam, if you're watching this, please forgive me.
So, we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity.
As some of you might know, babyies are born pretty much legally blind.
Their acuity -- our acuity is 20/20; babies' acuity is like 20/800, so they are looking at the world in a very, very blurry fashion.
Here's what a baby-cam video looks like.
Thankfully, there isn't any audio to go with this.
What's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input, the baby, very quickly, is able to discover meaning in such input.
But then two or three days afterward, babies begin to pay attention to their mother's or their father's face.
How does that happen? We want Dylan to be able to do that, and using this mantra of motion, Dylan actually can do that.
So, given that kind of video input, with just about six or seven minutes worth of video, Dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces.
So, it's an important demonstration of the power of motion.
The clinical implication, it comes from the domain of autism.
Visual integration has been associated with autism by several researchers.
When we saw that, we asked: Could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath, of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?
Because, if that hypothesis were to be true, it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of the autism phenotype.
What you're going to see are video clips of two children -- one neurotypical, one with autism, playing Pong.
So, while the child is playing Pong, we are tracking where they're looking.
In red are the eye movement traces.
This is the neurotypical child, and what you see is that the child is able to make cues of the dynamic information to predict where the ball is going to go.
Even before the ball gets to a place, the child is already looking there.
Contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game.
Instead of anticipating, the child always follows where the ball has been.
The efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism.
So we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we'll have more results to report soon.
Looking ahead, if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we've treated so far, this is the magnitude of the problem.
The red dots are the children we have not treated.
So, there are many, many more children who need to be treated, and in order to expand the scope of the project, we are planning on launching The Prakash Center for Children, which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital, a school for the children we are treating and also a cutting-edge research facility.
The Prakash Center will integrate health care, education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts.
So, to summarize: Prakash, in its five years of existence, it's had an impact in multiple areas, ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain, to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism, the development of autonomous machine vision systems, education of the undergraduate and graduate students, and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness.
And for my students and I, it's been just a phenomenal experience because we have gotten to do interesting research, while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with.
Thank you very much.

Sheryl Shade: Hi, Aimee. Aimee Mullins: Hi.
SS: Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit, and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete.
AM: Well, for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio -- it might have given it away -- I'm a double amputee, and I was born without fibulas in both legs.
I was amputated at age one, and I've been running like hell ever since, all over the place.
SS: Well, why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown -- why don't we start there?
Why don't we start there?
AM: I'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program.
I won a full academic scholarship out of high school.
They pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs, and so I won a full ride to Georgetown and I've been there for four years. Love it.
SS: When Aimee got there, she decided that she's, kind of, curious about track and field, so she decided to call someone and start asking about it.
So, why don't you tell that story?
AM: Yeah. Well, I guess I've always been involved in sports.
I played softball for five years growing up.
I skied competitively throughout high school, and I got a little restless in college because I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise.
And I'd never competed on a disabled level, you know -- I'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes.
That's all I'd ever known.
In fact, I'd never even met another amputee until I was 17.
And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners, and I figured, "Oh, I don't know about this, but before I judge it, let me go see what it's all about."
So, I booked myself a flight to Boston in '95, 19 years old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before.
I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet to see how far I could run, and about 50 meters was enough for me, panting and heaving.
And I had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound, attached with Velcro straps -- big, thick, five-ply wool socks on -- you know, not the most comfortable things, but all I'd ever known.
And I'm up there in Boston against people wearing legs made of all things -- carbon graphite and, you know, shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things -- and they're all looking at me like, OK, we know who's not going to win this race.
And, I mean, I went up there expecting -- I don't know what I was expecting -- but, you know, when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump, hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet, two inches ...
Dan O'Brien jumped 5'11" in '96 in Atlanta, I mean, if it just gives you a comparison of -- these are truly accomplished athletes, without qualifying that word "athlete."
And so I decided to give this a shot: heart pounding, I ran my first race and I beat the national record-holder by three hundredths of a second, and became the new national record-holder on my first try out.
And, you know, people said, "Aimee, you know, you've got speed -- you've got natural speed -- but you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track.
You were all over the place.
We all saw how hard you were working."
And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown.
And I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world.
He's coached five Olympians, and the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling with All America certificates of all these athletes he's coached.
He's just a rather intimidating figure.
And I called him up and said, "Listen, I ran one race and I won ..."
"I want to see if I can, you know -- I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices, see what drills you do and whatever."
That's all I wanted -- just two practices.
"Can I just sit in and see what you do?"
And he said, "Well, we should meet first, before we decide anything."
You know, he's thinking, "What am I getting myself into?"
So, I met the man, walked in his office, and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached.
And we got to talking, and it turned out to be a great partnership because he'd never coached a disabled athlete, so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what I was or wasn't capable of, and I'd never been coached before.
So this was like, "Here we go -- let's start on this trip."
So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break, his free time, and I would come up to the track and train with him.
So that's how I met Frank.
That was fall of '95. But then, by the time that winter was rolling around, he said, "You know, you're good enough.
You can run on our women's track team here."
And I said, "No, come on."
And he said, "No, no, really. You can.
You can run with our women's track team."
In the spring of 1996, with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team that May coming up full speed, I joined the women's track team.
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level.
So I don't know, it started to become an interesting mix.
SS: Well, on your way to the Olympics, a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown.
Why don't you just tell them?
AM: Yes, well, you know, I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets -- everything I competed in -- and, you know, training in Georgetown and knowing that I was going to have to get used to seeing the backs of all these women's shirts -- you know, I'm running against the next Flo-Jo -- and they're all looking at me like, "Hmm, what's, you know, what's going on here?"
And putting on my Georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that, you know, in order to become better -- and I'm already the best in the country -- you know, you have to train with people who are inherently better than you.
And I went out there and made it to the Big East, which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season.
It was really, really hot.
And it's the first -- I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio, and I didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock -- it actually acted like a lubricant and I'd be, kind of, pistoning in the socket.
And at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint, in all my glory, I came out of my leg.
Like, I almost came out of it, in front of, like, 5,000 people.
And I, I mean, was just mortified -- because I was signed up for the 200, you know, which went off in a half hour.
I went to my coach: "Please, don't make me do this."
I can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off.
And if it came off at 85 there's no way I'm going 200 meters.
And he just sat there like this.
My pleas fell on deaf ears, thank god.
Because you know, the man is from Brooklyn; he's a big man. He says, "Aimee, so what if your leg falls off?
You pick it up, you put the damn thing back on, and finish the goddamn race!"
And I did. So, he kept me in line.
He kept me on the right track.
SS: So, then Aimee makes it to the 1996 Paralympics, and she's all excited. Her family's coming down -- it's a big deal.
It's now two years that you've been running?
AM: No, a year.
SS: A year. And why don't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race?
AM: Okay, well, Atlanta.
The Paralympics, just for a little bit of clarification, are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities -- amputees, persons with cerebral palsy, and wheelchair athletes -- as opposed to the Special Olympics, which deals with people with mental disabilities.
So, here we are, a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta, and I'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago, I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run 50 meters.
And so, here I am -- never lost.
I set new records at the U.S. Nationals -- the Olympic trials -- that May, and was sure that I was coming home with the gold.
I was also the only, what they call "bilateral BK" -- below the knee.
I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump.
I had just done the long jump, and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says, "How do you do that? You know, we're supposed to have a planar foot, so we can't get off on the springboard."
I said, "Well, I just did it. No one told me that."
So, it's funny -- I'm three inches within the world record -- and kept on from that point, you know, so I'm signed up in the long jump -- signed up?
No, I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter.
And I'm sure of it, you know?
I made the front page of my hometown paper that I delivered for six years, you know?
It was, like, this is my time for shine.
And we're at the trainee warm-up track, which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium.
These legs that I was on, which I'll take out right now -- I was the first person in the world on these legs.
I was the guinea pig., I'm telling you, this was, like -- talk about a tourist attraction.
Everyone was taking pictures -- "What is this girl running on?"
And I'm always looking around, like, where is my competition?
It's my first international meet.
I tried to get it out of anybody I could, you know, "Who am I running against here?"
"Oh, Aimee, we'll have to get back to you on that one."
I wanted to find out times.
"Don't worry, you're doing great."
This is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium, and they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look.
And my fastest time, which was the world record, was 15.77.
Then I'm looking: the next lane, lane two, is 12.8.
Lane three is 12.5. Lane four is 12.2. I said, "What's going on?"
And they shove us all into the shuttle bus, and all the women there are missing a hand.
So, I'm just, like -- they're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other,' you know?
I'm sitting there, like, "Oh, my god. Oh, my god."
You know, I'd never lost anything, like, whether it would be the scholarship or, you know, I'd won five golds when I skied. In everything, I came in first.
And Georgetown -- that was great.
I was losing, but it was the best training because this was Atlanta.
Here we are, like, crème de la crème, and there is no doubt about it, that I'm going to lose big.
And, you know, I'm just thinking, "Oh, my god, my whole family got in a van and drove down here from Pennsylvania."
And, you know, I was the only female U.S. sprinter.
So they call us out and, you know -- "Ladies, you have one minute."
And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd, like, the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see.
And I'm like, "I know! Look! This isn't right."
And I'm thinking that's my last card to play here; if I'm not going to beat these girls, I'm going to mess their heads a little, you know?
I mean, it was definitely the "Rocky IV" sensation of me versus Germany, and everyone else -- Estonia and Poland -- was in this heat.
And the gun went off, and all I remember was finishing last and fighting back tears of frustration and incredible -- incredible -- this feeling of just being overwhelmed.
And I had to think, "Why did I do this?"
If I had won everything -- but it was like, what was the point?
All this training -- I had transformed my life.
I became a collegiate athlete, you know. I became an Olympic athlete.
And it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there.
I mean, the fact that I set my sights, just a year and three months before, on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying, "Here's my life going in this direction -- and I want to take it here for a while, and just seeing how far I could push it."
And the fact that I asked for help -- how many people jumped on board?
How many people gave of their time and their expertise, and their patience, to deal with me?
And that was this collective glory -- that there was, you know, 50 people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta.
So, I apply this sort of philosophy now to everything I do: sitting back and realizing the progression, how far you've come at this day to this goal, you know.
It's important to focus on a goal, I think, but also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person.
That's the achievement, I think. That's the real achievement.
SS: Why don't you show them your legs?
AM: Oh, sure.
SS: You know, show us more than one set of legs.
AM: Well, these are my pretty legs.
No, these are my cosmetic legs, actually, and they're absolutely beautiful.
You've got to come up and see them.
There are hair follicles on them, and I can paint my toenails.
And, seriously, like, I can wear heels.
Like, you guys don't understand what that's like to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want.
SS: You got to pick your height?
AM: I got to pick my height, exactly.
Patrick Ewing, who played for Georgetown in the '80s, comes back every summer.
And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with foot injuries.
I'm like, "Get it off! Don't worry about it, you know.
You can be eight feet tall. Just take them off."
He didn't find it as humorous as I did, anyway.
OK, now, these are my sprinting legs, made of carbon graphite, like I said, and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket.
No, I've got so many legs in here.
These are -- do you want to hold that actually?
That's another leg I have for, like, tennis and softball.
It has a shock absorber in it so it, like, "Shhhh," makes this neat sound when you jump around on it. All right.
And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over, to keep it on. Which, when I sweat, you know, I'm pistoning out of it.
SS: Are you a different height?
AM: In these?
SS: In these.
AM: I don't know. I don't think so.
I may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on.
SS: She can't really stand on these legs. She has to be moving, so ...
AM: Yeah, I definitely have to be moving, and balance is a little bit of an art in them.
But without having the silicon sock, I'm just going to try slip in it.
And so, I run on these, and have shocked half the world on these.
These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run.
If you ever watch a sprinter, the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track.
So when I stand in these legs, my hamstring and my glutes are contracted, as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet.
AM: It's a company in San Diego called Flex-Foot.
And I was a guinea pig, as I hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out.
But actually these, like I said, are still the actual prototype.
I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at, they were everywhere. You know, it's like a big -- it's come full circle.
Moderator: Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED 2, and we'll talk about the design of them.
AM: Yes, we'll do that.
SS: Yes, there you go.
AM: So, these are the sprint legs, and I can put my other...
SS: Can you tell about who designed your other legs?
AM: Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth, England, about two hours south of London, and I'm the only person in the United States with these, which is a crime because they are so beautiful.
And I don't even mean, like, because of the toes and everything.
For me, while I'm such a serious athlete on the track, I want to be feminine off the track, and I think it's so important not to be limited in any capacity, whether it's, you know, your mobility or even fashion.
I mean, I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want -- the shoes I want, the skirts I want -- and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people.
They're also silicon.
This is a really basic, basic prosthetic limb under here.
It's like a Barbie foot under this.
It is. It's just stuck in this position, so I have to wear a two-inch heel.
And, I mean, it's really -- let me take this off so you can see it.
I don't know how good you can see it, but, like, it really is.
There're veins on the feet, and then my heel is pink, and my Achilles' tendon -- that moves a little bit.
And it's really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago.
And this is just a silicon piece of skin.
I mean, what happened was, two years ago this man in Belgium was saying, "God, if I can go to Madame Tussauds' wax museum and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes, looking so real as if she breathed, why can't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg, or an arm, or a hand?"
I mean, they make ears for burn victims.
They do amazing stuff with silicon.
SS: Two weeks ago, Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs.
And she came into town and she rushed around and she said, "I have to buy some new shoes!"
We're an hour before the ESPYs, and she thought she'd gotten a two-inch heel but she'd actually bought a three-inch heel.
AM: And this poses a problem for me, because it means I'm walking like that all night long.
SS: For 45 minutes. Luckily, the hotel was terrific.
They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes.
AM: I said to the receptionist -- I mean, I am just harried, and Sheryl's at my side -- I said, "Look, do you have anybody here who could help me?
Because I have this problem ... " You know, at first they were just going to write me off, like, "If you don't like your shoes, sorry. It's too late."
"No, no, no, no. I've got these special feet that need a two-inch heel. I have a three-inch heel.
I need a little bit off."
They didn't even want to go there.
They didn't even want to touch that one. They just did it.
No, these legs are great.
I'm actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some improvements.
I want to get legs like these made for flat feet so I can wear sneakers, because I can't with these ones.
So... Moderator: That's it.
SS: That's Aimee Mullins.

<title>Aimee Mullins: Changing my legs - and my mindset</title>
<description>In this archive video from 1998, paralympic sprinter Aimee Mullins talks about her record-setting career as a runner, and about the amazing carbon-fiber prosthetic legs that helped her cross the finish line.</description>
<keywords>beauty,design,prosthetics,sports,technology</keywords>

I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species.
The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious, and that's that our species, Homo sapiens, is actually really, really smart -- like, ridiculously smart -- like you're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now.
And this is, of course, not the first time you've probably recognized this.
Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.
So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.
You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral.
But of course, there's a second observation about the human species that I want to focus on a little bit more, and that's the fact that even though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart, we can also be incredibly, incredibly dumb when it comes to some aspects of our decision making.
Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.
Don't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes.
But of course, just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.
And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face.
We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create -- these markets that were supposed to be foolproof -- we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.
But both of these two embarrassing examples, I think, don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make, which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.
But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us, when put in certain contexts, will actually make very specific mistakes.
The errors we make are actually predictable.
We make them again and again.
And they're actually immune to lots of evidence.
When we get negative feedback, we still, the next time we're face with a certain context, tend to make the same errors.
And so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature.
What I'm most curious about is, how is a species that's as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time?
You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out?
In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?
And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.
One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.
Because we're a smart species, we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super, super complicated, sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand, even though we've actually created them.
We create financial markets that are super complex.
We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.
And of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it, in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up.
If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error.
We'd actually just say, okay, let's figure out the kinds of technologies we can't deal with, the kinds of environments that are bad -- get rid of those, design things better, and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be.
But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying, which is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.
Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly.
This is a hint that I've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way, over and over again.
It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways.
This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about, because, if it's us that's messed up, it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.
We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it.
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.
How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?
What we need is a population that's basically smart, can make lots of decisions, but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have, any of the things that might mess us up -- no human technology, human culture, maybe even not human language.
And so this is why we turned to these guys here.
These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.
These guys are New World primates, which means they broke off from the human branch about 35 million years ago.
This means that your great, great, great great, great, great -- with about five million "greats" in there -- grandmother was probably the same great, great, great, great grandmother with five million "greats" in there as Holly up here.
You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant, but albeit evolutionary, relative.
The good news about Holly though is that she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.
You know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well, but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.
So she's the perfect test case.
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans?
Does she make the same mistakes as us?
Does she not learn from them? And so on.
And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.
We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly, see if she messes these things up.
First problem is just, well, where should we start?
Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.
You know, where are we actually going to start with this?
And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse, around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news, we said, hhmm, maybe we should actually start in the financial domain.
Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.
Of course, that's when we hit a sort second problem -- a little bit more methodological -- which is that, maybe you guys don't know, but monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.
But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff.
So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.
How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they don't actually use it?
So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money.
So that's just what we did.
What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non-human currency.
We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies, so we just called it a token.
But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale to actually use with humans, to actually buy different pieces of food.
It doesn't look like much -- in fact, it isn't like much.
Like most of our money, it's just a piece of metal.
As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know, once you get home, it's actually pretty useless.
It was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it.
When we first gave it to them in their enclosures, they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.
They were these kind of weird things.
But very quickly, the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food.
And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.
This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit curious about these things -- doesn't know.
There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter, and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.
Hands it over, and then gets some food.
It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman.
So here's just a quick video of what this looks like.
Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food.
Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.
But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.
So the monkeys get really good at this.
They're surprisingly good at this with very little training.
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own.
The question is: is this anything like human money?
Is this a market at all, or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick by getting monkeys to do something, looking smart, but not really being smart.
And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?
Well, you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.
You might have them start paying attention to price, paying attention to how much they buy -- sort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.
Do the monkeys do anything like this?
And so our monkey marketplace was born.
The way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.
When they get a hankering for some treats, we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.
Upon entering the market -- it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because, as the monkeys entered the door of the market, a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here -- two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from.
The salesmen were students from my lab.
They dressed differently; they were different people.
And over time, they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn, you know, who sold what at what price -- you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.
And you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.
and that's what the monkey can for a single token.
So everything costs one token, but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others, sometimes more grapes than others.
So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.
Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.
But here's Honey.
She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.
All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.
You can see Honey, very good market economist, goes with the guy who gives more.
She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.
So not just Honey, most of the monkeys went with guys who had more.
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.
When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.
They really cared about their monkey token dollar.
The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools, they basically matched, not just qualitatively, but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market.
So much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers, you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.
And what we'd really thought we'd done is like we'd actually introduced something that, at least for the monkeys and us, works like a real financial currency.
Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?
Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving -- you know, just like our own species.
The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else.
The other thing we also spontaneously saw, embarrassingly enough, is spontaneous evidence of larceny.
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity -- from each other, often from us -- you know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing, but things we spontaneously saw.
So we said, this looks bad.
Can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?
One possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out, you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.
We were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit.
So we said, let's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges, or certain kinds of economic experiments.
And so, since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself, I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.
So imagine that right now I handed each and every one of you a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.
Take these, put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.
Because it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.
Donate it, take it, and so on.
Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.
And here's your choice: you can either be risky, in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.
If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.
If it comes up tails, you get nothing.
So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.
Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.
I'm just going to give you 500 bucks.
You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.
So see what your intuition is here.
Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option.
Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?
This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.
You might say, eh, that's not really irrational.
People are a little risk-averse. So what?
Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently.
So now imagine that I give each and every one of you 2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.
Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.
Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.
And now imagine that I have you make another choice But this time, it's a little bit worse.
Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money, but you're going to get the same choice.
You can either take a risky loss -- so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.
If it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing -- or you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.
And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.
So maybe you're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this, which is when presented with these options, people don't choose to play it safe.
They actually tend to go a little risky.
The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations the same choice.
It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000, or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.
But people's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with.
So what's going on?
Well, it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.
You really have to do work to figure out, well, one option's a thousand, 2,000; one is 1,500.
Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another.
So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less."
This is all well and good, except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not.
And this leads to the second bias, which economists have called loss aversion.
The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.
We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.
And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this.
What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.
That means when we're in a risk mindset -- excuse me, when we're in a loss mindset, we actually become more risky, which can actually be really worrying.
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they're evaluating them in relative terms.
They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house -- because they don't want to sell at a loss.
The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases.
If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market, would they do the same thing as people?
And so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time -- or guys who were risky -- they did things differently half the time.
And then we gave them options that were bonuses -- like you guys did in the first scenario -- so they actually have a chance more, or pieces where they were experiencing losses -- they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.
And so this is what this looks like.
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape, so it looks pretty good.
But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.
The guy on the left is a safe bonus.
All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.
The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero.
Sometimes the monkeys get two extra.
For a big bonus, now they get three.
But this is the same choice you guys just faced.
Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial, or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky, but big, bonus, but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.
People here played it safe.
Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too.
Qualitatively and quantitatively, they choose exactly the same way as people, when tested in the same thing.
You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk.
Maybe we should see how they do with losses.
And so we ran a second version of this.
Now, the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses; they're actually giving them less than they expect.
So they look like they're starting out with a big amount.
These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.
But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.
They guy on the left is a safe loss.
Every single time, he's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two.
the guy on the right is the risky loss.
Sometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched, but sometimes he actually gives a big loss, taking away two to give the monkeys only one.
And so what do the monkeys do?
Again, same choice; they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time, or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.
The remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice, they do the same irrational thing that people do.
They actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started.
This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.
So what does all of this mean?
Well, what we've shown is that, first of all, we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency, and they do very similar things with it.
They do some of the smart things we do, some of the kind of not so nice things we do, like steal it and so on.
But they also do some of the irrational things we do.
They systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do.
This is the first take-home message of the Talk, which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought, oh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.
They're way cuter than the one at ... you know -- Don't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have.
So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
A little bad for monkey investors.
But of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too.
Because we've answered the question we started out with.
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.
And we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions, tweak our technologies to make ourselves better.
But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.
In fact, they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history.
You know, maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey.
Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.
And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results, means that these duncey strategies might be 35 million years old.
That's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around -- really, really old.
What do we know about other old strategies like this?
Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.
You know, think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.
You can't just shut that off.
You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me."
We're just built differently.
We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.
My guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions.
When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red, when you're watching your house price go down, you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms.
This means that the biases that lead investors to do badly, that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome.
So that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?
I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.
Well, the good news, I think, is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk, which is that humans are not only smart; we're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.
We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations -- you know, I flew over here in an airplane.
I didn't have to try to flap my wings.
I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.
I don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.
We actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations.
And here's the rub.
It was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is."
But the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them.
The hope is that you all will think about your limitations, not necessarily as unovercomable, but to recognize them, accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out.
That might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species we hope to all be.
Thank you.

<title>Laurie Santos: A monkey economy as irrational as ours</title>
<description>Laurie Santos looks for the roots of human irrationality by watching the way our primate relatives make decisions. A clever series of experiments in "monkeynomics" shows that some of the silly choices we make, monkeys make too.</description>
<keywords>brain,business,design,economics,money,psychology,science</keywords>

We conventionally divide space into private and public realms, and we know these legal distinctions very well because we've become experts at protecting our private property and private space.
But we're less attuned to the nuances of the public.
What translates generic public space into qualitative space?
I mean, this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade.
And we're doing this through some case studies.
A large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post-industrial space that looks forward and backward at the same time.
And another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that's grown out of sync with its time.
We've been working on democratizing Lincoln Center for a public that doesn't usually have $300 to spend on an opera ticket.
So we've been eating, drinking, thinking, living public space for quite a long time.
And it's taught us really one thing, and that is to truly make good public space, you have to erase the distinctions between architecture, urbanism, landscape, media design and so on.
It really goes beyond distinction.
Now we're moving onto Washington, D.C.
and we're working on another transformation, and that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum that's sited on the most revered public space in America, the National Mall.
The Mall is a symbol of American democracy.
And what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing, it's not an image, it's not an artifact, actually it's a space, and it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side.
It's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power.
It's a place where pivotal moments in American history have taken place.
And they're inscribed in there forever -- like the march on Washington for jobs and freedom and the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there.
The Vietnam protests, the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of AIDS, the march for women's reproductive rights, right up until almost the present.
The Mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for dissent.
And it's synonymous with free speech, even if you're not sure what it is that you have to say.
It may just be a place for civic commiseration.
There is a huge disconnect, we believe, between the communicative and discursive space of the Mall and the museums that line it to either side.
And that is that those museums are usually passive, they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience, as the receiver of information.
And so you can see dinosaurs and insects and collections of locomotives and all of that, but you're really not involved; you're being talked to.
When Richard Koshalek took over as director of the Hirshhorn in 2009, he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited at the most unique place: at the seat of power in the U.S.
And while art and politics are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time, there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness.
The question is, is it possible ultimately for art to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs?
And could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy?
There are over 180 embassies in Washington D.C.
There are over 500 think tanks.
There should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy into, and somehow through, the museum.
There should be some kind of brain trust.
So the Hirshhorn, as we began to think about it, and as we evolved the mission, with Richard and his team -- it's really his life blood.
But beyond exhibiting contemporary art, the Hirshhorn will become a public forum, a place of discourse for issues around arts, culture, politics and policy.
It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum.
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference.
It would have the informality of the town square.
And for this new initiative, the Hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate a site for a contemporary, deployable structure.
This is it. This is the Hirshhorn -- so a 230-foot-diameter concrete doughnut designed in the early '70s by Gordon Bunshaft.
It's hulking, it's silent, it's cloistered, it's arrogant, it's a design challenge.
Architects love to hate it.
One redeeming feature is it's lifted up off the ground and it's got this void, and it's got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style.
And around that space, the ring is actually galleries.
Very, very difficult to mount shows in there.
When the Hirshhorn opened, Ada Louise Huxstable, the New York Times critic, had some choice words: "Neo-penitentiary modern."
"A maimed monument and a maimed Mall for a maimed collection."
Almost four decades later, how will this building expand for a new progressive program?
Where would it go?
It can't go in the Mall.
There is no space there.
It can't go in the courtyard.
It's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures.
Well there's always the hole.
But how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it invisibly?
How could it become iconic?
And what language would it take?
The Hirshhorn sits among the Mall's momumental institutions.
Most are neoclassical, heavy and opaque, made of stone or concrete.
And the question is, if one inhabits that space, what is the material of the Mall?
It has to be different from the buildings there.
It has to be something entirely different.
It has to be air.
In our imagination, it has to be light.
It has to be ephemeral. It has to be formless.
And it has to be free.
So this is the big idea.
It's a giant airbag.
The expansion takes the shape of its container and it oozes out wherever it can -- the top and sides.
But more poetically, we like to think of the structure as inhaling the democratic air of the Mall, bringing it into itself.
The before and the after.
It was dubbed "the bubble" by the press.
That was the lounge.
It's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction.
The membrane is translucent.
It's made of silcon-coated glass fiber.
And it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time.
This is the view from the inside.
So you might have been wondering how in the world did we get this approved by the federal government.
It had to be approved by actually two agencies.
And one is there to preserve the dignity and sanctity of the Mall.
I blush whenever I show this.
It is yours to interpret.
But one thing I can say is that it's a combination of iconoclasm and adoration.
There was also some creative interpretation involved.
The Congressional Buildings Act of 1910 limits the height of buildings in D.C.
to 130 feet, except for spires, towers, domes and minarettes.
This pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state.
And the bubble is 153 ft.
That's the Pantheon next to it.
It's about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air.
And so we argued it on the merits of being a dome.
So there it is, very stately, among all the stately buildings in the Mall.
And while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked, it's very, very historically sensitive.
And so we couldn't really touch its surfaces.
We couldn't leave any traces behind.
So we strained it from the edges, and we held it by cables.
It's a study of some bondage techniques, which are actually very, very important because it's hit by wind all the time.
There's one permanent steel ring at the top, but it can't be seen from any vantage point on the Mall.
There are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit.
It glows from within, it's translucent.
But it can't be more lit than the Capitol or some of the monuments.
So it's down the hierarchy on lighting.
So it comes to the site twice a year.
It's taken off the delivery truck.
It's hoisted.
And then it's inflated with this low-pressure air.
And then it's restrained with the cables.
And then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom.
This is a very strange moment where we were asked by the bureaucracy at the Mall how much time would it take to install.
And we said, well the first erection would take one week.
And they really connected with that idea.
And then it was really easy all the way through.
So we didn't really have that many hurdles, I have to say, with the government and all the authorities.
But some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones.
This is the warp and weft.
This is a point cloud.
There are extreme pressures.
This is a very, very unusual building in that there's no gravity load, but there's load in every direction.
And I'm just going to zip through these slides.
And this is the space in action.
So flexible interior for discussions, just like this, but in the round -- luminous and reconfigurable.
Could be used for anything, for performances, films, for installations.
And the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations.
Form and content are together here.
The bubble is an anti-monument.
The ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity.
Art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls, but inside of the museum's core, blending its air with the democratic air of the Mall.
And the bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of 2013.
Thank you.

<keywords>architecture,cities,creativity</keywords>

On September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday, I came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something, and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said, "Hey, happy birthday!" And I said, "I'm seven."
And my father smiled and said, "Well, you know what that means, don't you?"
And I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents?" And my dad said, "Well, yes.
But, more importantly, being seven means that you've reached the age of reason, and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man."
Now, I had heard this phrase, "age of reason," before.
Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second-grade class at school. But when she said it, the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession, and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil, and anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase, "age of reason."
So, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?"
And my dad said, "Well, we believe in the Catholic Church that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong, but when you're seven, you're old enough to know better.
So, you've grown up, and reached the age of reason, and now God will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record."
And I said, "Oh. Wait a minute. You mean all that time, up till today, all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it?"
And my mom said, "Well, I noticed it."
And I thought, "How could I not have known this before?
How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me?
All that being good and no real credit for it.
And, worst of all, how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me?"
So I said, "Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus?
I mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?"
And my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey, I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas."
And my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her.
I mean, she's seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus."
Now, this was actually not that upsetting to me.
My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus: how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve, like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning, our family would give Santa more time.
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss.
Which made me very suspicious.
It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents.
I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style, and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.
Plus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's?
There's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence: our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit, and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment, this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly -- but, let's face it, he was also very judgmental.
So, to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief.
I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa, but rather I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing.
It was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else, someone who could use the information.
They had to fit two criteria: they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven.
The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six.
Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. It was a Saturday, and he was all by himself, just kicking a ball against the side of a wall.
I ran up to him and said, "Bill!
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven, and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man." And Bill said, "So?" And then I said, "So, you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it." And he said, "So?" And I said, "So? So everything!" And I turned to run. I was so angry with him.
But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically and said, "Oh, by the way, Bill, there is no Santa Claus."
Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10.
For my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends, but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said, "I need to speak to you privately.
September 10 is not your birthday. It's October 10." And I said, "What?"
And she said, "Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15."
"So, I told them that your birthday was on September 10, and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place, so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10.
But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready."
I thought about it, and when I was four, I was already the oldest of four children, and my mother even had another child to come, so what I think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready, she was so ready. Then she said, "Don't worry, Julie, every year on October 10 when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it, I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day."
Which was comforting, but troubling.
My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.
What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I was going to have to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends, what was most upsetting was that this meant that I was not a Virgo.
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom, and I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me.
And this meant that I was a Libra?
So, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster.
The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair, sort of lounging by some water, but the Libra poster is just a huge scale.
This was around the time that I started filling out physically, and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls, and, frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing.
But I got the new Libra poster, and I started to read my new Libra horoscope, and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.
It wasn't until years later, looking back on this whole age-of-reason/change-of-birthday thing, that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me.
Oh, life can be so cruel.
One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.
Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles, and my block is -- well, it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door.
Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven.
And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them.
So, normally I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day I answered.
And there stood two boys, each about 19, in white starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they said they had a message for me from God.
I said, "A message for me? From God?" And they said, "Yes."
Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was, sort of, curious, so I said, "Well, please, come in." And they looked really happy, because I don't think this happens to them all that often.
And I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water -- OK, I got it. I got them glasses of water.
Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.
You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair.
OK. So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water, and after niceties they said, "Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?"
And I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God, but, you know, I don't like that word, heart, because it anthropomorphizes God, and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God."
But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys, so after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said "Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved."
And they looked at each other and smiled, like that was the right answer. And then they said, "Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?"
And I said, "Yes, I do. Yes, I do." And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly.
And they said, "Well, then we have a story to tell you."
And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi, who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.
Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus.
And God came to Lehi and said to him, "Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here." And God did lead them.
He led them to America.
I said, "America? From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?"
And they said, "Yes."
Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites, and the Nephites were totally, totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil -- every single one of them just bad to the bone.
Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins, on his way up to heaven he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.
And he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good -- each and every one of them -- they would win the war against the evil Lamanites.
But apparently somebody blew it, because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites.
All but one guy, this guy named Mormon, who managed to survive by hiding in the woods.
And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates, which he then buried near Palmyra, New York.
I said, "What happened to the Lamanites?"
And they said, "Well, they became our Native Americans here in the U.S."
And I said, "So, you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil?" And they said, "Yes."
Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard, and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English.
Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch.
I wanted to say, "OK, don't start with this story."
I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start -- -- telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord.
Well, then they said, "Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets?" And I said, "No, I don't."
Because I was, sort of, upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, "Well, what exactly do you mean by righteous?
And what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?"
And they said, "No." And I said, "Why?" And they said, "Well, it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular, it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy."
What is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered?
Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?
Women's longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men? But, no, it wasn't any of these gifts.
They said, "Well, it's her ability to bear children."
I said, "Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45, assuming they didn't die from exhaustion, it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God." And they said, "No."
Well, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more, but they had more to say.
They said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon and if you're in good standing with the church, when you die you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity."
And I said, "Oh, dear -- -- that wouldn't be such a good incentive for me."
And they said, "Oh -- hey, well, we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state.
Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back.
Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see."
I said, "Oh -- now, I don't have a uterus because I had cancer a few years ago. So, does this mean that if I went to heaven I would get my old uterus back?" And they said, "Sure."
And I said, "I don't want it back. I'm happy without it." Gosh.
What if you had a nose job and you liked it?
Would God force you to get your old nose back?
Well, then they gave me this Book of Mormon, and they told me to read this chapter and that chapter, and they said they'd come back some day and check in on me, and I think I said something like, "Please don't hurry," or maybe it was just, "Please don't," and they were gone.
OK, so, I initially felt really superior to these boys, and smug in my more conventional faith. But then, the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself.
If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time, and they said, "We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse, and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us -- -- and she had a baby, and that's the son of God," I mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous.
I'm just so used to that story.
So, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys.
But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head: Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart?
Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question.
Now, if they'd asked me, Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?
Well, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered, "Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused, and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits, and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see."
But since they asked me that question with the word believe in it, somehow it was all different, because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.

[Sanskrit] This is an ode to the mother goddess, that most of us in India learn when we are children.
I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee.
That year she introduced me to dance, and thus began my tryst with classical dance.
Since then -- it's been four decades now -- I've trained with the best in the field, performed across the globe, taught young and old alike, created, collaborated, choreographed, and wove a rich tapestry of artistry, achievement and awards.
The crowning glory was in 2007, when I received this country's fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, for my contribution to art.
But nothing, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008.
I heard the word "carcinoma."
Yes, breast cancer.
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office, I heard other words: "cancer," "stage," "grade."
Until then, Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend, stage was what I performed on, and grades were what I got in school.
That day, I realized I had an unwelcome, uninvited, new life partner.
As a dancer, I know the nine rasas or the navarasas: anger, valor, disgust, humor and fear.
I thought I knew what fear was.
That day, I learned what fear was.
Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control, I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband, Jayant.
I said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?
Is this the end of my dance?"
And he, the positive soul that he is, said, "No, this is just a hiatus, a hiatus during the treatment, and you'll get back to doing what you do best."
I realized then that I, who thought I had complete control of my life, had control of only three things: My thought, my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it.
So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you, with the enormity of the situation, wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.
I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, for which I needed something.
I needed something that would pull me out of all this.
So I dried my tears, and I declared to the world at large ...
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life, and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."
I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out, and I would not allow cancer to ride me.
But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, I needed something.
I needed an anchor, an image, a peg to peg this process on, so that I could go from there.
And I found that in my dance, my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion, my very life breath.
But it wasn't easy.
Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.
How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days?
How do you not despair when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy, climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture, that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?
How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all?
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.
But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have.
So I would drag myself into my dance studio -- body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio, and learn everything I learned when I was four, all over again, reworked, relearned, regrouped.
It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.
Difficult.
I focused on my mudras, on the imagery of my dance, on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself.
And slowly, I moved out of that miserable state of mind.
But I needed something else.
I needed something to go that extra mile, and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four.
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini, of Durga.
Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one, created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.
Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful, her 18 arms ready for warfare, as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.
Durga, the epitome of creative feminine energy, or shakti.
Durga, the fearless one.
I made that image of Durga and her every attribute, her every nuance, my very own.
Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training, I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance, laser-sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery.
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles, much to the dismay of my oncologist.
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule.
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance.
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.
My story is a story of overcoming setbacks, obstacles and challenges that life throws at you.
My story is the power of thought.
My story is the power of choice.
It's the power of focus.
It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you, so moves you, that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.
My story is the power of a metaphor.
It's the power of an image.
Mine was that of Durga, Durga the fearless one.
She was also called Simhanandini, the one who rode the lion.
As I ride out, as I ride my own inner strength, my own inner resilience, armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment, as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer, asking my rogue cells to behave, I want to be known not as a cancer survivor, but as a cancer conqueror.
I present to you an excerpt of that work "Simhanandini."

How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations, about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago, bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today?
This is not a finished story.
It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece: a man burning his life's work.
He is a poet, a playwright, a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom.
Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon, confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste.
Words, for so long his friends, now mocked him.
He retreated into silence.
He died broken by history.
He is my grandfather.
I never knew him in real life.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never let me forget his life.
My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain, and my lesson was to learn that, yes, history tried to crush us, but we endured.
The next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea.
My mother, Mai, was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage, already with two small girls.
For her, life had distilled itself into one task: the escape of her family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed.
So after a four-year saga that defies fiction, a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was of pirates, rape and death.
Like most adults on the boat, my mother carried a small bottle of poison.
If we were captured, first my sister and I, then she and my grandmother would drink.
My first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine, the bow dipping into each wave, the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates who came many times, but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat, or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died, the journey's end too much for him, and the first apple I tasted, given to me by the men on the rig.
No apple has ever tasted the same.
After three months in a refugee camp, we landed in Melbourne.
And the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together.
We settled in Footscray, a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants.
Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs, whose existence I was oblivious of, there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray.
The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world.
And the snippets of halting English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common, they were starting again.
My mother worked on farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double shifts.
Somehow she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications.
We were poor.
All the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out, which was usually new clothes; they were always secondhand.
Two pairs of stockings for school, each to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform down to the ankles, because it had to last for six years.
And there were rare but searing chants of "slit-eye" and the occasional graffiti: "Asian, go home."
Go home to where?
Something stiffened inside me.
There was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying, "I will bypass you."
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted each night, but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house.
My mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat.
And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so I could wake her.
She opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition, angry and inflexible, and troubled children caught between two worlds.
Grants and sponsors were sought.
Centers were established.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic Asian student, relentless in the demands that I made on myself.
In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious, tragically scarred by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But so many over the years were helped.
And for that work, when I was a final year law student, I was chosen as the young Australian of the year.
And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another, and their edges didn't fit.
Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident, was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist, invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use the cutlery.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years, telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep, the three of us still in the same bed.
I told my mother I couldn't do it.
She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat.
No had never been an option.
"Just do it," she said, "and don't be what you're not."
So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised.
And the more candidly I spoke, the more I was asked to speak.
I met people from all walks of life, so many of them doing the thing they loved, living on the frontiers of possibility.
And even though I finished my degree, I realized I could not settle into a career in law.
There had to be another piece of the jigsaw.
And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider, a recent arrival, new on the scene -- and not just okay, but something to be thankful for, perhaps a gift from the boat.
Because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons, can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province.
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that, yes, the world does fall apart, but not in the way that you fear.
Possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged.
There was an energy there, an implacable optimism, a strange mixture of humility and daring.
So I followed my hunches.
I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label "It can't be done" was an irresistible challenge.
For a year we were penniless.
At the end of each day, I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared.
We worked well into each night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but a few were brilliant, and we broke through.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after only one trip.
My hunches again.
Three months later I had relocated, and the adventure has continued.
Before I close though, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died soon after she was born.
Her mother raised her alone.
At 17 she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother beat her.
With no support from her husband, she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case, and a far greater sensation when she won.
"It can't be done" was shown to be wrong.
I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in Melbourne.
I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side.
I knew she had come to say goodbye.
My mother phoned minutes later.
A few days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket.
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her.
At midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket.
My mother asked us to feel her hand.
She asked the monk, "Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold?"
"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said.
"You have not let it go."
If there is a sinew in our family, it runs through the women.
Given who we were and how life had shaped us, we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have thwarted us.
Defeat would have come too easily.
Now I would like to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could ever wish it on their own?
Yet I am afraid of privilege, of ease, of entitlement.
Can I give them a bow in their lives, dipping bravely into each wave, the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine, the vast horizon that guarantees nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and still see them safely through, I would.
And also, Tan's mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row.

<title>Tan Le: My immigration story</title>
<description>In 2010, technologist Tan Le took the TEDGlobal stage to demo a powerful new interface. But now, at TEDxWomen, she tells a very personal story: the story of her family -- mother, grandmother and sister -- fleeing Vietnam and building a new life. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>
<keywords>storytelling</keywords>

The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years.
But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.
So, here you can see the change from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.
These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.
In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form, which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point, and started developing, really, and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide, so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us, and not only to supply the materials on bobbins, but to produce to our color specifications.
At the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products, away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market.
We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms. The scale became very important, and it's become our pet project. It's successful, it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops, and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.
This is our group, our main group of weavers.
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.
They all have bank accounts.
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.
It's a weekly turnaround of production.
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.
And that's also modernized today, and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.
And the rest says it all.
Thank you very much.

Now, since this is TEDGlobal, who can tell me what this is called in French?
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- "vielle à roue."
And in Spanish, "zanfona."
And in Italian, "ghironda," okay?
Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.
So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.
The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings, like the bow of a violin, to produce music.
It has three different kinds of strings.
The first string is the drone string, which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.
The second string is a melody string, which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.
And the third string is pretty innovative.
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique.
It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.
When I turn the crank and I apply pressure, it makes a sound like a barking dog.
So all of this is pretty innovative, if you consider that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it; one to turn the crank, and another person -- yes -- to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.
Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.
So, one person could actually play and almost -- this is pretty heavy -- carry the hurdy-gurdy.
The hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here.
And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music, dance, contemporary and world music -- in the U.K., in France, in Spain and in Italy.
And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].
It's made by specialized luthiers, also in Europe.
And it's very difficult to tune.
So without further ado, would you like to hear it?
Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it?
CP: Okay.
There I go.
I'd like to sing in Basque, which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live, in the region in France and Spain.
[Basque] Thank you.
This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms.
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel.

I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century, and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.
But I want to start with my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work.
What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner.
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped.
And so I want to tell you about that first, and then go on into where I think love is going.
"What 'tis to love?" Shakespeare said.
I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago.
I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years of research on -- just the psychological research -- and as it turns out, there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love.
The first thing that happens is what I call -- a person begins to take on what I call, "special meaning."
As a truck driver once said to me, he said, "The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne."
George Bernard Shaw said it a little differently.
He said, "Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another."
And indeed, that's what we do.
And then you just focus on this person.
You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.
As Chaucer said, "Love is blind."
In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry from all over the world, and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China, because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman.
It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot -- their car is different from every other car in the parking lot.
Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party.
And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.
And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Chen: "I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat.
The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out."
He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me.
But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them.
You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy.
As one Polynesian said, he said, "I felt like jumping in the sky."
You're up all night. You're walking till dawn.
You feel intense elation when things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly.
Real dependence on this person.
As one businessman in New York said to me, he said, "Anything she liked, I liked."
Simple. Romantic love is very simple.
You become extremely sexually possessive.
You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually, you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else.
But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely sexually possessive of them.
I think that that is a Darwinian -- there's a Darwinian purpose to this.
The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team.
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving: an intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally.
You'd much rather -- it would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you.
The other main characteristic is motivation.
The motor in your brain begins to crank, and you want this person.
And last but not least, it is an obsession.
When I put these people in the machine, before I put them in the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions.
But my most important question was always the same.
It was: "What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?"
And indeed, they would say, "All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him or her."
And then, the very last question I would ask them -- I would always have to work myself up to this question, because I am not a psychologist.
I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation.
And my final question was always the same.
I would say, "Would you die for him or her?"
And, indeed, these people would say "Yes!"
as if I had asked them to pass the salt.
I was just staggered by it.
So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between.
So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state.
And we found activity in a lot of brain regions.
In fact, one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine.
And indeed, that's exactly what happens.
I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion.
In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low.
But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.
The kind of mind -- part of the mind -- when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work.
The motor of the brain. It's a drive.
And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive.
You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, "No, thank you," you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression.
But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it.
People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love.
They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.
In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system.
I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy and great sorrow.
And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction.
One is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification.
W.H. Auden called it an "intolerable neural itch," and indeed, that's what it is.
It keeps bothering you a little bit, like being hungry.
The second of these three brain systems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love.
And the third brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.
And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners.
You know, you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car.
It can be focused on nobody.
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy.
And I think that attachment, the third brain system, evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being -- -- at least long enough to raise a child together as a team.
So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends.
One of the last 10,000 years and the other, certainly of the last 25 years, that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems: lust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner.
The first is women working, moving into the workforce.
I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations.
And everywhere in the world, 129 out of 130 of them, women are not only moving into the job market -- sometimes very, very slowly, but they are moving into the job market -- and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power, health and education.
It's very slow.
For every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend.
We all know of them, but nevertheless -- the Arabs say, "The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on."
And, indeed, that caravan is moving on.
Women are moving back into the job market.
And I say back into the job market, because this is not new.
For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work to gather their vegetables.
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.
The double income family was the standard.
And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men.
In short, we're really moving forward to the past.
Then, women's worst invention was the plow.
With the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful.
Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors, but then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market.
In short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.
We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal.
And it's going to have an impact.
I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community.
I'll only just say a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love.
There's a lot of gender differences; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child.
I don't know why it is that they want to think that men and women are alike.
There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common.
We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes, "I think that we were built to be -- we're like two feet. We need each other to get ahead."
But we did not evolve to have the same brain.
And we're finding more and more and more gender differences in the brain.
I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.
One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk.
Women's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak.
But even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.
Women can talk.
They've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.
They held that baby in front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.
And, indeed, they're becoming a very powerful force.
Even in places like India and Japan, where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market, they're moving into journalism.
And I think that the television is like the global campfire.
We sit around it and it shapes our minds.
Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producers who call me, who negotiate what we're going to say, is a woman.
In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, "To have a great writer is to have another government."
Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women.
It's one of many, many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market.
They've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills.
They're highly imaginative.
We now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning.
They tend to be web thinkers.
Because the female parts of the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes.
They tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers.
Men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous, focus on what they do, and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern.
They're both perfectly good ways of thinking.
We need both of them to get ahead.
In fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world.
When the -- and there's also many more male idiots in the world.
When the male brain works well, it works extremely well.
And what I really think that we're doing is, we're moving towards a collaborative society, a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed.
But in fact, women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life.
Foremost, women are starting to express their sexuality.
I'm always astonished when people come to me and say, "Why is it that men are so adulterous?"
And I say, "Why do you think more men are adulterous than women?"
"Oh, well -- men are more adulterous!"
And I say, "Who do you think these men are sleeping with?"
And -- basic math!
Anyway.
In the Western world, women start sooner at sex, have more partners, express less remorse for the partners that they do, marry later, have fewer children, leave bad marriages in order to get good ones.
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression.
And, indeed, once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago, because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today.
We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality.
They're now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the "symmetrical marriage," or the "pure marriage," or the "companionate marriage."
This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.
We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.
91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner, if they were not in love with that person.
People around the world, in a study of 37 societies, want to be in love with the person that they marry.
Indeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life.
I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend.
The first one being women moving into the job market, the second one being the aging world population.
They're now saying that in America, that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85.
Because in that highest age category of 76 to 85, as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them.
So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age.
And I looked -- for one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.
And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.
So the divorce rate right now is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline.
It may decline some more.
I would even say that with Viagra, estrogen replacement, hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women -- women have never been as interesting as they are now.
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable.
And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now.
However, there's always kinds of complications in this.
In these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment -- don't always go together.
They can go together, by the way.
That's why casual sex isn't so casual.
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.
Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with.
With orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin -- those are associated with attachment.
This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them.
But these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment, aren't always connected to each other.
You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else, while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners.
In short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time.
In fact, you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else.
It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do.
So I don't think, honestly, we're an animal that was built to be happy; we are an animal that was built to reproduce.
I think the happiness we find, we make.
And I think, however, we can make good relationships with each other.
So I want to conclude with two things.
I want to conclude with a worry -- I have a worry -- and with a wonderful story.
The worry is about antidepressants.
Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States.
And these drugs are going generic.
They are seeping around the world.
I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants, serotonin-enhancing -- SSRI, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13.
She's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13.
I've got nothing against people who take them short term, when they're going through something perfectly horrible.
They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else.
I would recommend it.
But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term.
And indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin.
And by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit.
Everybody knows that.
Dopamine is associated with romantic love.
Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive.
And when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm.
And when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment.
The things are connected in the brain.
And when you tamper with one brain system, you're going to tamper with another.
I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place.
So now -- -- thank you.
I want to end with a story. And then, just a comment.
I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years.
I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike.
Why you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike.
And about a year ago, an Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them.
I said, "I don't know anything about personality. You know?
I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person?"
They said, "Yes."
It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another.
That's my current project; it will be my next book.
There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another.
Timing is important. Proximity is important.
Mystery is important. You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious, in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain, probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love.
You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your "love map," an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up.
And I also think that you gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.
And that's what I'm now contributing to this.
But I want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate.
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love.
I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too -- the magic of it.
It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one of the -- probably a true story.
It was a graduate student at -- I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues -- Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.
That's where we put our people in the MRI machine.
And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student, and she was not in love with him.
And they were all at a conference in Beijing.
And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody, you can drive up the dopamine in the brain, and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love.
So he decided he'd put science to work, and he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him.
And sure enough -- I've never been in one, but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting.
And he figured that this would drive up the dopamine, and she would fall in love with him.
So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time.
An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw, and she throws her hands up and she says, "Wasn't that wonderful?"
And, "Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome!"
There's magic to love!
But I will end by saying that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives: the sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner.
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain.
They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called "this mortal coil."
Thank you.

Contagious is a good word.
Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word.
Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.
Inspiration is contagious.
We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.
But for me, what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the "I Can" bug.
So, the question is, why only them?
In a country of a billion people and some, why so few?
Is it luck? Is it chance?
Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected?
So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.
I got infected when I was 17, when, as a student of the design college, I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas, challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt, and how contagious that feeling was.
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab, a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.
And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real-world context, that if you blur the boundaries between school and life, then children go through a journey of "aware," where they can see the change, "enable," be changed, and then "empower," lead the change.
And that directly increased student wellbeing.
Children became more competent, and less helpless.
But this was all common sense.
So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside.
A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights, they were made to roll incense sticks, agarbattis, for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer.
It transformed them. What you will see is their journey, and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world.
That's them rolling.
And in two hours, after their backs were broke, they were changed.
And once that happened, they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished.
And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has shifted that man's mindset.
And that can't happen in a classroom.
So, when Ragav experienced that he went from "teacher told me," to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.
But we had parents who said, "Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well, but what about math and science and English?
Show us the grades."
And we did. The data was conclusive.
When children are empowered, not only do they do good, they do well, in fact very well, as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over 2,000 schools in India, Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India in math, English and science.
So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.
So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007, the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.
Now it was not about Riverside school.
It was about all children. So, we were shameless.
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police, the press, businesses, and basically said, "When are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child?
When will you include the child in the city?
Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child."
So, how did the city respond?
Since 2007 every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood.
Here was a city telling its child, "You can."
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.
[Unclear] So, the busiest streets closed down.
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.
It gets taken over by children.
They are skating. They are doing street plays.
They are playing, all free, for all children.
Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.
And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.
Kiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.
Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children, in the future the children will give back to the city.
K And because of that, Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.
So, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.
It was time now to infect India.
So, on August 15th, again, Independence Day, 2009, empowered with the same process, we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."
How? We designed a simple toolkit, converted it into eight languages, and reached 32,000 schools.
We basically gave children a very simple challenge.
We said, take one idea, anything that bothers you, choose one week, and change a billion lives.
And they did. Stories of change poured in from all over India, from Nagaland in the east, to Jhunjhunu in the west, from Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism, and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan.
I mean, it was incredible.
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say, "You can," then they will.
Infection in India.
This is in Rajasthan, a rural village.
Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write.
K First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school -- unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important.
Look at what their parents says.
This program is wonderful.
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.
I am so happy that my students did this campaign.
In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.
See? They have done it.
K An inner city school in Hyderabad.
Girl: 581. This house is 581 ...
We have to start collecting from 555.
K Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out, pretty difficult, but they did it.
Even though they are so young, they have done such good work.
First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.
It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me that they had so much inside them.
Girl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you, for a very good cause, the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.
Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes!
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
K So, the charter of compassion starts right here.
Street plays, auctions, petitions.
I mean, they were changing lives.
It was incredible.
So, how can we still stay immune?
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?
I know it's obvious, but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.
70 years ago, it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of "We can."
So, today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India?
Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?
So, if not us, then who?
If not now, then when?
Like I said, contagious is a good word.
Thank you.

Clearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.
Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us, and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.
Because of the resources, the skills, and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world, with the mindset to create change.
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.
And by definition, every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul, a global citizen.
You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another.
And no matter what country you live or work in, you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of, even in their most ordinariness.
Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies.
On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.
And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid.
And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.
We call it patient capital.
The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?
They use Mobutu as metaphor.
And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest, don't give anything away.
On the other side, as I said, there are those who say the problem is that we need more money.
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid, but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it.
They point to the successes of aid: the eradication of smallpox, and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.
Both sides are right.
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.
Even more problematic, they're not listening to poor people themselves.
After 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation, it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people.
They must navigate markets daily, making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens, to move their way through society, and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family, they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.
And so we need both the market and we need aid.
Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both.
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives.
Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have, and the expectation of below-market returns, but outsized social impact.
It recognizes that the market has its limitation, and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people.
Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons.
First, they tend to work in markets where people make one, two, three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.
Second, the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure -- no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption.
Third, they are often creating markets.
Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.
And so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time, takes a lot of patience.
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.
Not only to build the systems, the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way, but to connect those business to other markets, to governments, to corporations -- real partnerships if we want to get to scale.
I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation.
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India, who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.
And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether, despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day.
They were creating subsidies either for large farms, or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use, rather than that the farmers wanted to use.
At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel.
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant.
And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers, because these systems were both too expensive, and they were constructed for fields that were too large.
The average small village farmer works on two acres or less.
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves, because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have.
And he used three fundamental principles.
The first one was miniaturization.
The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest, or else they wouldn't take the risk.
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable.
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth.
As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization, has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average, but this didn't happen overnight.
In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day, that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.
And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants to research, to experiment, to fail, to innovate and try again.
And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers, that's when patient capital could come in.
And we helped him build a company, for profit, that would build on IDE's knowledge, and start looking at sales and exports, and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.
Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
And while, again, you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan, just to get the permits, over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono, who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert, which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.
And though that company has just started, our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions.
But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.
We're starting to see these happening all around the world.
In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us, with UNICEF, with the Global Fund, to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.
And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world.
Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality, affordable maternal health care to low-income women, and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every 35 days.
And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry, building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth, a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access, and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption.
So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder, and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.
They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances, and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India.
This idea of scale is critical.
Because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people.
But that's obviously not enough.
And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important.
Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets, government itself, or partner with major corporations, there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.
President Obama understands that.
He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country, and look at how we can scale it.
And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations, not only for their country, but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.
Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.
And then measure the returns, both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective.
When we think about new approaches to aid, it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.
We've had a rocky relationship with that country and, in all fairness, the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.
But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen.
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund, we could use this time to invest not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing, nor in international experts, but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country.
People like Rashani Zafar, who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country, and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.
And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way called incremental housing, where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe, affordable community housing.
Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country.
It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban.
I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now, and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population, and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.
President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
I would say that the converse is true.
That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day, provide real pathways to hope.
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan, while we need to strengthen the judiciary, build greater stability, we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world.
On one of my last visits to Pakistan, I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.
And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.
It was about 115 degrees.
And we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color, lots of heat, very little discussion, because we were exhausted.
And finally, at the end of the journey, I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.
And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.
That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.
Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life.
His name was Raja, and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father.
And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day.
Because he was building these crops.
And with the money he earned he could stay this year.
And for the first time ever in three generations, his children would go to school.
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.
And he said, "Of course I will.
Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore."
When we think about solutions to poverty, we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity.
Because at the end of the day, dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity.
Because that is where dignity really starts.
Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental, and that power without love is reckless and abusive.
Our generation has seen both approaches tried, and often fail.
But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power.
For that is what we'll need, as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us, and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.
The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.
I can only talk from my own experience, but in eight years of running Acumen fund, I've seen the power of patient capital.
Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking, but to truly build systems that have created more than 25,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet.
I know it works.
But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.
And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work, in whatever job you do, to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help.
Rather than what we think that they might need.
It will take embracing the world with both arms.
And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability, with a sense of integrity and perseverance.
And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations.
And there is so much good that we can do.
Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.
Thank you.

<title>Jacqueline Novogratz: A third way to think about aid</title>
<description>The debate over foreign aid often pits those who mistrust "charity" against those who mistrust reliance on the markets. Jacqueline Novogratz proposes a middle way she calls patient capital, with promising examples of entrepreneurial innovation driving social change.</description>

Over the past couple of days as I've been preparing for my speech, I've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people.
Being on the same stage as Al Gore, who was the first person I ever voted for.
And -- So I was getting pretty nervous and, you know, I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage, and that's more nerve wracking.
But then I started thinking about my family.
I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather, and I realized that I had all of these Teds going through my blood stream -- -- that I had to consider this "my element."
So, who am I?
Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband.
We have about 125 people internationally.
If you looked in the book, you saw this, which I really was appalled by.
And because I wanted to impress you all with slides, since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs, I made a graph that moves, and I talk about the makeup of me.
So, besides this freakish thing, this is my science slide. This is math, and this is science; this is genetics.
This is my grandmother, and this is where I get this mouth.
I'm a blogger, which, probably to a lot of you, means different things.
You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha, where a blogger talked about how you hack, or break into, a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen, and it spread all over. Kryptonite had to adjust the lock, and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns.
You may have heard about Rathergate, which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the "th" in 111 is not typesetted on an old typewriter; it's on Word.
Bloggers exposed this, or they worked hard to expose this.
You know, blogs are scary. This is what you see.
I see this, and I'm sure scared -- and I swear on stage -- shitless about blogs, because this is not something that's friendly.
But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media, and, you know, these are great examples. These people are reaching thousands, if not millions, of readers, and that's incredibly important.
During the hurricane, you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog, updating it frequently. This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools.
You have my friend, who has a blog on digital -- on PDRs, personal recorders.
He makes enough money, just by running ads, to support his family up in Oregon.
That's all he does now, and this is something that blogs have made possible.
It's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it.
Children with cleft palates will get it, and they document their story. This is wonderful.
I am not that caring.
I talk about myself. That's what I am. I'm a blogger.
I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing, and I am an expert on this person, and so I write about it.
And -- the short story about my blog: it started in 2001. I was 23.
I wasn't happy with my job, because I was a designer, but I wasn't being really stimulated.
I was an English major in college. I didn't have any use for it, but I missed writing. So, I started to write a blog and I started to create things like these little stories.
This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was 11 years old, and how I went to a YMCA camp -- Christian camp -- and basically by the end, I had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk. They couldn't find me.
They sent a search party, and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself, jumped off Bible Peak.
You can laugh, this is OK.
This is me.
This is what happened to me.
And when I started my blog it was really this one goal -- I said, I am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet.
And I set a goal. I said, "I'm going to win an award," because I had never won an award in my entire life.
And I said, "I'm going to win this award -- the South by Southwest Weblog award."
And I won it. I reached all of these people, and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday.
And then I wrote a post about a banjo.
I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo -- a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money, and I don't play instruments; I don't know anything about music.
I like music, and I like banjos, and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing, and I said, "I could do that."
And I said to my husband, I said, "Ben, can I buy a banjo?" And he's like, "No."
And my husband -- this is my husband, who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me, "You cannot buy a banjo.
You're just like your dad," who "collects" instruments.
And I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him; he was such a tyrant because he would not let me buy this banjo.
And those people who know me understood my joke.
This is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people.
Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant: this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog.
And if he knew I was showing this right now -- I put this in today -- he would kill me.
But the thing was, I wrote this, and my friends read it, and they're like, "Oh, that Mena, she wrote a post about, you know, wanting a stupid thing and being stupid."
But I got emails from people that said, "Oh my God, your husband is such an asshole.
How much money does he spend on beer in a year?
You could take that money and buy your banjo.
Why don't you open a separate account?"
I've been with him since I was 17 years old. We've never had a separate bank account.
They said, "Separate your bank account -- spend your money; spend his money. That's it."
And then I got people saying, "Leave him."
And -- I was like, "OK, what, who are these people?
And why are they reading this?"
And I realized: I don't want to reach these people.
I don't want to write for this public audience.
And I started to kill my blog slowly.
I'm like, I don't want to write this anymore, and I slowly and slowly -- And I did tell personal stories from time to then.
I wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today.
And I'm going to get choked up, because this is my first pet, and she passed away two years ago.
And I decided to break from, "I don't really write about my public life," because I wanted to give her a little memorial.
But anyways.
It's these sort of personal stories. You know, you read the blogs about politics, or about media, and gossip and all these things.
These are out there, but it's more of the personal that interests me, and this is -- this is who I am.
You see Norman Rockwell. And you have art critics say, "Norman Rockwell is not art.
Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms, and this is not something to be considered high art."
And I think this is one of the most important things to us as humans.
These things resonate with us, and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs, the history paintings about, you know, all biblical stories, and then you have this.
These are the blogs that interest me: the people who just tell stories.
One story is about this baby, and his name is Odin.
His father was a blogger.
And he was writing his blog one day, and his wife gave birth to her baby at 25 weeks.
And he never expected this.
One day it was normal; the next day it was hell.
And this is a one-pound baby.
So Odin was documented every single day.
Pictures were taken every day: day one, day two ...
You have day nine -- they're talking about his apnea; day 39 -- he gets pneumonia.
His baby is so small, and I've never encountered such a just -- a disturbing image, but just -- just so heartfelt.
You're reading this as this happens, so on day 55, everybody reads that he's having failures: breathing failures and heart failures, and it's slowing down, and you don't know what to expect.
But then it gets better. Day 96 he goes home.
And you see this post.
That's not something that you're going to see in a paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels, and people are excited about it.
Twenty-eight comments. That's not a huge amount of people reading, but 28 people matter.
And today he is a healthy baby, who, if you read his blog -- it's Snowdeal.org, his father's blog -- he is taking pictures of him still, because he is still his son and he is, I think, at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital.
So, blogs.
So what? You've probably heard these things before.
We talked about the WELL, and we talked about all these sort of things throughout our online history.
But I think blogs are basically just an evolution, and that's where we are today.
It's this record of who you are, your persona.
You have your Google search where you say, "Hey, what is Mena Trott?"
And then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy.
But then you also find people's blogs, and those are the records of people who are writing daily -- not necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them.
And we talk about the world flattens as being this panel, and I am very optimistic.
Whenever I think about blogs I'm like, "Oh, we've got to reach all these people."
Millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people.
You know, we're getting into China, we want to be there, but you know, there are so many people who won't have the access to write a blog.
But to see something like the $100 computer is amazing, because it's a -- blogging software is simple.
We have a successful company because of timing, and because of perseverance, but it's simple stuff -- it's not rocket science.
And so, that's an amazing thing to consider.
So, the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important.
We started with a slide of my Teds, and I had to add this slide, because I knew that the minute I showed this, my mom -- my mom will see this deck somehow, because she does read my blog -- and she'll say, "Why wasn't there a picture of me?"
This is my mom. So, I have all of the people that I know of.
But this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my direct line.
I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before, and this one I grew up with, looking at constantly.
I would spend hours looking at just the connections, saying, "Oh, the little kid up at the top has red hair; so does that first generation up there."
And just these little things.
This is not science, but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line.
So, that has always influenced me.
I have this record, this 1910 census of another Grabowski -- that's my maiden name -- and there's a Theodore, because there's always a Theodore.
This is all I have. I have a couple of facts about somebody.
I have their date of birth, and their age, and what they did in their household, if they spoke English, and that's it. That's all I know of these people.
And it's pretty sad, because I only go back five generations, and then it's it. I don't even know what happens on my mom's side, because she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things.
And just doing this I spent time in the archives -- that's another thing why my husband's a saint -- I spent time in the Washington archives, just sitting there, looking for these things. Now it's online, but he sat through that.
And so you have this record and, you know, this is my great-great-grandmother.
This is the only picture I have. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs; to think about the people who are on those $100 computers talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing.
Another photo that has greatly influenced me, or a series of photos, is this project that's done by an Argentinean man and his wife.
And he's basically taking a picture of his family everyday for the past, what is '76 -- 20, oh my God, I'm '77 -- 29 years? Twenty-nine years.
There was a joke, originally, about my graph that I left out, which is: you see all this math? I'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100, because that's my skill set.
So you have these people aging, and now this is them today, or last year, and that's a powerful thing to have, to be able to track this.
I wish that I would have this of my family.
I know that one day my children will be wondering -- or my grandchildren, or my great-grandchildren, if I ever have children -- what I am going to -- who I was, so I do something that's very narcissistic: I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time everyday.
I take a picture of myself -- I've been doing this since last year -- every single day.
And, you know, it's the same picture; it's basically the same person.
Only a couple of people read it. I don't write this for this audience; I'm showing it now, but I would go insane if this was really public.
About four people probably read it, and they tell me, you know, "You haven't updated" -- I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated -- but this is something that's amazing, because I can go back to a day -- I can go back to April 2005, and say, what was I doing this day? I look at it, I know exactly.
It's this visual cue that is so important to what we do.
I put the bad pictures up too, because there are bad pictures.
And I remember instantly: I am in Germany in this -- I had to go for a one-day trip.
I was sick, and I was in a hotel room, and I wanted not to be there. And so you see these things.
It's not just always smiling. Now I've kind of evolved it, so I have this look.
If you look at my driver's license I have the same look, and it's -- it's -- a pretty disturbing thing but it's something that is really important.
And the last story I really want to tell is this story, because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I'm doing.
And I'll probably get choked up, because I tend to when I talk about this.
So, this woman, her name was Emma, and she was a blogger on our service, TypePad. And she was a beta tester, so she was there right when we opened -- you know, there were 100 people -- and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer.
She was writing and writing and writing, and we all started reading it, because we had so few blogs on the service, we could keep track of everyone.
And she was writing one day, and, you know, then she disappeared for a little bit.
And her sister came on, and she said that Emma had passed away. And all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional, and it was a very hard day at the company.
And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship, and flattening this sort of world.
That this woman is in England, and she lives -- she lived a life where she was talking about what she was doing.
But the big thing that really influenced us was, her sister wrote to me, and she said, you know, and she wrote on this blog, that -- writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her, and being able to talk to people, being able to share what was going on, and being able to write and receive comments.
And that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had empowered that, and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing, and that the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary, that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs, that we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people.
That was an amazing thing.
And -- and so I printed out her -- or I sent a PDF of her blog to her family, and they passed it out at her memorial service, and even in her obituary, they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life.
And that's a huge thing.
So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action to all of you is: you know, think about blogs, think about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something that is really going to change our lives.
So, thank you.

I've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty, form and function of giant bluefin tuna.
Bluefin are warmblooded like us.
They're the largest of the tunas, the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish.
They actually are a fish that is endothermic -- powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.
That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming.
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift, powers its movements with a lunate tail.
It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body, so it reduces friction with the water.
This is what one of nature's finest machines.
Now, bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history.
For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal, and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago.
Bluefin are in cave paintings in France.
They're on coins that date back 3,000 years.
This fish was revered by humankind.
It was fished sustainably till all of time, except for our generation.
Bluefin are pursued wherever they go -- there is a gold rush on Earth, and this is a gold rush for bluefin.
There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently.
And yet, the type of fishing going on today, with pens, with enormous stakes, is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet.
Now bluefin, in general, goes to one place: Japan.
Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin.
They're delectable muscle, rich in fat -- absolutely taste delicious.
And that's their problem; we're eating them to death.
Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple.
Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small.
The North American population is fished at about 2,000 ton.
The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna -- is fished at tremendous levels: 50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year.
The result is whether you're looking at the West or the Eastern bluefin population, there's been tremendous decline on both sides, as much as 90 percent if you go back with your baseline to 1950.
For that, bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers, to lions, to certain African elephants and to pandas.
These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months.
They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago, despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I.
And if it's tunas you don't care about, perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks, sharks, marlin, albatross.
These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries.
The challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna, and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an African lion takes down its prey.
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.
This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room.
It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way.
Technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely.
And we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works.
Most of us from the ship -- even I -- look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.
We don't know where the structure is.
We can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain.
We can't see the corridors, and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna, a leatherback and an albatross.
We're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot.
The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea.
It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf, the entire Pacific realm.
It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it.
And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU, getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays, an engineering challenge we've yet to really overcome.
So the story of our team, a dedicated team, is fish and chips.
We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts, or the same parts that are in your computer, chips.
We're putting them together in unusual ways, and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before.
And for the first time, we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset.
Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.
I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean, put it behind glass, and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.
When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning, we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean, one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim by.
We can see in their beauty of form and function, their ceaseless activity.
They're flying through their space, ocean space.
And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty.
Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
Here, for over 14 or 15 years, we've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity.
We'd been studying these fish, but first we had to learn how to husbandry them.
What do they like to eat?
What is it that they're happy with?
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin -- it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.
And then, better yet, we've got our own version of tuna whisperers, our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton, who can take a big tuna and in one motion, put it into an envelope of water, so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea.
Jeff and Jason there, are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.
And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.
We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption, its energy consumption.
We're taking this data and building better models.
And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view -- I begin to wonder: how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?
So take a look at that animal.
That's the closest you'll probably ever get.
Now, the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada, from Corsica to Spain.
We've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas.
We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.
And I'm going to show you three clips, because I tagged 1,100 tunas.
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.
We bring the tuna out, we measure it.
A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes.
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen.
And then with a lot of effort, after tagging, putting in the computer, making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment, we send this fish back into the sea.
And when it goes, we're always happy.
We see a flick of the tail.
And from our data that gets collected, when that tag comes back, because a fisher returns it for a thousand-dollar reward, we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now, on a backboned animal.
Now sometimes the tunas are really large, such as this fish off Nantucket.
But that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged.
It takes a human effort, a team effort, to bring the fish in.
In this case, what we're going to do is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.
This tag rides on the tuna, senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish, detach, float to the surface and send back to Earth-orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag, pressure data and temperature data.
And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag.
Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.
These tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America.
They are some of our finest instruments, our new technology in the ocean today.
One community in general has given more to help us than any other community.
And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.
There are two villages, Harris and Morehead City, every winter for over a decade, held a party called Tag-A-Giant, and together, fishers worked with us to tag 800 to 900 fish.
In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.
We're going to do something that in recent years we've started: take a mucus sample.
Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.
And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles, we can get information on gender, checking the pop-up tag one more time, and then it's out in the ocean.
And this is my favorite.
With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson, this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.
This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.
The warm is the Gulf Stream, the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.
That's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring -- but it can't get there. It's too cold.
But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish, maybe comes back to home base, goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas.
And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.
Three tunas tagged.
Astronomically, we're calculating positions.
They're coming together. That could be tuna sex -- and there it is.
That is where the tuna spawn.
So from data like this, we're able now to put the map up, and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging.
And now we're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side.
So two populations of tunas -- that is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag -- they go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that -- and a second population.
Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas -- are European tunas that go back to the Med.
On the hot spots -- the hope spots -- they're mixed populations.
And so what we've done with the science is we're showing the International Commission, building new models, showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model -- to this day, used to reject the CITES treaty -- that model isn't the right model.
This model, a model of overlap, is the way to move forward.
So we can then predict where management places should be.
Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species, the single population, can be captured.
These become forthright in places we need to protect.
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is, I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish, because they manage their fisheries well, they're doing a good job.
But in the international realm, where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild, these are the places that we have to make hope spots in.
That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.
Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics, we took on the planet as a team, those of us in the Census of Marine Life.
And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others, we were able to actually go in, in our project -- we're one of 17 field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators, not just tunas.
So what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska, met salmon shark on their home territory, followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line, we can actually take up a salmon shark -- This is the cousin of the white shark -- and very carefully -- note, I say "very carefully," -- we can actually keep it calm, put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag.
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message.
And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.
It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon, sending home its data.
Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag.
But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer.
Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey.
Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there -- and Sal Jorgensen.
They can throw out a target -- it's a carpet shaped like a seal -- and in will come a white shark, a curious critter that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.
It's a several thousand-pound animal.
And we'll wind in the target.
And we'll place an acoustic tag that says, "OMSHARK 10165," or something like that, acoustically with a ping.
And then we'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long-distance journeys with the light-based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that's on the fish.
So in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there, and there they are: the white sharks of California going off to the white shark cafe and coming back.
We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues, blue sharks.
And now, together, what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature, we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.
We have white sharks and blue sharks.
For the first time, an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale, showing where the sharks go.
The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable: three teams tagged 1,700 tunas, bluefin, yellowfin and albacore all at the same time -- carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas, put in the tags that actually have the sensors, stick out the tuna and then let them go.
They get returned, and when they get returned, here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor, returning to the Western Pacific.
Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.
These elephant seals cover half an ocean, take data down to 1,800 feet -- amazing data.
And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags, light-based tags, that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back, journeys of 35,000 nautical miles we had never seen before.
But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small, we can actually see these journeys.
Same thing with Laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes, up to the same zone the tunas use.
You can see why they might be caught.
Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are.
And Scott Benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey.
So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are.
We can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean.
And from this information, we can begin to map the hope spots.
So this is just three years of data right here -- and there's a decade of this data.
We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on.
So what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots, 4,000 deployments, a huge herculean task, 2,000 tags in an area, shown here for the first time, off the California coast, that appears to be a gathering place.
And then for sort of an encore from these animals, they're helping us.
They're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.
They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.
Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles.
This data, when visualized, is captivating to watch.
We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.
And then, as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues, we also think it's critical to get this information to the public, to engage the public with this kind of data.
We did this with the Great Turtle Race -- tagged turtles, brought in four million hits.
And now with Google's Oceans, we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.
And when we do and it swims, we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from California to Hawaii.
But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see.
We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.
We just need to put it together.
So in conclusion, we know where Yellowstone is for North America; it's off our coast.
We have the technology that's shown us where it is.
What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity.
How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere?
And then finally -- to basically get the message home -- maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks.
Make killer apps, if you will.
A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.
Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.
That way we do away with a few internet myths.
So we can save the bluefin tuna.
We can save the white shark.
We have the science and technology.
Hope is here. Yes we can.
We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans.
Thank you.

<title>Barbara Block: Tagging tuna in the deep ocean</title>
<description>Tuna are ocean athletes -- fast, far-ranging predators whose habits we're just beginning to understand. Marine biologist Barbara Block fits tuna with tracking tags that record unprecedented amounts of data about these gorgeous, threatened fish and the ocean habitats they move through.</description>

So if someone asked you for the three words that would sum up your reputation, what would you say?
How would people describe your judgment, your knowledge, your behaviors, in different situations?
Today I'd like to explore with you why the answer to this question will become profoundly important in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset.
I'd like to start by introducing you to someone whose life has been changed by a marketplace fueled by reputation.
Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host on Airbnb since 2008.
I caught up with him recently, where, over the course of several cups of tea, he told me how hosting guests from all over the world has enriched his life.
More than 50 people have come to stay in the 18th-century watchhouse he lives in with his cat, Squeak.
Now, I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guest happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen, and she promised that she would refrain from leaving a bad review on one condition: he got a cat.
And so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation.
Now, as many of you know, Airbnb is a peer-to-peer marketplace that matches people who have space to rent with people who are looking for a place to stay in over 192 countries.
The places being rented out are things that you might expect, like spare rooms and holiday homes, but part of the magic is the unique places that you can now access: treehouses, teepees, airplane hangars, igloos.
If you don't like the hotel, there's a castle down the road that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night.
It's a fantastic example of how technology is creating a market for things that never had a marketplace before.
Now let me show you these heat maps of Paris to see how insanely fast it's growing.
This image here is from 2008.
The pink dots represent host properties.
Even four years ago, letting strangers stay in your home seemed like a crazy idea.
Now the same view in 2010.
And now, 2012.
There is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris.
Now, what's happening here is people are realizing the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity and value of all kinds of assets, from skills to spaces to material possessions, in ways and on a scale never possible before.
It's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption, and, through it, people like Sebastian are becoming micro-entrepreneurs.
They're empowered to make money and save money from their existing assets.
But the real magic and the secret source behind collaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb isn't the inventory or the money.
It's using the power of technology to build trust between strangers.
This side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summer during the London riots.
He woke up around 9, and he checked his email and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him if he was okay.
Former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street, and wanted to check if he needed anything.
Sebastian actually said to me, he said, "Thirteen former guests contacted me before my own mother rang."
Now, this little anecdote gets to the heart of why I'm really passionate about collaborative consumption, and why, after I finished my book, I decided I'm going to try and spread this into a global movement.
Because at its core, it's about empowerment.
It's about empowering people to make meaningful connections, connections that are enabling us to rediscover a humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way, by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter, like Etsy, that are built on personal relationships versus empty transactions.
Now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behaviors that are hard-wired in all of us.
They're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant for the Facebook age.
We're literally beginning to realize that we have wired our world to share, swap, rent, barter or trade just about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar, our bikes on Spinlister, our offices on Loosecubes, our gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowing money from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club.
We are trading lessons on everything from sushi-making to coding on Skillshare, and we're even sharing our pets on DogVacay.
Now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption that's enabling us to match wants with haves in more democratic ways.
Now, collaborative consumption is creating the start of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand, but it's also a part of a massive value shift underway, where instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses, people are consuming to get to know the Joneses.
But the key reason why it's taking off now so fast is because every new advancement of technology increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust to make sharing easier and easier.
Now, I've looked at thousands of these marketplaces, and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients.
Let me give you an example.
Meet 46-year-old Chris Mok, who has, I bet, the best job title here of SuperRabbit.
Now, four years ago, Chris lost his job, unfortunately, as an art buyer at Macy's, and like so many people, he struggled to find a new one during the recession.
And then he happened to stumble across a post about TaskRabbit.
Now, the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so many great stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe.
Now what happened was, in February 2008, Leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them out for dinner, when Kobe came trotting up to them and he was salivating with saliva.
They realized they'd run out of dog food.
Kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow.
Now, later that evening, the two self-confessed tech geeks starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of eBay for errands existed.
Six months later, Leah quit her job, and TaskRabbit was born.
At the time, she didn't realize that she was actually hitting on a bigger idea she later called service networking.
It's essentially about how we use our online relationships to get things done in the real world.
Now the way TaskRabbit works is, people outsource the tasks that they want doing, name the price they're willing to pay, and then vetted Rabbits bid to run the errand.
Yes, there's actually a four-stage, rigorous interview process that's designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits.
Now, there's over 4,000 Rabbits across the United States and 5,000 more on the waiting list.
Now the tasks being posted are things that you might expect, like help with household chores or doing some supermarket runs.
I actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousand loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded through TaskRabbit.
But I love that the number one task posted, over a hundred times a day, is something that many of us have felt the pain of doing: yes, assembling Ikea furniture.
It's brilliant. Now, we may laugh, but Chris here is actually making up to 5,000 dollars a month running errands around his life.
And 70 percent of this new labor force were previously unemployed or underemployed.
I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant.
Now, when you think about it, it's amazing, right, that over the past 20 years, we've evolved from trusting people online to share information to trusting to handing over our credit card information, and now we're entering the third trust wave: connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds of people-powered marketplaces.
I actually came across this fascinating study by the Pew Center this week that revealed that an active Facebook user is three times as likely as a non-Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy.
Virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another face to face.
Now, with all of my optimism, and I am an optimist, comes a healthy dose of caution, or rather, an urgent need to address some pressing, complex questions.
How to ensure our digital identities reflect our real world identities? Do we want them to be the same?
How do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online?
How do we stop people who've behaved badly in one community doing so under a different guise?
In a similar way that companies often use some kind of credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan, or the rate of a mortgage, marketplaces that depend on transactions between relative strangers need some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian and Chris are good eggs, and that device is reputation.
Reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you.
Let's just take a look at Chris.
You can see that over 200 people have given him an average rating over 4.99 out of 5.
There are over 20 pages of reviews of his work describing him as super-friendly and fast, and he's reached level 25, the highest level, making him a SuperRabbit.
Now — -- I love that word, SuperRabbit.
And interestingly, what Chris has noted is that as his reputation has gone up, so has his chances of winning a bid and how much he can charge.
In other words, for SuperRabbits, reputation has a real world value.
Now, I know what you might be thinking.
Well, this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellers on eBay or star ratings on Amazon.
The difference today is that, with every trade we make, comment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn, we leave a reputation trail of how well we can and can't be trusted.
And it's not just the breadth but the volume of reputation data out there that is staggering.
Just consider this: Five million nights have been booked on Airbnb in the past six months alone.
30 million rides have been shared on Carpooling.com.
This year, two billion dollars worth of loans will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms.
This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data on how well we behave or misbehave.
Now, capturing and correlating the trails of information that we leave in different places is a massive challenge, but one we're being asked to figure out.
What the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask is, shouldn't they own their reputation data?
Shouldn't the reputation that he's personally invested on building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him from one community to another?
What I mean by this is, say he started selling second-hand books on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch?
It's a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney.
It was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn't travel with me.
I was essentially a ghost in the system.
Now I'm not suggesting that the next stage of the reputation economy is about adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score.
People's lives are too complex, and who wants to do that?
I also want to be clear that this isn't about adding up tweets and likes and friends in a clout-like fashion.
Those guys are measuring influence, not behaviors that indicate our trustworthiness.
But the most important thing that we have to keep in mind is that reputation is largely contextual.
Just because Sebastian is a wonderful host does not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture.
The big challenge is figuring out what data makes sense to pull, because the future's going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation, not a single algorithm.
It's only a matter of time before we'll be able to perform a Facebook- or Google-like search and see a complete picture of someone's behaviors in different contexts over time.
I envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you, when, where and why, your reliability on TaskRabbit, your cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb, the knowledge that you display on Quora or [unclear], they'll all live together in one place, and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard that will paint a picture of your reputation capital.
Now this is a concept that I'm currently researching and writing my next book on, and currently define as the worth of your reputation, your intentions, capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces.
This isn't some far-off frontier.
There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.
Now, I realize that this concept may sound a little Big Brother to some of you, and yes, there are some enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve, but ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation, we can actually control it more, and extract the immense value that will flow from it.
Also, more so than our credit history, we can actually shape our reputation.
Just think of Sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his.
I'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts, people [who] for whatever reason, are not active online, but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world?
How do we take their contributions to their jobs, their communities and their families, and convert that value into reputation capital?
Ultimately, when we get it right, reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power, trust and influence.
A three-digit score, your traditional credit history, that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is, will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost, what we can access, and, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world.
Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.
Reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me.
Now the interesting thing is, reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale, but the sources it will be generated from, and its applications, are far bigger than this space alone.
Let me give you one example from the world of recruiting, where reputation data will make the résumé seem like an archaic relic of the past.
Four years ago, tech bloggers and entrepreneurs Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, decided to start something called Stack Overflow.
Now, Stack Overflow is basically a platform where experienced programmers can ask other good programmers highly detailed technical questions on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions.
This site receives five and a half thousand questions a day, and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers.
Now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways, but it's basically by convincing their peers they know what they're talking about.
Now a few months after this site launched, the founders heard about something interesting, and it actually didn't surprise them.
What they heard was that users were putting their reputation scores on the top of their résumés, and that recruiters were searching the platform to find people with unique talents.
Now thousands of programmers today are finding better jobs this way, because Stack Overflow and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window into how someone really behaves, and what their peers think of them.
But the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow, I think, is incredibly exciting.
People are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has value beyond the environments from which it was built.
You know, it's very interesting.
When you talk to super-users, whether that's SuperRabbits or super-people on Stack Overflow, or Uberhosts, they all talk about how having a high reputation unlocks a sense of their own power.
On Stack Overflow, it creates a level playing field, enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top.
On Airbnb, the people often become more important than the spaces. On TaskRabbit, it gives people control of their economic activity.
Now at the end of my tea with Sebastian, he told me how, on a bad, rainy day, when he hasn't had a customer in his bookstore, he thinks of all the people around the world who've said something wonderful about him, and what that says about him as a person.
He's turning 50 this year, and he's convinced that the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life.
You know, there are only a few windows in history where the opportunity exists to reinvent We're living through one of those moments.
I believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution that will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution.
In the 20th century, the invention of traditional credit transformed our consumer system, and in many ways controlled who had access to what.
In the 21st century, new trust networks, and the reputation capital they generate, will reinvent the way we think about wealth, markets, power and personal identity, in ways we can't yet even imagine.
Thank you very much.

I want to say that really and truly, after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread, I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television.
So most everyone watches TV.
We like it. We like some parts of it.
Here in America, people actually love TV.
The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day.
Okay?
Now I happen to make my living these days in television, so for me, that's a good thing.
But a lot of people don't love it so much.
They, in fact, berate it.
They call it stupid, and worse, believe me.
My mother, growing up, she called it the "idiot box."
But my idea today is not to debate whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience.
So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral, political, social and emotional need states of our nation -- that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system.
So all these things are uniquely human, and they all add up to our idea of conscience.
Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV.
We're talking about popular TV.
We're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over the course of 50 years.
How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you've heard about, which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious, but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience?
How does television evolve over time, and what does this say about our society?
Now speaking of evolution, from basic biology, you probably remember that the animal kingdom, including humans, have four basic primal instincts.
You have hunger; you have sex; you have power; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness.
As humans, what's important to remember is that we've developed, we've evolved over time to temper, or tame, these basic animal instincts.
We have the capacity to laugh and cry.
We feel awe, we feel pity.
That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom.
The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained.
We love to watch TV.
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom.
Animals might love to play, but they don't love to watch.
So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious.
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has?
I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders.
Is television literally functioning as our conscience, tempting us and rewarding us at the same time?
So to begin to answer these questions, we did a research study.
We went back 50 years to the 1959/1960 television season.
We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows.
We talked to over 3,000 individuals -- almost 3,600 -- aged 18 to 70, and we asked them how they felt emotionally.
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows?
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity?
Did you feel outrage? Did you laugh?
What did this mean for you?
So to our global TED audiences, I want to say that this was a U.S. sample.
But as you can see, these emotional need states are truly universal.
And on a factual basis, over 80 percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows are exported around the world.
So I really hope our global audiences can relate.
Two acknowledgments before our first data slide: For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis, I thank legendary rabbi, Jack Stern.
And for the way in which I'm going to present the data, I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling, who you may have just seen.
Okay, here we go.
So here you see, from 1960 to 2010, the 50 years of our study.
Two things we're going to start with -- the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state, which, for this purpose, we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me, that make me feel much more positive about the world.
Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don't understand the difference between right and wrong.
As we start, you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady.
That's what we're watching TV for.
Moral ambiguity starts to climb.
Right at the end of the 60s, moral ambiguity is going up, inspiration is kind of on the wane.
Why?
The Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot, the Civil Rights movement, race riots, the Vietnam War, MLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot, Watergate.
Look what happens.
In 1970, inspiration plummets.
Moral ambiguity takes off.
They cross, but Ronald Reagan, a telegenic president, is in office.
It's trying to recover.
But look, it can't: AIDS, Iran-Contra, the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl.
Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years.
Take a look at this.
This chart is going to document a very similar trend.
But in this case, we have comfort -- the bubble in red -- social commentary and irreverence in blue and green.
Now this time on TV you have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke," you have "Andy Griffith," you have domestic shows all about comfort.
This is rising. Comfort stays whole.
Irreverence starts to rise.
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up.
You get to 1969, and look what happens.
You have comfort, irreverence, and social commentary, not only battling it out in our society, but you literally have two establishment shows -- "Gunsmoke" and "Gomer Pyle" -- in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows.
What's number one?
The socially irreverent hippie show, "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."
Viewers had responded dramatically.
Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show.
When you guys hear this industry term, a breakout hit, what does that mean?
It means in the 1966 television season, The "Smothers Brothers" came out of nowhere.
This was the first show that allowed viewers to say, "My God, I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War, about the presidency, through television?"
That's what we mean by a breakout show.
So then, just like the last chart, look what happens.
In 1970, the dam bursts. The dam bursts.
Comfort is no longer why we watch television.
Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s.
Now look at this.
The 70s means who? Norman Lear.
You have "All in the Family," "Sanford and Son," and the dominant show -- in the top-10 for the entire 70s -- "MAS*H."
In the entire 50 years of television that we studied, seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War, five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration.
Only one generation, 20 years in, and we discovered, Wow! TV can do that?
It can make me feel this?
It can change us?
So to this very, very savvy crowd, I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive.
Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago.
This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute: fantasy and imagination, which are shows defined as, "takes me out of my everyday realm" and "makes me feel better."
That's mapped against the red dot, unemployment, which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic.
You'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise, it maps to a spike in unemployment.
Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed?
No. In the 70s you have the bellwether show "The Bionic Woman" that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973, followed by the "Six Million-Dollar Man" and "Charlie's Angels."
Another spike in the 1980s -- another spike in shows about control and power.
What were those shows?
Glamorous and rich.
"Dallas," "Fantasy Island."
Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts: unemployment.
So here you are, in my favorite chart, because this is our last 20 years.
Whether or not you're in my business, you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV.
Well, as we say in the business, X marks the spot.
The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor -- we're watching "Friends," "Frasier," "Cheers" and "Seinfeld."
Everything's good, low unemployment.
But look: X marks the spot.
In 2001, the September 2001 television season, humor succumbs to judgment once and for all.
Why not?
We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court.
We had the bursting of the tech bubble.
We had 9/11.
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon.
Look what happens when we keep going.
At the turn of the century, the Internet takes off, reality television has taken hold.
What do people want in their TV then?
I would have thought revenge or nostalgia.
Give me some comfort; my world is falling apart.
No, they want judgment.
I can vote you off the island.
I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing.
I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired.
That's all great, right?
So as dramatically different as these television shows, pure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years -- what did I start with? -- one basic instinct remains.
We're animals, we need our moms.
There has not been a decade of television without a definitive, dominant TV mom.
The 1950s: June Cleever in the original comfort show, "Leave it to Beaver."
Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s.
Maude Findlay, the epitome of the irreverent 1970s, who tackled abortion, divorce, even menopause on TV.
The 1980s, our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington.
Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood.
This era's mom, Bree Van de Kamp.
Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience, sitting on television's shoulders, but I do know that I absolutely love this image.
So to you all, the women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen, the global audiences of TEDWomen, thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television.
But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television.
They give it life on television, for sure, but it's you as viewers, through your collective social consciences, that give it life, longevity, power or not.
So thanks very much.

I was afraid of womanhood.
Not that I'm not afraid now, but I've learned to pretend.
I've learned to be flexible.
In fact, I've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear.
Let me explain.
Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up, little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft, and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear what we were supposed to be.
There were plenty of role models all around us.
We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters, and of course, the ever-present media bombarding us with images and words, telling us how to be.
Now my mother was different.
She was a homemaker, but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together, and she didn't buy me pink outfits.
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.
And I just ate it up.
I drew, and I drew, and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family, I could draw, do what I wanted to do, and not have to perform, not have to speak -- I was very shy -- and I could still get approval.
I was launched as a cartoonist.
Now when we're young, we don't always know. We know there are rules out there, but we don't always know -- we don't perform them right, even though we are imprinted at birth with these things, and we're told what the most important color in the world is.
We're told what shape we're supposed to be in.
We're told what to wear -- -- and how to do our hair -- -- and how to behave.
Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture.
We're being corrected, and the primary policemen are women, because we are the carriers of the tradition.
We pass it down from generation to generation.
Not only that -- we always have this vague notion that something's expected of us.
And on top of all off these rules, they keep changing.
We don't know what's going on half the time, so it puts us in a very tenuous position.
Now if you don't like these rules, and many of us don't -- I know I didn't, and I still don't, even though I follow them half the time, not quite aware that I'm following them -- what better way than to change them [than] with humor?
Humor relies on the traditions of a society.
It takes what we know, and it twists it.
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress, and it makes it unexpected, and that's what elicits a laugh.
Now what if you put together women and humor?
I think you can get change.
Because women are on the ground floor, and we know the traditions so well, we can bring a different voice to the table.
Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos.
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.
during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations, the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement, and I think I was drawing, trying to figure out what was going on.
And then also my family was in chaos, and I drew to try to bring my family together -- -- try to bring my family together with laughter.
It didn't work.
My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.
But I found my place.
I found that I didn't have to wear high heels, I didn't have to wear pink, and I could feel like I fit in.
Now when I was a little older, in my 20s, I realized there are not many women in cartooning.
And I thought, "Well, maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning," and so I did. I became a cartoonist.
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking, "Well, why don't I do something?
I always loved political cartoons, so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh?"
Now my perspective is a particularly -- -- my perspective is a particularly American perspective.
I can't help it. I live here.
Even though I've traveled a lot, I still think like an American woman.
But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about are universal, of course -- that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions, and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S.
Consequently, we have.
Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition.
We have amazing antennae.
Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists, which I so enjoy, and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth, to get at the issues quickly and succinctly.
And not only that, it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect, but through the heart.
My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world -- countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Argentina, France -- and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties.
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances.
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them.
And we talk about how women have such strong perceptions, because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition-keepers, that we can have the great potential to be change-agents.
And I think, I truly believe, that we can change this thing one laugh at a time.
Thank you.

I have been teaching for a long time, and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students.
In 1931, my grandmother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- graduated from the eighth grade.
She went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived.
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head; and she needed to go there to get the information, because that's how you learned.
Fast-forward a generation: this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove, where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.
And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher, stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head, and take it with him, because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world.
When I was a kid, we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.
It was purchased the year I was born, and it was extraordinary, because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.
The information was inside my house and it was awesome.
This was different than either generation had experienced before, and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level.
But the information was closer to me.
I could get access to it.
In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching, we really see the advent of the Internet.
Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool, I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas, small town Kansas, where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely, small-town, rural Kansas school district, where I was teaching my favorite subject, American government.
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government, loved the political system.
Kids in the 12th grade: not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system.
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.
And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves.
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.
I posed a problem in front of them, which was to put on an election forum for their own community.
They produced fliers. They called offices.
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.
They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.
They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well, and really had this robust experiential learning.
The older teachers -- more experienced -- looked at me and went, "Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."
"She doesn't know what she's in for."
But I knew that the kids would show up, and I believed it, and I told them every week what I expected out of them.
And that night, all 90 kids -- dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.
I had to just sit and watch.
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.
It meant something to them.
And they will step up.
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona, where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years, this time with middle school students.
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.
Again, "thrilled" to learn.
But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona, was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school, and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.
And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina, which is the gentleman that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.
The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful, and they know what to do with it.
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive.
I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world, that they could identify that had done a similar thing.
I asked them to produce a little movie about it.
It's the first time we'd done this.
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer, but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.
It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves, what they're willing to share.
The last question of the assignment is: how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people?
The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary.
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy, which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia.
We are a nine through 12 public school, but we do school quite differently.
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned, and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past, of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school, and to a moment when we have information surplus.
So what do you do when the information is all around you?
Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information?
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program, so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday, taking them home, getting access to information.
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students, is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process.
We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test, and I am here to share with you: it is not learning.
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask, to tell kids to never be wrong.
To ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn.
So we did this project, and this is one of the artifacts of the project.
I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure.
My students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill.
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media, and take a look at what were the interesting components of it, and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history.
And they had certain criteria to do it.
They were a little uncomfortable with it, because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.
They can talk -- they're very smooth, and they can write very, very well, but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them.
But I gave them the room to just do the thing.
Go create. Go figure it out.
Let's see what we can do.
And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.
This was done in like two or three days.
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"
And they immediately went, "There it is."
Didn't read anything. "There it is."
And I said, "Well what makes it great?"
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.
And I said, "Go read it."
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."
And then we went to another one -- it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information -- and spent an hour talking about the learning process, because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect, or whether or not it was what I could create.
It asked them to create for themselves, and it allowed them to fail, process, learn from.
And when we do another round of this in my class this year, they will do better this time, because learning has to include an amount of failure, because failure is instructional in the process.
There are a million pictures that I could click through here, and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites -- of students learning, of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information, but instead, ask them what they can do with it.
Ask them really interesting questions.
They will not disappoint.
Ask them to go to places, to see things for themselves, to actually experience the learning, to play, to inquire.
This is one of my favorite photos, because this was taken on Tuesday, when I asked the students to go to the polls.
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting, and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.
But this is learning too, because we asked them to go out into real spaces.
The main point is that, if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning, empowering student voice and embracing failure, we're missing the mark.
And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities, because we won't get there with a standardized test, and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.
We know how to do this better, and it's time to do better.

I should tell you that when I was asked to be here, I thought to myself that well, it's TED.
And these TEDsters are -- you know, as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that?
And so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accent might help things a bit.
And then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because, after all, this is the great unveiling.
And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.
Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English because I am from Queens, New York.
But the theme of this session, of course, is invention.
And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of, you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.
I suppose it's fair to say that I am interested in the invention of self or selves.
We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits, unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.
But then what?
To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?
How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?
Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?
Well my characters, like the ones in my shows, allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.
And so I've brought a couple of them with me.
And well, they're very excited.
What I should tell you -- what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.
So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.
Okay. Okay. Oh, well.
Oh, wonderful.
Good evening everybody.
Thank you so very much for having me here today.
Ah, thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine.
Oh my! There's so many of you.
Hi sweetheart. Okay.
Anyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones.
She's a very nice, young black girl.
Well you know, she calls herself black -- she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.
But anyway.
She has me here because she puts me in her show, what she calls her one-woman show.
And you know what that means, of course.
That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.
But I don't mind.
Frankly, I'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.
Really, it's amazing.
Not only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities.
There are so many celebrities running around here.
I saw -- Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her.
And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.
Isn't that adorable?
So many others you see, they're just wonderful.
It's lovely to know they're concerned, you know.
And -- oh, I saw Goldie Hawn.
Oh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.
You know, she's only half Jewish.
Did you know that about her?
Yeah. But even so, a wonderful talent.
And I -- you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.
Yeah, she's lovely.
But anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.
It's such an eye-opening experience to be here.
You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.
You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.
And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time -- you're all so young.
You know, your parents must be very proud.
But I -- I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.
I noticed it's very multicultural.
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.
It's like a rainbow.
It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah.
I just -- I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.
What are you allowed to say or not say?
I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know.
But anyway, you know, I just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people -- literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.
You know, it's heartening to me.
Even though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying, absolutely horrifying.
It's true. It's true.
You know, between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.
And of course, we know it's all because of the -- all the ...
Well, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way: the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know, the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.
Anyway.
The point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess.
So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.
Thank you for all that you do.
And congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters.
So, happy continued success.
Congratulations. Mazel tov.
Hi. Hi.
Thank you everybody.
Sorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.
My name is Noraida. And I'm just -- I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference that you're doing and everything like that.
I am Dominican-American.
Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic, otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.
But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here, but I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.
And I think he's Mexican, so that's -- honestly, that's close enough for me right now. So -- I just -- I'm sorry.
I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything.
And I just -- you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.
And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.
Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me, as you can imagine.
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.
But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.
So then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.
And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.
Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.
Like, I love everything about this. It's amazing.
Like, it's -- I can't get over this right now.
And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from, that this even exists.
You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED.
I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like, you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know, which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.
I like that.
And actually, I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything.
Because, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now.
At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization, which is like a leadership thing, you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.
And the organization is called DA BOMB, A\and DA BOMB -- not like what you guys can build and everything -- it's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican -- it's an acronym -- Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.
So, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long, but with the war on terror and everything, the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever.
So, basically like DA BOMB -- what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does is, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me.
I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.
And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there.
I mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.
But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted.
Right now it's very exciting actually for me because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development -- that's my new title.
So, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me, like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.
And if everybody, like all people really had access to that, it would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.
So, I think all people, we need that, but especially, I look at people like me, you know like, I mean, Latinos -- we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.
So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.
So, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing, making the talks available online.
That's very good. I love that.
And I just -- I love you guys. I love TED.
And if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED as an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans.
Thank you very much.
So, that was Noraida, and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today, these are folks who are based on real people from my real life: friends, neighbors, family members.
I come from a multicultural family.
In fact, the older lady you just met: very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side.
It's a long story, believe me.
But on top of my family background, my parents also sent me to the United Nations school, where I encountered a plethora of new characters, including Alexandre, my French teacher, okay.
Well, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.
And it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].
It was like, you know, she was there in the class, you know, she was kind of typically French.
You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.
And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know, talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.
And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate.
But [German].
Yes, I took German for three years, [German], and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class, even in the UN school.
Although, you know, it was wonderful.
The teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.
Never. He always, always treated each of us, you know, equally unbearably during the class.
So, there were the teachers and then there were my friends, classmates from everywhere, many of whom are still dear friends to this day.
And they've inspired many characters as well.
For example, a friend of mine.
Well, I just wanted to quickly say good evening.
My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.
Of course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.
But, you know, I am originally from India, and I wanted to start by telling you that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to TED in California, originally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relieved because, you know, I am a human rights advocate.
And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.
And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians, trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown.
So, you can just imagine -- right.
So, but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here.
I wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great.
And, sadly, I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought, but -- I'm trying to behave myself, it's my first time here.
But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize, if you saw "Bridge and Tunnel."
Uh, well, thank you.
Good evening.
My name is Pauline Ning, and first I want to tell you that I'm -- of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED, I said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know -- before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people, much less like this because I did not like to give speeches because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.
But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, I try anyway.
My daughter -- my daughter wrote that, she told me, "Always start your speech with humor."
But my background -- I want to tell you story only briefly.
My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.
You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them, and they would always answer me back in English.
They love rock music, pop culture, American culture.
But when they got older, when the time comes for them to start think about getting married, that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.
But that's where we had some problems.
My son, he says he is not ready to get married.
And he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.
It's not that it's bad, but I told him, "What's wrong with a Chinese woman?"
But I think he will change his mind soon.
So, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter.
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom.
But first, she said she's not interested.
She only wants to spend time with her friends.
And then at college, it's like she never came home.
And she doesn't want me to come and visit.
So I said, "What's wrong in this picture?"
So, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.
But she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys because I don't like them."
And I said, "Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that."
She said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.
I am lesbian."
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas, but I told my daughter that this is one exception -- -- that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.
But she told me, "Mom, it's not American."
She said she is in love -- in love with a nice Chinese girl.
So, these are the words I am waiting to hear, but from my son, not my daughter.
But at first I did not know what to do.
But then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is.
So, even though sometimes it's still hard, I will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant, usually because of places like this, because of ideas like this, and people like you, with an open mind.
So I think maybe TED, you impact people's lives in the ways maybe even you don't realize.
So, for my daughter's sake, I thank you for your ideas worth spreading.
Thank you. Xie xie.
Good evening. My name is Habbi Belahal.
And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her to be last today.
I am originally from Jordan.
And I teach comparative literature at Queens College.
It is not Harvard.
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.
But I am very proud of my students.
And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.
So you will get the extra credit I promised you.
But, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say, I do like to make the point that we in global society, we are never as different as the appearances may suggest.
So, if you will indulge me, I will share quickly with you a bit of verse, which I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.
So, back in the ancient times.
[Arabic] And this roughly translates: "Please, let me hold your hand.
I want to hold your hand.
I want to hold your hand.
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside.
It's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide."
Well, so okay, but please, please, but please.
If it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my life listening to the Beatles.
On the radio [unclear], they were very popular.
So, all of that is to say that I like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another, there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.
And I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.
That's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.
Okay? Great.
Thank you all very much. It was lovely.
Thank you for having me.
Thank you very, very much. I love you.
Well, you have to let me say this.
I just -- thank you.
I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.
It's been a long time coming, and I feel like I'm home.
And I know I've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere, but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced.
The whole thing is amazing, and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon.

<title>Sarah Jones: A one-woman global village</title>

I'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV/AIDS campaigner.
And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.
In November of 2003, I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela's 46664 Foundation -- that is his HIV/AIDS foundation.
And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.
And that's me with Youssou N'Dour, onstage, having the time of my life.
The next day, all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island, where he was going to give a conference to the world's press, standing in front of his former prison cell.
You can see the bars of the window there.
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.
In that moment in time, Mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation, a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims, the most vulnerable of all, were women and children.
This was a huge impact on my mind, because I am a woman and I am a mother, and I hadn't realized that the HIV/AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way.
And so I committed -- when I left South Africa, when I left Capetown, I told myself, "This is going to be something that I have to talk about.
I have to serve."
And so, subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences, interviews, talking and using my platform as a musician, with my commitment to Mandela -- out of respect for the tremendous, unbelievable work that he had done.
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela, everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.
But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa, his country, the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus?
I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there, they would be shocked.
I was very, very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat, the founder of Treatment Action Campaign, an incredible campaigner and activist.
I met him at a 46664 event.
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.
This is a tool -- this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV, people who are living with HIV.
And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt I say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue.
It doesn't have to be in the closet."
I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization.
It's a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women, most of whom are HIV-positive.
They work in the field.
They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus.
They have education programs.
They bring out the issues of stigma.
It's quite extraordinary what they do.
And yes, my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds.
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do, and are still continuing to do in South Africa.
So this is my SING Campaign.
SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me.
I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- I went to about 12 different countries.
Here I am in Oslo in Norway, getting a nice, fat check; singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.
In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart, the whole nature, of this terrible tragedy that is taking place, that people are tending to avoid, because they are fatigued, and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.
Aaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister, attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him, and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change, which is absolutely necessary.
This is in the Scottish Parliament.
I've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV.
And I was showing them my experiences and trying to, again, raise awareness.
And once again, in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus.
I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe -- he's the director of UNAIDS.
And I'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me, only a few months ago, to become a UNAIDS ambassador.
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach.
The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015.
It's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will.
This can happen.
And here I am with a pregnant woman, who is HIV positive and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident, because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.
And her baby will receive PMTCT, which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus.
Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life.
It's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic.
Now, I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile.
This is Avelile -- she goes with me wherever I go.
I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV/AIDS orphans.
Avelile's mother had HIV virus -- she died from AIDS-related illness.
Avelile had the virus, she was born with the virus.
And here she is at seven years old, weighing no more than a one year-old baby.
At this point in her life, she's suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia.
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.
They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her.
And we didn't know when we left the hospital -- because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive.
So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience, this one child, you know, that story.
Five months later, we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again.
And I'm getting -- the hairs on my -- I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.
They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.
This is the transformation that took place.
Isn't it extraordinary?
That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.
So, I would like to say to you, each one in the audience, if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care, and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals, specifically five and six, should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world -- especially in sub-Saharan Africa -- could you please stand up.
I think that's fair to say, it's almost everyone in the hall.
Thank you very much.

So I begin with an advertisement inspired by George Orwell that Apple ran in 1984.
Big Brother: We are one people with one will, one resolve, one cause.
Our enemies shall talk themselves to death, and we will fight them with their own confusion.
We shall prevail.
On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.
And you'll see why 1984 won't be like "1984."
Rebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today.
Technology created by innovative companies will set us all free.
Fast-forward more than two decades: Apple launches the iPhone in China and censors the Dalai Lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the Chinese government for its Chinese app store.
The American political cartoonist Mark Fiore also had his satire application censored in the United States because some of Apple's staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.
His app wasn't reinstated until he won the Pulitzer Prize.
The German magazine Stern, a news magazine, had its app censored because the Apple nannies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users, and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on newsstands throughout Germany.
And more controversially, recently, Apple censored a Palestinian protest app after the Israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks.
So here's the thing.
We have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies.
Or they're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed.
Or they're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many, or most, of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question.
So here's the situation.
In a pre-Internet world, sovereignty over our physical freedoms, or lack thereof, was controlled almost entirely by nation-states.
But now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace.
And their decisions about software coding, engineering, design, terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.
And their sovereignties, cross-cutting, globally interlinked, can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation-states in very exciting ways, but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and cannot do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world.
After all, even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year.
And these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in Tunisia and Egypt this past spring and beyond.
As Wael Ghonim, the Google-Egyptian-executive by day, secret-Facebook-activist by night, famously said to CNN after Mubarak stepped down, "If you want to liberate a society, just give them the Internet."
But overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated.
On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist who was part of the storming of the Egyptian state security offices in March.
And many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles.
But some of the files were left behind intact, and activists, some of them, found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges, their cellphone text message exchanges, even Skype conversations.
And one activist actually found a contract from a Western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the Egyptian security forces.
And Egyptian activists are assuming that these technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there.
And in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May -- not nearly as extensively as under President Ben Ali.
But you'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain Facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence.
In protest over this, blogger Slim Amamou, who had been jailed under Ben Ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution, he resigned in protest from the cabinet.
But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem.
In fact, on Twitter, there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said, "Well actually, we do want democracy and free expression, but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.
But the problem is, how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power?
As Riadh Guerfali, the veteran digital activist from Tunisia, remarked over this incident, "Before, things were simple: you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.
Today, things are a lot more subtle."
Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends.
The reality is that even in democratic societies today, we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks.
In fact, in the United States, whatever you may think of Julian Assange, even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.
Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, despite the fact that Wikileaks had not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime.
So we assume that the Internet is a border-busting technology.
This is a map of social networks worldwide, and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing, depending on how you like the way Facebook manages its service.
But borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace.
In Brazil and Japan, it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.
But if you look at China, Vietnam and a number of the former Soviet states, what's happening there is more troubling.
You have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where, effectively, the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government.
Now in China, you have the "great firewall," as it's well-known, that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google+ and many of the other overseas websites.
And that's done in part with the help from Western technology.
But that's only half of the story.
The other part of the story are requirements that the Chinese government places on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet, known as a system of self-discipline.
In plain English, that means censorship and surveillance of their users.
And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009 where the Internet Society of China presented awards to the top 20 Chinese companies that are best at exercising self-discipline -- i.e. policing their content.
And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, China's dominant search engine, was one of the recipients.
In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet and directly censor websites.
But this is a website called Rospil that's an anti-corruption site.
And earlier this year, there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to Rospil through a payments processing system called Yandex Money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to Rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at Yandex Money.
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable.
So we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the Internet, which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services.
So the important question, I think, is not this debate over whether the Internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
Of course, it's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the Internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is.
The most urgent question we need to be asking today is how do we make sure that the Internet evolves in a citizen-centric manner.
Because I think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens, and I would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives, not to manipulate or enslave us.
So the question is, we know how to hold government accountable.
We don't necessarily always do it very well, but we have a sense of what the models are, politically and institutionally, to do that.
How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most CEO's argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit?
And government regulation often isn't helping all that much.
You have situations, for instance, in France where president Sarkozy tells the CEO's of Internet companies, "We're the only legitimate representatives of the public interest."
But then he goes and champions laws like the infamous "three-strikes" law that would disconnect citizens from the Internet for file sharing, which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens' right to communications, and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.
And here in the United Kingdom there's also concern over a law called the Digital Economy Act that's placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior.
So what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen-centric Internet in the future, we need a broader and more sustained Internet freedom movement.
After all, companies didn't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course, or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course, just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do.
It was the result of decades of sustained activism, shareholder advocacy and consumer advocacy.
Similarly, governments don't enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day.
It's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism that you get the right regulations, and that you get the right corporate behavior.
We need to make the same approach with the Internet.
We also are going to need political innovation.
Eight hundred years ago, approximately, the barons of England decided that the Divine Right of Kings was no longer working for them so well, and they forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, which recognized that even the king who claimed to have divine rule still had to abide by a basic set of rules.
This set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation, which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed -- which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in America across the pond.
So now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked.
And what does that look like?
At the moment, we still don't know.
But it's going to require innovation that's not only going to need to focus on politics, on geopolitics, but it's also going to need to deal with questions of business management, investor behavior, consumer choice and even software design and engineering.
Each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world's people and not the other way around.
Thank you very much.

<title>Rebecca MacKinnon: Let's take back the Internet!</title>
<description>In this powerful talk from TEDGlobal, Rebecca MacKinnon describes the expanding struggle for freedom and control in cyberspace, and asks: How do we design the next phase of the Internet with accountability and freedom at its core, rather than control? She believes the internet is headed for a "Magna Carta" moment when citizens around the world demand that their governments protect free speech and their right to connection.</description>

Well, this is 2009.
And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin.
And all over the world, eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this.
And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life, and how he changed our thinking.
I say almost every aspect, because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on.
And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else.
So I'm going to talk about it.
It's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees?
We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference, very, very closely related.
And yet, when you look at the phenotypes, there's a chimp, there's a man; they're astoundingly different, no resemblance at all.
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology, or behavior.
I'm talking about ground-base, nitty-gritty, measurable physical differences.
They, that one, is hairy and walking on four legs.
That one is a naked biped. Why?
I mean -- if I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe there's a reason for that.
If we changed so much, something must have happened.
What happened?
Now 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question.
Everybody knew the answer.
They knew what happened.
The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees; our ancestors went out onto the plain.
That explained everything.
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass, or to chase after animals, or to free our hands for weapons.
And we got so overheated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.
Everybody knew that, for generations.
But then, in the '90s, something began to unravel.
The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and place as the hominids.
And they weren't savanna species.
And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores.
And then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen.
Shock, horror.
The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation.
Some of it even came from lianas, those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.
So we're left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees, before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence.
This is not something I've made up.
It's not a minority theory.
Everybody agrees with it.
Professor Tobias came over from South Africa and spoke to University College London.
He said, "Everything I've been telling you for the last 20 years, forget about it. It was wrong.
We've got to go back to square one and start again."
It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one.
I mean, it's a terrible thing to happen.
You've got this beautiful paradigm.
You've believed it through generations.
Nobody has questioned it.
You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it, relying on it to be as solid as a rock.
And now it's whipped away from under you.
What do you do? What does a scientist do in that case?
Well, we know the answer because Thomas S. Kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in 1962.
He said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened.
If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.
So they say, "Yes it's wrong, but supposing it was right ..."
And the only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions.
So that is what they have done now.
That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question.
Some of them have even elevated it into a principle.
It's what we ought to be doing.
Aaron Filler from Harvard said, "Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?
I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes.
And we just record what we see."
Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!
He knew all about that kind of science.
And he called it hypothesis-free science.
And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.
And if you're going to say, "I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures," you can take "The Origin of Species" and throw it out of the window, for it's about nothing else but selective pressures.
And the irony of it is, that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up.
There was one waiting in the wings.
when Alister Hardy, a marine biologist, said, "I think what happened, perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time."
He kept it to himself for 30 years.
But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.
All his colleagues said, "This is outrageous.
You've exposed us to public ridicule!
You must never do that again."
And at that time, it became set in stone: the aquatic theory should be dumped with the UFOs and the yetis, as part of the lunatic fringe of science.
Well I don't think that.
I think that Hardy had a lot going for him.
I'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind, the things that made us different from everybody else, and all our relatives.
Let's look at our naked skin.
It's obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair, are aquatic ones, like the dugong, the walrus, the dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee.
And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.
And you're tempted to think, well perhaps, could that be why we are naked?
I suggested it and people said, "No no no.
I mean, look at the elephant.
You've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you?"
So back in 1982 I said, "Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor."
Peals of merry laughter!
"That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she?"
But by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.
This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors.
The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.
Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said, "Seems to have spent most of its time in the water."
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water.
As an absolute connection, it only works one way.
You can't say all aquatic animals are naked, because look at the sea otter.
But you can say that every animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime, or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.
The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat, which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.
And take bipedality.
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with, because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.
But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs, if they want to, for a short time.
There is only one circumstance in which they always, all of them, walk on two legs, and that is when they are wading through water.
Do you think that's significant?
David Attenborough thinks it's significant, as the possible beginning of our bipedalism.
Look at the fat layer.
We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over: nothing in the least like that in any other primate.
Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals, the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall, around the kidneys and the intestines and so on, has started to migrate to the outside, and spread out in a layer inside the skin.
In the whale it's complete: no fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.
We cannot avoid the suspicion that in our case it's started to happen.
We have got skin lined with this layer.
It's the only possible explanation of why humans, if they're very unlucky, can become grossly obese, in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.
Something very odd, matter-of-factly, never explained.
The question of why we can speak.
We can speak.
And the gorilla can't speak. Why?
Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that -- purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.
You can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request.
The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds.
It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak.
And then again, there is the fact that we are streamlined.
Trying to imagine a diver diving into water -- hardly makes a splash.
Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver, and you can see that, compared with gorilla, we are halfway to being shaped like a fish.
I am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years, this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe, and it is not lunatic fringe.
And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own, which they've all agreed on, and they love.
There is nothing there.
They are staving off the aquatic theory to protect a vacuum.
How do they react when I say these things?
One very common reaction I've heard about 20 times is, "But it was investigated.
They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning, when Hardy put forward his article."
I don't believe it.
For 35 years I've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind, and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths.
It's never been done.
I ask people sometimes, and they say, "I like the aquatic theory!
Everybody likes the aquatic theory.
Of course they don't believe it, but they like it."
Well I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?"
They say "Well ...
everybody I talk to says it's rubbish.
And they can't all be wrong, can they?"
The answer to that, loud and clear, is, "Yes! They can all be wrong."
History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong.
And if you've got a scientific problem like that, you can't solve it by holding a head count, and saying, "More of us say yes than say no."
Apart from that, some of the heads count more than others.
Some of them have come over.
There was Professor Tobias. He's come over.
Sir David Attenborough, he's come over.
Anybody else out there? Come on in.
The water is lovely.
And now we've got to look to the future.
Ultimately one of three things is going to happen.
Either they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years.
"Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting."
That would be very sad.
The second thing that could happen is that some young genius will arrive, and say, "I've found it.
It was not the savanna, it was not the water, it was this!"
No sign of that happening either.
I don't think there is a third option.
So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing.
If you look back at the early years of the last century, there was a stand-off, a lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in Mendel, and the believers in Darwin.
It ended with a new synthesis: Darwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas blending together.
And I think the same thing will happen here.
You'll get a new synthesis.
Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas will be blended together.
And we can move forward from there, and really get somewhere.
That would be a beautiful thing.
It would be very nice for me if it happened soon.
Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said, "At my age, I don't even buy green bananas."
So if it's going to come and it's going to happen, what's holding it up?
I can tell you that in three words.
Academia says no.
They decided in 1960, "That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis."
And it's not easy to change their minds.
The professional journals won't touch it with a barge pole.
The textbooks don't mention it.
The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked, let alone look for a reason to it.
"Horizon," which takes its cue from the academics, won't touch it with a barge pole.
So we never hear the case put for it, except in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe.
I don't know quite where this diktat comes from.
Somebody up there is issuing the commandment, "Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory.
And if you hope to make progress in this profession, and you do believe it, you'd better keep it to yourself, because it will get in your way."
So I get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are morphing into a kind of priesthood.
But you know, that makes me feel good, because Richard Dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood.
He says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence it's been trained to receive."
Right. I'll go ahead with that.
And secondly, he says, "You must never be afraid to rock the boat."
I'll go along with that too.
Thank you very much.

<title>Elaine Morgan: I believe we evolved from aquatic apes</title>
<description>Elaine Morgan was a tenacious proponent of a theory that is, ahem, not widely accepted. The aquatic ape hypothesis lays out the idea that humans evolved from primate ancestors who dwelt in watery habitats. Hear her spirited defense of the idea -- and her theory on why science doesn't take it seriously.</description>

My name is Kate Hartman.
And I like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate.
So I'm specifically interested in how we, as humans, relate to ourselves, each other and the world around us.
So just to give you a bit of context, as June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator.
I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics.
And much of what I do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form.
And so anytime I talk about what I do, I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter.
And it's pretty simple.
Everybody's got one -- all of you.
I can guarantee, everyone in this room, all of you over there, the people in the cushy seats, the people up top with the laptops -- we all have bodies.
Don't be ashamed.
It's something that we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world.
And so when working as an interaction designer, or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on, in or around the human form -- it's really a powerful space to work within.
So within my own work, I use a broad range of materials and tools.
So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing.
And to tell you a bit about the things that I make, the easiest place to start the story is with a hat.
And so it all started several years ago, late one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home, and I was thinking.
And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little.
And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else.
And so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.
And I called it the Muttering Hat, because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you, but you could detach them and share them with somebody else.
So I make other hats as well.
This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat.
It's fairly self-explanatory.
It physically carves out conversation space for one.
And when you speak out loud, the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.
And so when I make these things, it's really not so much about the object itself, but rather the negative space around the object.
So what happens when a person puts this thing on?
What kind of an experience do they have?
And how are they transformed by wearing it?
So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener.
And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards.
And so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication.
And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves.
So they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions.
So they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst.
And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences.
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.
And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange, but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered.
And in the end, some of these things just act as invitations.
So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say.
So even though I'm really interested in the relationship between people, I also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us.
And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back, I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them.
And I thought, "Well, hey!
Maybe if I want to better relate to walls, maybe I need to be more wall-like myself."
So I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack.
And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me.
And so jumping off of that, thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world, I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls -- which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols.
So when a plant is thirsty, it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter.
And so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic, because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time.
And so kind of thinking about scale, my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers -- of course.
And so glaciers are these magnificent beings, and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them, but what I'm particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations.
Because there seems to be an issue.
The glaciers are actually leaving us.
They're both shrinking and retreating -- and some of them have disappeared altogether.
And so I actually live in Canada now, so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers.
And this one's particularly interesting, because, of all the glaciers in North America, it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year.
They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier.
And this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter.
When I meet a glacier for the very first time, what do I do?
There's no kind of social protocol for this.
I really just don't even know how to say hello.
Do I carve a message in the snow?
Or perhaps I can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes -- ice cube Morse code.
Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool, like an icy megaphone that I can use to amplify my voice when I direct it at the ice.
But really the most satisfying experience I've had is the act of listening, which is what we need in any good relationship.
And I was really struck by how much it affected me.
This very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier.
And so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days, I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.
And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice.
And once again, it's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug.
So, yea, this is actually just the beginning.
These are initial musings for this project.
And just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like, with this project, I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace.
And so my intent is to actually just take the next 10 years and go on a series of collaborative projects where I work with people from different disciplines -- artists, technologists, scientists -- to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human-glacier relations.
So beyond that, in closing, I'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation, and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy, but I think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world.
Thanks.

All buildings today have something in common.
They're made using Victorian technologies.
This involves blueprints, industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers.
All of this effort results in an inert object.
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities.
This is not sustainable.
I believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature, not insulating them from it.
Now, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language.
Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world, through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.
And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another, either through the production or the absorption of energy.
And this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way.
So, I'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture.
But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.
I'm working with architect Neil Spiller at the Bartlett School of Architecture, and we're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach.
That means we're generating them from scratch.
One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc, and he's really interested in the transition from inert to living matter.
Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in, when we're thinking about sustainable materials.
So, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.
Now all this is -- and it's magic -- is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.
And it has no DNA.
This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living.
It is able to move around its environment.
It can follow chemical gradients.
It can undergo complex reactions, some of which are happily architectural.
So here we are. These are protocells, patterning their environment.
We don't know how they do that yet.
Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.
Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.
This is a violent process.
Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate.
And that's the shell around that globular fat.
They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.
So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture, which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods which impose structure upon matter.
That can't be energetically sensible.
So, bottom-up materials actually exist today.
They've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.
If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today, and have a look at the brickwork, which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days, you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.
And if you look even closer, you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other.
And then they are fossilized over millions of years.
Now a block of limestone, in itself, isn't particularly that interesting.
It looks beautiful.
But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere.
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide.
Would it give this block of limestone new properties?
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.
It might be able to self-repair, and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment.
So, architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material.
They think big. Okay?
So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials, we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls, or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water.
So, one of these examples would of course be the historic city of Venice.
Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea, and is built upon wooden piles.
So we've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we're working with to sustainably reclaim Venice.
And architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city.
So, here is the technology we have today.
This is our protocell technology, effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers, and depositing it in a very complex environment, against natural materials.
We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.
Now, this is the very interesting part.
We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.
creatively crafted around the wooden piles.
So, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light, toward the dark foundations.
We've observed this in the laboratory.
The protocells can actually move away from the light.
They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.
So that these don't just exist as one entity, we kind of chemically engineer them.
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically, around the foundations of Venice, effectively petrifying it.
Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.
But gradually, as the buildings are repaired, we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.
Also it will attract the local marine ecology, who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.
So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way.
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.
This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it, which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries.
So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies, and building architectures from a bottom-up approach.
Secondly, these metabolic materials have some of the properties of living systems, which means they can perform in similar ways.
They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture.
And finally, an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one.
Thank you.

<title>Rachel Armstrong: Architecture that repairs itself?</title>
<description>Venice is sinking. To save it, Rachel Armstrong says we need to outgrow architecture made of inert materials and, well, make architecture that grows itself. She proposes a not-quite-alive material that does its own repairs and sequesters carbon, too.</description>

So I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia.
I've spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals.
I might have ended up spending most of my life on the back ward of a hospital, but that isn't how my life turned out.
In fact, I've managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades, perhaps my proudest accomplishment.
That's not to say that I've remained clear of all psychiatric struggles.
After I graduated from the Yale Law School and got my first law job, my New Haven analyst, Dr. White, announced to me that he was going to close his practice in three months, several years before I had planned to leave New Haven.
White had been enormously helpful to me, and the thought of his leaving shattered me.
My best friend Steve, sensing that something was terribly wrong, flew out to New Haven to be with me.
Now I'm going to quote from some of my writings: "I opened the door to my studio apartment.
Steve would later tell me that, for all the times he had seen me psychotic, nothing could have prepared him for what he saw that day.
For a week or more, I had barely eaten.
I was gaunt. I walked as though my legs were wooden.
My face looked and felt like a mask.
I had closed all the curtains in the apartment, so in the middle of the day the apartment was in near total darkness.
The air was fetid, the room a shambles.
Steve, both a lawyer and a psychologist, has treated many patients with severe mental illness, and to this day he'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen.
'Hi,' I said, and then I returned to the couch, where I sat in silence for several moments.
'Thank you for coming, Steve.
Crumbling world, word, voice.
Tell the clocks to stop.
Time is. Time has come.' 'White is leaving,' Steve said somberly.
'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,' I moan.
'Gravity is pulling me down.
I'm scared. Tell them to get away.'" As a young woman, I was in a psychiatric hospital on three different occasions for lengthy periods.
My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia, and gave me a prognosis of "grave."
That is, at best, I was expected to live in a board and care, and work at menial jobs.
Fortunately, I did not actually enact that grave prognosis.
Instead, I'm a chaired Professor of Law, Psychology and Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law, I have many close friends and I have a beloved husband, Will, who's here with us today.
Thank you.
He's definitely the star of my show.
I'd like to share with you how that happened, and also describe my experience of being psychotic.
I hasten to add that it's my experience, because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way.
Let's start with the definition of schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia is a brain disease.
Its defining feature is psychosis, or being out of touch with reality.
Delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness.
Delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren't responsive to evidence, and hallucinations are false sensory experiences.
For example, when I'm psychotic I often have the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts.
I sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain.
Occasionally, I have hallucinations, like one time I turned around and saw a man with a raised knife.
Imagine having a nightmare while you're awake.
Often, speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence.
Loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don't make sense, and if the words get jumbled up enough, it's called "word salad."
Contrary to what many people think, schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality.
The schizophrenic mind is not split, but shattered.
Everyone has seen a street person, unkempt, probably ill-fed, standing outside of an office building muttering to himself or shouting.
This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia.
But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status, and there are people with the illness who are full-time professionals with major responsibilities.
Several years ago, I decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey, and I want to share some more of that story with you today to convey the inside view.
So the following episode happened the seventh week of my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School.
Quoting from my writings: "My two classmates, Rebel and Val, and I had made the date to meet in the law school library on Friday night to work on our memo assignment together.
But we didn't get far before I was talking in ways that made no sense.
'Memos are visitations,' I informed them.
'They make certain points. The point is on your head.
Pat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone?' Rebel and Val looked at me as if they or I had been splashed in the face with cold water.
'What are you talking about, Elyn?' 'Oh, you know, the usual. Who's what, what's who, heaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof.
It's a flat surface. It's safe.' Rebel and Val followed and they asked what had gotten into me.
'This is the real me,' I announced, waving my arms above my head.
And then, late on a Friday night, on the roof of the Yale Law School, I began to sing, and not quietly either.
'Come to the Florida sunshine bush.
Do you want to dance?' 'Are you on drugs?' one asked. 'Are you high?' 'High? Me? No way, no drugs.
Come to the Florida sunshine bush, where there are lemons, where they make demons.' 'You're frightening me,' one of them said, and Rebel and Val headed back into the library.
I shrugged and followed them.
Back inside, I asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as I was.
'I think someone's infiltrated my copies of the cases,' I said.
'We've got to case the joint.
I don't believe in joints, but they do hold your body together.'" -- It's an example of loose associations. -- "Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room, and once there, I couldn't settle down.
My head was too full of noise, too full of orange trees and law memos I could not write and mass murders I knew I would be responsible for.
Sitting on my bed, I rocked back and forth, moaning in fear and isolation."
This episode led to my first hospitalization in America.
I had two earlier in England.
Continuing with the writings: "The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment, and I began gibbering unintelligably as I had the night before, and he eventually brought me to the emergency room.
Once there, someone I'll just call 'The Doctor' and his whole team of goons swooped down, lifted me high into the air, and slammed me down on a metal bed with such force that I saw stars.
Then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed with thick leather straps.
A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before: half groan, half scream, barely human and pure terror.
Then the sound came again, forced from somewhere deep inside my belly and scraping my throat raw."
This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization.
One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me against my will was that I was "gravely disabled."
To support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unable to do my Yale Law School homework.
I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven.
During the next year, I would spend five months in a psychiatric hospital.
At times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints, arms tied, arms and legs tied down, arms and legs tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest.
I never struck anyone.
I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.
If you've never been restrained yourself, you may have a benign image of the experience.
There's nothing benign about it.
Every week in the United States, it's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints.
They strangle, they aspirate their vomit, they suffocate, they have a heart attack.
It's unclear whether using mechanical restraints is actually saving lives or costing lives.
While I was preparing to write my student note for the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints, I consulted an eminent law professor who was also a psychiatrist, and said surely he would agree that restraints must be degrading, painful and frightening.
He looked at me in a knowing way, and said, "Elyn, you don't really understand: These people are psychotic.
They're different from me and you.
They wouldn't experience restraints as we would."
I didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that, no, we're not that different from him.
We don't like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would.
In fact, until very recently, and I'm sure some people still hold it as a view, that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe.
I've never met a psychiatric patient who agreed with that view.
Today, I'd like to say I'm very pro-psychiatry but very anti-force.
I don't think force is effective as treatment, and I think using force is a terrible thing to do to another person with a terrible illness.
Eventually, I came to Los Angeles to teach at the University of Southern California Law School.
For years, I had resisted medication, making many, many efforts to get off.
I felt that if I could manage without medication, I could prove that, after all, I wasn't really mentally ill, it was some terrible mistake.
My motto was the less medicine, the less defective.
My L.A. analyst, Dr. Kaplan, was urging me just to stay on medication and get on with my life, but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off.
Quoting from the text: "I started the reduction of my meds, and within a short time I began feeling the effects.
After returning from a trip to Oxford, I marched into Kaplan's office, headed straight for the corner, crouched down, covered my face, and began shaking.
All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers.
They'd slice me up in thin slices or make me swallow hot coals.
Kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.' Even in this state, what he accurately described as acutely and forwardly psychotic, I refused to take more medication.
The mission is not yet complete.
Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan, I went to see Dr. Marder, a schizophrenia expert who was following me for medication side effects.
He was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness.
Once in his office, I sat on his couch, folded over, and began muttering.
'Head explosions and people trying to kill.
Is it okay if I totally trash your office?' 'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that,' said Marder.
'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me.
Tell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong?
Hundreds of thousands with thoughts, interdiction.' 'Elyn, do you feel like you're dangerous to yourself or others?
I think you need to be in the hospital.
I could get you admitted right away, and the whole thing could be very discrete.' 'Ha, ha, ha.
You're offering to put me in hospitals?
Hospitals are bad, they're mad, they're sad.
One must stay away. I'm God, or I used to be.'" At that point in the text, where I said "I'm God, or I used to be," my husband made a marginal note.
He said, "Did you quit or were you fired?"
"'I give life and I take it away.
Forgive me, for I know not what I do.' Eventually, I broke down in front of friends, and everybody convinced me to take more medication.
I could no longer deny the truth, and I could not change it.
The wall that kept me, Elyn, Professor Saks, separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past, lay smashed and in ruins."
Everything about this illness says I shouldn't be here, but I am. And I am, I think, for three reasons: First, I've had excellent treatment.
Four- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy for decades and continuing, and excellent psychopharmacology.
Second, I have many close family members and friends who know me and know my illness.
These relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth, and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of symptoms.
Third, I work at an enormously supportive workplace at USC Law School.
This is a place that not only accommodates my needs but actually embraces them.
It's also a very intellectually stimulating place, and occupying my mind with complex problems has been my best and most powerful and most reliable defense against my mental illness.
Even with all that — excellent treatment, wonderful family and friends, supportive work environment — I did not make my illness public until relatively late in life, and that's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing.
If you hear nothing else today, please hear this: There are not "schizophrenics."
There are people with schizophrenia, and these people may be your spouse, they may be your child, they may be your neighbor, they may be your friend, they may be your coworker.
So let me share some final thoughts.
We need to invest more resources into research and treatment of mental illness.
The better we understand these illnesses, the better the treatments we can provide, and the better the treatments we can provide, the more we can offer people care, and not have to use force.
Also, we must stop criminalizing mental illness.
It's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States.
American prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer from severe mental illness, and many of them are there because they never received adequate treatment.
I could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself.
A message to the entertainment industry and to the press: On the whole, you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds.
Please, continue to let us see characters in your movies, your plays, your columns, who suffer with severe mental illness.
Portray them sympathetically, and portray them in all the richness and depth of their experience as people and not as diagnoses.
Recently, a friend posed a question: If there were a pill I could take that would instantly cure me, would I take it?
The poet Rainer Maria Rilke was offered psychoanalysis.
He declined, saying, "Don't take my devils away, because my angels may flee too."
My psychosis, on the other hand, is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying that all my angels have already fled.
So would I take the pill? In an instant.
That said, I don't wish to be seen as regretting the life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill, nor am I asking anyone for their pity.
What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share is more important than the mental illness we may not.
What those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everybody wants: in the words of Sigmund Freud, "to work and to love."
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. You're very kind.
Thank you.

<title>Elyn Saks: A tale of mental illness -- from the inside</title>
<description>"Is it okay if I totally trash your office?" It's a question Elyn Saks once asked her doctor, and it wasn't a joke. A legal scholar, in 2007 Saks came forward with her own story of schizophrenia, controlled by drugs and therapy but ever-present. In this powerful talk, she asks us to see people with mental illness clearly, honestly and compassionately.</description>

Four years ago today, exactly, actually, I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie.
Last September of 2011, I started an online magazine for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com.
My name's Tavi Gevinson, and the title of my talk is "Still Figuring It Out," and the MS Paint quality of my slides was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme, and has nothing to do with my inability to use PowerPoint.
So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist.
I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about what makes a strong female character, and, you know, movies and TV shows, these things have influence. My own website.
So I think the question of what makes a strong female character often goes misinterpreted, and instead we get these two-dimensional superwomen who maybe have one quality that's played up a lot, like a Catwoman type, or she plays her sexuality up a lot, and it's seen as power.
But they're not strong characters who happen to be female.
They're completely flat, and they're basically cardboard characters.
The problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to understand, and women are mad at themselves for not being that simple, when, in actuality, women are complicated, women are multifaceted -- not because women are crazy, but because people are crazy, and women happen to be people.
So the flaws are the key.
I'm not the first person to say this.
What makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws, who is maybe not immediately likable, but eventually relatable.
I don't like to acknowledge a problem without also acknowledging those who work to fix it, so just wanted to acknowledge shows like "Mad Men," movies like "Bridesmaids," whose female characters or protagonists are complex, multifaceted.
Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO that premiers next month, "Girls," she said she wanted to start it because she felt that every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions, and that feels accurate for all people, but you don't see women represented like that as much.
Congrats, guys.
But I don't feel that — I still feel that there are some types of women who are not represented that way, and one group that we'll focus on today are teens, because I think teenagers are especially contradictory and still figuring it out, and in the '90s there was "Freaks and Geeks" and "My So-Called Life," and their characters, Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase, I mean, the whole premise of the shows were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically, but those shows only lasted a season each, and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since.
So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — — around the time when I was, when I started watching those TV shows.
I was ending middle school, starting high school -- I'm a sophomore now — and I was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you're told you can't be when you're growing up as a girl.
You can't be smart and pretty.
You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion.
You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake of what other people, usually men, will think of you.
So I was trying to figure all that out, and I felt a little confused, and I said so on my blog, and I said that I wanted to start a website for teenage girls that was not this kind of one-dimensional strong character empowerment thing because I think one thing that can be very alienating about a misconception of feminism is that girls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up to being perfectly consistent in your beliefs, never being insecure, never having doubts, having all of the answers. And this is not true, and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling became easier once I understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion, a conversation, a process, and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year when I -- I mean, I think I've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since.
But, yeah.
So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing, their photography, whatever, to be a member of our staff.
I got about 3,000 emails.
My editorial director and I went through them and put together a staff of people, and we launched last September.
And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter, where I say that Rookie, we don't have all the answers, we're still figuring it out too, but the point is not to give girls the answers, and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves, but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission, they can ask their own questions, find their own answers, all of that, and Rookie, I think we've been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out.
So I'm not saying, "Be like us," and "We're perfect role models," because we're not, but we just want to help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimensions.
I mean, we have articles called "On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You," but we also have articles like, oops -- I'm figuring it out!
Ha ha.
If you use that, you can get away with anything.
We also have articles called "How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes."
So all of that being said, I still really appreciate those characters in movies and articles like that on our site, that aren't just about being totally powerful, maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those.
So what I you to take away from my talk, the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.
Like, that's all you have to do.
Because my favorite thing about her, other than, like, everything, is that she is very -- has always been unapologetically present on stage, and unapologetic about her flaws and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings and she makes you listen to them and think about them, and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.
Thank you.

In 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia, and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel.
And as I looked into his eyes, I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners, that I would never have written a letter for him, because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody.
He was not a political prisoner.
He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle.
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia, but of the 113 developing countries that torture, 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured.
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool.
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst, but, in fact, 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners.
It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems, and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation -- it's cheaper than having a legal system, cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel -- it is what happens most of the time.
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community, if we make a decision, to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime, but it will require three things.
First is the training, empowerment, and connection of defenders worldwide.
The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel.
And the third is commitment.
So in the year 2000, I began to wonder, what if we came together?
Could we do something for these 93 countries?
And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms.
My first experiences, though, did come from Cambodia, and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were, in 1994, still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all.
And even 20 years later, there was only 10 lawyers in the country, so consequently you'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys, you'd meet women and you'd say, "Why are you here?" Women would say, "Well I've been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime, but they can't find him."
So it's just a place where there was no rule of law.
The first group of defenders came together and I still remember, as I was training, I said, "Okay, what do you do for an investigation?"
And there was silence in the class, and finally one woman stood up, [inaudible name], and she said "Khrew," which means "teacher."
She said, "I have defended more than a hundred people, and I've never had to do any investigation, because they all come with confessions."
And we talked about, as a class, the fact that number one, the confessions might not be reliable, but number two, we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this, especially as it was now against the law.
And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws.
And I still remember the first cases where they came, all 25 together, she would stand up, and they were in the back, and they would support her, and the judges kept saying, "No, no, no, no, we're going to do things the exact same way we've been doing them."
But one day the perfect case came, and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller, she was sitting outside of a house.
She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was, but the police came, they got her, there was nothing on her.
She was pregnant at the time. She had cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried.
And when they brought her case to the judge, for the first time he stood up and he said, "Yes, there's no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released."
And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see, they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia.
But Cambodia is not alone.
I used to think, well is it Cambodia?
Or is it other countries?
But it is in so many countries.
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't a 12-year-old boy, it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone.
Or a woman, I picked up her baby, really cute baby, I said "Your baby is so cute."
It wasn't a baby, she was three.
And she said "Yeah, but she's why I'm here," because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison.
And when I walked up to the prison director, I said, "You've got to let her out.
A judge would let her out."
And he said, "Okay, we can talk about it, but look at my prison. Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer. What can we do?"
So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases.
But we realized that it's not only the training of the lawyers, but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference.
For example, in Cambodia, it was that [inaudible name] did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together. And in the same way, in China, they always tell me, "It's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together."
Or in Zimbabwe, where I remember Innocent, after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said, "I've been here for one year, eight years, 12 years without a lawyer," he came and we had a training together and he said, "I have heard it said" -- because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling -- "I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources."
And then he said, "But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice."
And with that, he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases.
The key that we see, though, is training and then early access.
I was recently in Egypt, and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers, and what they told me is that they said, "Hey, look, we don't have police on the streets now. The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution. They were torturing everybody all the time."
And I said, "But there's been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here.
What's going on?"
I met with one of the development agencies, and they were training prosecutors and judges, which is the normal bias, as opposed to defenders.
And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual.
I said, "I'm gonna copy this."
It had everything in it. Lawyers can come at the police station. It was perfect.
Prosecutors were perfectly trained.
But I said to them, "I just have one question, which is, by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor's office, what had happened to them?"
And after a pause, they said, "They had been tortured."
So the pieces are, not only the training of the lawyers, but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel, because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured.
And as I tell you this, I'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like, "Oh, okay, it sounds like we could do it, but can we really do it?"
Because it sounds big.
And there are many reasons why I believe it's possible.
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment.
It's not only Innocent, who I told you about in Zimbabwe, but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces.
We have a program called JusticeMakers, and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things, but how can we support them?
So it's an online contest where it's only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice.
And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world, from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC, who with five thousand dollars do amazing things, through SMS programs, through paralegal programs, through whatever they can do.
And it's not only these JusticeMakers, but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward.
So in China, for instance, great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished.
And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers, and said, "How can we get this out? How can we make sure that this is implemented?
This is fantastic." And he said to me, "Well, do you have money?" And I said, "No." And he said, "That's okay, we can still figure it out."
And on December 4, he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League, from 14 of the top law schools, who organized themselves, developed posters with the new laws, and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights.
So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders.
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel.
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this.
And people often say to me, "You know, this is great, but it's wildly idealistic.
Never going to happen."
And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery, or end apartheid.
It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit.
Now, there's one of our favorite poems from the defenders, which they share from each other, is: "Take courage friends, the road is often long, the path is never clear, and the stakes are very high, but deep down, you are not alone."
And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders, but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it, we can end torture as an investigative tool.
I end always, because I'm sure the questions are -- and I'd be happy to talk to you at any point -- "But what can I really do?"
Well, I would say this. First of all, you know what you can do. But second of all, I would leave you with the story of Vishna, who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice.
Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province. But because he was born in the prison, everybody loved him, including the guards, so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars.
So, you know, there's bars. And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger, which means what gets bigger? Your head gets bigger.
So he would come to the first bar, the second bar and then the third bar, and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through, and come back, third, second, first. And he would grab my pinkie, because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit.
You know, he never quite made it to all of them every day, but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners. And I would lift him, and he would put his fingers through.
Or if they were dark cells, it was like iron corrugated, and he would put his fingers through.
And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine, and they looked forward to him. And I was like, here's Vishna. He's a 4-year-old boy.
He was born in a prison with almost nothing, no material goods, but he had a sense of his own heroic journey, which I believe we are all born into. He said, "Probably I can't do everything.
But I'm one. I can do something.
And I will do the one thing that I can do."
So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together, and invite you into this journey with us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

<title>Karen Tse: How to stop torture</title>
<description>Political prisoners aren't the only ones being tortured -- the vast majority of judicial torture happens in ordinary cases, even in 'functioning' legal systems. Social activist Karen Tse shows how we can, and should, stand up and end the use of routine torture.</description>

Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be.
And in my idea, heaven is satisfied curiosity.
I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where I can just lie down with my belly down, like I was watching TV when I was a child, and my elbows up.
And I can basically look everywhere I want, see every movie I've always wanted to see.
And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in New York when you're reading, there's something really soothing and easy.
Well, the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life, in a way, because I discovered ...
it took me a while to understand it, but when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable with objects than with people, I finally decided to really embrace this passion.
And I basically live my life in sort of a trance, and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story.
Just to give you an example: this is the exhibition, Humble Masterpieces, as it was at MoMA in 2004.
We were in Queens, we were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown, so we were in the small, small, small boondocks.
That was one of the funnest moments of my career.
But it's not only that.
The typeface -- the typeface is Helvetica; it's its 50th anniversary this year.
And so I start thinking -- Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together, trying to outdo Akzidenz-Grotesk, and come up with a new sans-serif typeface -- and the movie starts playing in my head already.
And of course, you can imagine, with Humble Masterpieces it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred.
And I do hope, by the way, that the real goal of the exhibition is going to have the same effect on you.
The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...
you know when they do homeworks at home?
Instead of having a tray with two peas, I was hoping that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag and do their museum-quality design collection on a tray.
So, everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces, and at MoMA we put out some books just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces.
And when you do that, usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions, and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions.
And a lot of nationalism came in.
For instance, I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop, but they were very proud so every Spaniard said "la frego." And Italians did the pizza.
And I wanted to show you, also, the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good -- they had moonshine, laundry detergents and liquid nails.
And I keep it going, and I just got, also, this suggestion from Milan: it's our traffic divider, which we call "panettone," and it's painted; it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan to define all the lanes of traffic.
So, think of your own, send them on if you want to -- they're always welcome.
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more what I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.
I'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal.
Different parts of the world have a knack for different things.
I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay, and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism that you don't see elsewhere, but the contemporary art was terrible.
In Italy, in Milan especially, contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place.
But design -- oh, my God.
What you find at the store at the corner, without going to any kind of fancy store, is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated.
It's just what you find at the store.
And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art.
I'm always amazed -- three-year-olds know who Richard Serra is and take you to the galleries.
But design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration.
It's really interesting: what many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of this kind of overdesigned -- in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but -- decoration, interior decoration.
They think of somebody choosing fabrics.
Design can be that, of course, but it can also be this.
It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people, because, as you know, Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies.
So, what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline, so that instead of being completely strangled, a teenager can also sip a Coke.
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important.
And then they make a little tent for the baby.
However cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design, and it is miles away from the fancy furniture, but still, it's part of my same field of passion.
What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to harness the power of MoMA because it's great to work there. You really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions, and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors.
I'm very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse, and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there.
But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929, which is to try and see what's going on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make things better.
There have been many episodes, and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience, but in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather -- I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly -- Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time were involved in two competitions: one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948 was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture.
And then there was good design for very low price.
There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life.
So, I started out in '95 with this exhibition that was called Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design.
It was about a new phase, in my opinion, in the world of design in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves.
And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California; at that time, they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market.
And at the same time, the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro, who did these beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough.
So you see, the range is really quite diverse.
And then, for instance, this other exhibition that was entitled Workspheres in 2001, where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time.
And you see IDEO there.
It was beautiful -- it was called Personal Skies.
The idea was that if you had a cubicle, you could project a sky on top of your head and have your own "Cielo in Una Stanza" -- a sky in a room -- it's a very famous Italian song.
And other examples: this was Marti Guixe about working on the go, and Hella Jongerius, my favorite, about how to work at home.
And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design: designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world.
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs, current conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues, and then what they do at the end -- if they are good -- is much more than the sum of its parts.
Hella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hilarious.
The idea behind her work was that at that time, everybody was saying you have to really divide your life.
Instead, she said, "No, no. Work and leisure can be together."
Yeah, that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the TV dinner of 2001.
There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime, but I don't want to focus on my shows.
I would like, instead, to talk about how great some designers are.
I've always had a hard time with the word "maverick."
I came to the United States 13 years ago, and to this day I have to ask, "What does that mean?"
So, this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle.
Therefore, he was not following everybody's lead, and therefore, he was a maverick.
So, designers do need to be mavericks, because the best way to design a successful object -- and also an object that we were missing before -- is to pretend that either it never existed or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it.
So, Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA and it ended at the beginning of last year.
It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection.
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.
And then when 9/11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition until, slowly but surely, it came back -- as a half-full glass instead of half-empty -- and it was about protection and safety.
But it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to these kind of water-sterilizing straws, so it was really wide-ranging.
It also had ... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together, and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition.
But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore; design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point.
It's a sense of economy and a sense, also, of humor.
This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland, who's South African.
It's a suit for civil disobedience.
The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest and the police comes towards you, you're wearing this thing -- it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart so your heartbeat is amplified -- and the police is reminded; it's like having a flower in front of the rifle.
And also, you can imagine, a whole group of people with the same suit will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police.
So, designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional, but they're functional to our understanding of issues.
Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia, like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away; or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States -- I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA; or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations.
But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self, and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic.
This is Cindy van den Bremen, who is a Dutch designer that's done this series of Capsters.
They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski, play tennis, do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves.
And sometimes by doing this kind of research, you encounter such beautiful ideas of design.
Twan Verdonck is really young, I think he's 27, and working together with some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial stimulation for children that have psychological impairments.
They're quite beautiful.
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight, so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self.
Design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges.
I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul.
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury, and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality.
And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury, and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much.
I want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy -- very, very clear limits.
This is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell, and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks.
So they're quite beautiful, but they're beautiful because they're so smart and economical.
And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo, Fernando and Humberto Campana, who got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money.
But that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself.
So really, design takes everything into account, and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances, as we become more and more wireless and impalpable, designers, instead, want us to be hands-on.
Sometimes hammer-on.
This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically.
Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint, all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona.
From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples to these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes.
It's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design.
Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna, whose name was Marchetti, explain how the innovation in the military industry -- therefore, secret innovation -- and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed.
And that makes sense.
In moments of war there's great technological innovation, and in the world you have to do without -- well, during the Second World War, you had to do without steel, you had to do without aluminum.
And then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden available for the civilian market.
Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance: fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden.
I think that this is a strange moment.
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously, just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years, so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is.
But it surely is a very important moment for design, because not only is the technology proceeding, not only is computing technology making open-source possible also in the world of design, but also the idea of sustainability -- which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint, but also sustainability of human interrelationships -- is very much part of the work of so many designers.
And that's why designers, more and more, are working on behaviors rather than on objects.
Especially the good ones, not all of them.
I wanted to show you, for instance, the work of Mathieu Lehanneur, which is quite fantastic.
He's another young designer from France who's working -- and at this point he's working, also, with pharmaceutical companies -- on new ways to engage patients, especially children, in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty.
For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine, so the child has to go -- pffff! -- to release and relieve the container itself.
And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin, so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind of delivery.
Similarly, there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste, orally.
The next show that I'm going to work on -- and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here -- is about the relationship between design and science.
I'm trying to find not the metaphors, but, rather, the points in common -- the common gripes, the common issues, the common preoccupations -- and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form.
And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.
I've sent an email already to quite a few of you.
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales, and therefore, really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful.
Thank you.

<title>Paola Antonelli: Treat design as art</title>
<description>Paola Antonelli, design curator at New York's Museum of Modern Art, wants to spread her appreciation of design -- in all shapes and forms -- around the world.</description>
<keywords>art,arts,culture,design,museums</keywords>

So what's image got do with it?
And I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages, because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up.
But I'm going to try and do something different, and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories, and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about.
So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions, as you can see.
We're not the only ones.
And you know, it's amazing.
I mean, we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.
Just think about that, you know?
And this is typically what we've been talking about, the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff.
Now, why is that a problem?
A typical disaster story: disease, corruption, poverty.
And some of you might be standing here thinking, saying, "OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated, and all you privileged people come here, saying, 'Forget the poor people.
Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' " And they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans who really need help."
And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK?
And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.
We start with poverty.
I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire, but I know what it is to grow up without having money, or being able to support family.
Euvin was talking about bellwether signs.
The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.
You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.
When things were bad, we had porridge.
And like many African families, my parents could never save because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents, and things were always dicey.
Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid, and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school, which was free.
And they adopted a very interesting approach to education, which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.
So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school, which set the foundation for what ended up being my career.
And what happened was, because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not, I got kicked out pretty much every term.
You know, someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees, and when they started getting pretty strict, you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.
And I remember thinking, I mean, why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?
Because you know, as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive, and everyone knows you guys don't have money.
But they kept at it, and I now understand why they did what they did.
They talk about corruption.
In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.
And there's national schools, which are like the best schools, and provincial schools.
My dream school at that time was Kenya High School, a national school.
I missed the cutoff by one point.
And I was so disappointed, and I was like, "Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?"
And my father said, "OK, listen.
Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress.
You know, it's just one point. I mean, maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there."
So we went to the school, and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege, and because my father didn't have the right last name, he was treated like dirt.
And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying, you know, who do you think you are?
And, you know, you must be joking if you think you can get a slot.
And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians, and who had done much, much worse than I did, and they had slots there.
And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you, you know?
And we left, and I swore to myself, to beg for anything in my life."
They called me two weeks later, they're like, oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.
Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.
Disease.
My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.
He never told anyone that he had AIDS, his fear of the stigma was so strong.
And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.
And I was in the States at the time, and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.
And he had Cryptococcal meningitis.
And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.
Because of doctor-patient privilege, they couldn't really tell us what was going on.
But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.
And when I went online and looked at the infectious -- read about the disease, I pretty much realized what was going on.
The first time he got sick, he recovered.
But what happened was that he had to be on medication that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.
He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.
You know, so money ran out.
He got sick again.
And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India, and he used to import, bring him, could get him a generic version of it.
And that kept him going.
But the money ran out.
He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.
At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya, and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday.
The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.
And finally, we figured, well, OK, we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.
At least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation.
And he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him.
And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me.
How would you look at me?
With pity, you know. Sadness.
And this is how you look at Africa.
This is the damage it causes.
You don't see the other side of me.
You don't see the blogger, you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer, the vibrant person, you know?
And I just wanted to personalize that.
Because we talk about it in big terms, and you wonder, you know, so what?
But it's damaging.
And I'm not unique, right?
Imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village.
And you didn't know about the windmill, you know?
And I was just moved.
I was actually crying during his presentation.
He was like, I try and I make.
I was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!"
And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.
When you focus just on the disasters -- -- we're ignoring the potential.
So, what is to be done?
First of all, Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories.
We heard about that yesterday.
We had some of them this morning.
blogging is one way of doing that.
Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs that was developed in South Africa.
So we need to start getting better.
If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.
And going back to the point I was trying to make, this is the Swahili Wikipedia.
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.
It only has five contributors.
Four of them are white males -- non-native speakers.
The other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up -- is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.
He's the only African who's contributing to this.
People, please. We can't whine and complain the West is doing this.
What are we doing?
Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers?
Why are we not generating our own content?
You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.
Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa.
So, that's a start, and we've heard of all their other initiatives.
The cheetah generation.
The aid approach, you know, is flawed.
And after all the hoopla of Live 8, we're still not anywhere in the picture.
No, you're not.
But the point I'm trying to make, though, is that it's not enough for us to criticize.
And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be, should I move back, should I stay?
You know, just jump.
The continent needs you.
And I can't emphasize that enough, you know.
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C., Covington and Burling, six figures.
With two paychecks, or three paychecks, I could solve a lot of my family's problems.
But I walked away from that, because my passion was here, and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.
And because I'm needed here, you know?
I probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I'm doing.
One is because I'm pretty aggressive, and I try and find, you know, opportunities.
But there is such a need, you know?
I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.
We're now moving into East Africa.
And we give them business development services, as well as financing loan and equity.
I've also set up a project in Kenya, and what we do is we track the performance of Kenyan MPs.
My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.
It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.
Everything else on there is a labor of love.
We've manually entered all the data there.
And you can get profiles of each MP, questions they've asked in parliament.
We have a comment function, where people can ask their MPs questions.
There are some MPs who participate, and come back and ask.
And basically, we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians.
You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.
You're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart.
And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.
What are they doing?
You know, they're not going to change just out of nowhere.
So we need new policies, we need -- where's that coming from, you know?
Another thing is that these leaders We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars, you know?
They come from us.
And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?
And how can we change that?
So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.
Where do we go from here?
I believe in the power of ideas.
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge.
And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share, and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going, because it can make a difference.
The other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual.
I've had lots of conversations about things I think need to be happening in Africa.
People are like, "OK, if you don't do aid, I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?"
And when I talk about my ideas, they're like, "BBut it's not scalable, you know.
Give me something I can do with Paypal."
It's not that easy, you know?
And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual, in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met, it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa, because usually the individual in Africa carries a lot of people behind them.
Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school, my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad.
I was helping her pay her tuition.
My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.
I was paying her school fees.
A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan, so we said, well, what are we going to do with her?
You know, she's now my baby sister.
And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me, I am able to lift all those people.
So, don't underestimate that.
An example. This man changed my life.
He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt.
He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.
And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School, because he took an interest.
I was taking a class of his, and he was just like, this is an overeager student, which we don't normally get in the United States, because everyone else is cynical and jaded.
He called me to his office and said, "What do you want to do when you grow up?"
I said, "I want to be a lawyer."
And he was like, "Why? You know, we don't need another lawyer in the United States."
And he tried to talk me out of it, but it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school, I'm poli-sci Ph.D.
But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do, what I need to do to help you out."
It was like, "Where do you want to go?"
And to me at that time university -- I was at University of Pitts for undergrad, and that was like heaven, OK, because compared to what could have been in Kenya.
So I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school."
He was like, "Why? You know, you're smart, you have all these things going for you."
And I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap, and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh."
Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard for applying to law school.
And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.
And he said, "Look, you can get into Harvard, you're that good, OK?
And if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up."
And he built me up, you know?
And this is just an illustration.
You can meet other individuals here.
We just need a push.
That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.
Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?
A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential.
You know, my vision is that my daughter, and any other African child being born today, can be whoever they want to be here, without having to leave.
And they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born.
That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?
That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances, and you can move.
Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever, that doesn't define who you are.
For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born, and the circumstances under which you were born, determine the rest of your life.
I would like to see that change, and the change starts with us.
And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.
Thank you.

I'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk.
I woke up the morning after I gave that Talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life.
And I actually didn't leave my house for about three days.
The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch.
And when I walked in, she was already at the table.
And I sat down, and she said, "God, you look like hell."
I said, "Thanks. I feel really -- I'm not functioning."
And she said, "What's going on?"
And I said, "I just told 500 people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability.
And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data, as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living, I told these 500 people that I had a breakdown.
I had a slide that said Breakdown.
At what point did I think that was a good idea?"
And she said, "I saw your Talk live-streamed.
It was not really you.
It was a little different than what you usually do.
But it was great."
And I said, "This can't happen.
YouTube, they're putting this thing on YouTube.
And we're going to be talking about 600, 700 people."
And she said, "Well, I think it's too late."
And I said, "Let me ask you something."
And she said, "Yeah."
And I said, "Do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb?"
And she said, "Yeah."
And I said, "Remember when we'd leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine?
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape?"
And she goes, "Uh ... no."
So of course, the only thing I could think of to say at that point was, "Yeah, me neither.
That ... me neither."
And I'm thinking to myself, "Brene, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Why did you bring this up? Have you lost your mind?
Your sisters would be perfect for this."
So I looked back up and she said, "Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube?"
And I said, "I'm just thinking about it a little bit."
She said, "You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever."
And then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic, but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic.
I said, "If 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000, my life is over."
I had no contingency plan for four million.
And my life did end when that happened.
And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself, and that was that, as much as I would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world, there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small, staying right under the radar.
But I want to talk about what I've learned.
There's two things that I've learned in the last year.
The first is vulnerability is not weakness.
And that myth is profoundly dangerous.
Let me ask you honestly -- and I'll give you this warning, I'm trained as a therapist, so I can out-wait you uncomfortably -- so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome -- how many of you honestly, when you're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable, think, "God, vulnerability's weakness. This is weakness?"
How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously?
The majority of people.
Now let me ask you this question: This past week at TED, how many of you, when you saw vulnerability up here, thought it was pure courage?
Vulnerability is not weakness.
I define vulnerability as emotional risk, exposure, uncertainty.
It fuels our daily lives.
And I've come to the belief -- this is my 12th year doing this research -- that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage -- to be vulnerable, to let ourselves be seen, to be honest.
One of the weird things that's happened is, after the TED explosion, I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country -- everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune 500 companies.
And so many of the calls went like this, "Hey, Dr. Brown. We loved your TEDTalk.
We'd like you to come in and speak.
We'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame."
What would you like for me to talk about?
There's three big answers.
This is mostly, to be honest with you, from the business sector: innovation, creativity and change.
So let me go on the record and say, vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change.
To create is to make something that has never existed before.
There's nothing more vulnerable than that.
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability.
The second thing, in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage, the second thing I learned is this: We have to talk about shame.
And I'm going to be really honest with you.
When I became a "vulnerability researcher" and that became the focus because of the TEDTalk -- and I'm not kidding.
I'll give you an example.
About three months ago, I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store.
About from a hundred feet away, this is what I hear: "Vulnerability TED! Vulnerability TED!"
I'm a fifth generation Texan.
Our family motto is "Lock and load."
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher.
So I'm like, just keep walking, she's on my six.
And then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"
I turn around, I go, "Hi."
She's right here and she said, "You're the shame researcher who had the breakdown."
At this point parents are, like, pulling their children close.
"Look away."
And I'm so worn out at this point in my life, I look at her and I actually say, "It was a frickin' spiritual awakening."
And she looks back and does this, "I know."
And she said, "We watched your TEDTalk in my book club.
Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves 'The Breakdown Babes.'" And she said, "Our tagline is: 'We're falling apart and it feels fantastic.'" You can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting.
So when I became Vulnerability TED, like an action figure -- like Ninja Barbie, but I'm Vulnerability TED -- I thought, I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind, because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability.
And I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic, no one wants to talk about it.
It's the best way to shut people down on an airplane.
"What do you do?" "I study shame." "Oh."
And I see you.
But in surviving this last year, I was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule, but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- you've got to dance with the one who brung ya.
And I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability.
I learned about these things from studying shame.
And so I want to walk you in to shame.
Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul.
And we're going to walk in.
And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there.
It is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around.
Here's why.
We heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country, and I think globally, around race, right?
Yes? We heard that.
Yes?
Cannot have that conversation without shame, because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege.
And when people start talking about privilege, they get paralyzed by shame.
We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery, which is have a checklist.
You can't fix that problem without addressing shame, because when they teach those folks how to suture, they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful.
And all-powerful folks don't need checklists.
And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didn't mess it up here.
Myshkin Ingawale, I hope I did right by you.
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.
And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying unnecessarily.
And he said, "I saw this need.
So you know what I did? I made it."
And everybody just burst into applause, and they were like "Yes!"
And he said, "And it didn't work.
And then I made it 32 more times, and then it worked."
You know what the big secret about TED is?
I can't wait to tell people this.
I guess I'm doing it right now.
This is like the failure conference.
No, it is.
You know why this place is amazing?
Because very few people here are afraid to fail.
And no one who gets on the stage, so far that I've seen, has not failed.
I've failed miserably, many times.
I don't think the world understands that because of shame.
There's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt.
A lot of people refer to it as the "Man in the Arena" quote.
And it goes like this: "It is not the critic who counts.
It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles.
The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat.
But when he's in the arena, at best he wins, and at worst he loses, but when he fails, when he loses, he does so daring greatly."
And that's what this conference, to me, is about.
That's what life is about, about daring greatly, about being in the arena.
When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door, and you think, "I'm going in and I'm going to try this," shame is the gremlin who says, "Uh, uh.
You're not good enough.
You never finished that MBA. Your wife left you.
I know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg, he was in Sing Sing.
I know those things that happened to you growing up.
I know you don't think that you're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough.
I know your dad never paid attention, even when you made CFO."
Shame is that thing.
And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say, "I'm going to do this," we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing, 99 percent of the time is who?
Us.
Shame drives two big tapes -- "never good enough" and, if you can talk it out of that one, "who do you think you are?"
The thing to understand about shame is it's not guilt.
Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.
Shame is "I am bad."
Guilt is "I did something bad."
How many of you, if you did something that was hurtful to me, would be willing to say, "I'm sorry. I made a mistake?"
How many of you would be willing to say that?
Guilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
Shame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.
There's a huge difference between shame and guilt.
And here's what you need to know.
Shame is highly, highly correlated with addiction, depression, violence, aggression, bullying, suicide, eating disorders.
And here's what you even need to know more.
Guilt, inversely correlated with those things.
The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive.
It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.
The other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender.
If shame washes over me and washes over Chris, it's going to feel the same.
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame.
We're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy.
Which means, yes, I have a little shame; no, I'm a sociopath.
So I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame.
Shame feels the same for men and women, but it's organized by gender.
For women, the best example I can give you is Enjoli the commercial: "I can put the wash on the line, pack the lunches, hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine.
I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man."
For women, shame is do it all, do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat.
I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold, but I guarantee you, it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds.
Shame, for women, is this web of unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations about who we're supposed to be.
And it's a straight-jacket.
For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations.
Shame is one, do not be perceived as what?
Weak.
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study.
And it wasn't until a man looked at me one day after a book signing, said, "I love what you have to say about shame, I'm curious why you didn't mention men."
And I said, "I don't study men."
And he said, "That's convenient."
And I said, "Why?"
And he said, "Because you say to reach out, tell our story, be vulnerable.
But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters?"
I said, "Yeah."
"They'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down.
When we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us.
And don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads, because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else."
So I started interviewing men and asking questions.
And what I learned is this: You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear, I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work.
You show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it, she can't do it all anymore, and his first response is not, "I unloaded the dishwasher," but he really listens -- because that's all we need -- I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work.
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.
And to get out from underneath it, to find our way back to each other, we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting, the way we're working, the way we're looking at each other.
Very quickly, some research by Mahalik at Boston College.
He asked, what do women need to do to conform to female norms?
The top answers in this country: nice, thin, modest and use all available resources for appearance.
When he asked about men, what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms, the answers were: always show emotional control, work is first, pursue status and violence.
If we're going to find our way back to each other, we have to understand and know empathy, because empathy's the antidote to shame.
If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment.
If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy, it can't survive.
The two most powerful words when we're in struggle: me too.
And so I'll leave you with this thought.
If we're going to find our way back to each other, vulnerability is going to be that path.
And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena, because I think I did it my whole life, and think to myself, I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.
And that is seductive.
But the truth is that never happens.
And even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there, that's not what we want to see.
We want you to go in.
We want to be with you and across from you.
And we just want, for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with, to dare greatly.
So thank you all very much. I really appreciate it.

It's wonderful to be here to talk about my journey, to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought me.
I started using a wheelchair 16 years ago when an extended illness changed the way I could access the world.
When I started using the wheelchair, it was a tremendous new freedom.
I'd seen my life slip away and become restricted.
It was like having an enormous new toy.
I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again.
Just being out on the street was exhilarating.
But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom, people's reaction completely changed towards me.
It was as if they couldn't see me anymore, as if an invisibility cloak had descended.
They seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair.
When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair, they used words like "limitation," "fear," "pity" and "restriction."
I realized I'd internalized these responses and it had changed who I was on a core level.
A part of me had become alienated from myself.
I was seeing myself not from my perspective, but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people's responses to me.
As a result, I knew I needed to make my own stories about this experience, new narratives to reclaim my identity.
["Finding Freedom: 'By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do 'official' narratives.' — Davis 2009, TEDx Women"] I started making work that aimed to communicate something of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair -- a power chair -- to negotiate the world.
I was working to transform these internalized responses, to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped my identity when I started using a wheelchair, by creating unexpected images.
The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with.
When I literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom, it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people.
It seemed to open up new perspectives, and therein lay the paradigm shift.
It showed that an arts practice can remake one's identity and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar.
So when I began to dive, in 2005, I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does, but the associations attached to scuba gear are ones of excitement and adventure, completely different to people's responses to the wheelchair.
So I thought, "I wonder what'll happen if I put the two together?"
And the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years.
So to give you an idea of what that's like, I'd like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle, and show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on.
It is the most amazing experience, beyond most other things I've experienced in life.
I literally have the freedom to move in 360 degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom.
And the incredibly unexpected thing is that other people seem to see and feel that too.
Their eyes literally light up, and they say things like, "I want one of those," or, "If you can do that, I can do anything."
And I'm thinking, it's because in that moment of them seeing an object they have no frame of reference for, or so transcends the frames of reference they have with the wheelchair, they have to think in a completely new way.
And I think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people's lives.
For me, this means that they're seeing the value of difference, the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation, we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives.
For me, the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation.
In fact, I now call the underwater wheelchair "Portal," because it's literally pushed me through into a new way of being, into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness.
And the other thing is, that because nobody's seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before, and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing, being and knowing, now you have this concept in your mind.
You're all part of the artwork too.

I just did something I've never done before.
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel.
Now I'm not a scientist, but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil in the Gulf of Mexico.
This is the boat we were on, by the way.
The scientists I was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff -- the birds, the turtles, the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.
They're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.
And what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton, which is very bad news, because so much life depends on it.
So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it, this disaster is still unfolding.
It's still working its way up the food chain.
Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us.
Rachel Carson -- the godmother of modern environmentalism -- warned us about this very thing back in 1962.
She pointed out that the "control men" -- as she called them -- who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like DDT, were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects, not the birds.
But they forgot this: the fact that birds dine on grubs, that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with DDT.
And so, robin eggs failed to hatch, songbirds died en masse, towns fell silent.
Thus the title "Silent Spring."
I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico, because I'm Canadian, and I can draw no ancestral ties.
And I think what it is is I don't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster, with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world, with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth gush forth on live TV, 24 hours a day, for months.
After telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature, suddenly we were face-to-face with our weakness, with our lack of control, as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it -- "top hats," "top kills" and, most memorably, the "junk shot" -- the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world.
But even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed -- the carelessness, the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean-up.
If there is one thing BP's watery improv act made clear, it is that, as a culture, we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable, and to do so without a back-up plan, without an exit strategy.
And BP was hardly our first experience of this in recent years.
Our leaders barrel into wars, telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades.
Then, it is years of deadly damage control, Frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter-insurgencies, and once again, no exit strategy.
Our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence, convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market -- the kind that never goes down.
And when it inevitably does, the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot -- in this case, throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole.
As with BP, the hole does get plugged, at least temporarily, but not before exacting a tremendous price.
We have to figure out why we keep letting this happen, because we are in the midst of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all -- deciding what to do, or not to do, about climate change.
Now as you know, a great deal of time is spent, in this country and around the world, inside the climate debate, on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists are all wrong?"
Now a far more relevant question -- as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it -- is, "What if those scientists are right?"
Given the stakes, the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle -- the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible, we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty.
Better to err on the side of caution.
More overt, the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed, but rather on the industry that stands to profit.
But climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution, but rather on cost-benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our GDP.
So rather than asking, as precaution would demand, what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe, we ask bizarre questions like this: "What is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions?
Can we put this off till 2020, 2030, 2050?"
Or we ask, "How much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive?
Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or -- where we're currently going -- four degrees Celsius?"
And by the way, the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat, making the planet not too hot, not too cold, but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy, and it's not coming from the climate scientists.
It's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science.
The fact is that we simply don't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops.
So once again, why do we take these crazy risks with the precious?
A range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now, like "greed."
This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it, because taking big risks, as we all know, pays a lot of money.
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris.
And greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness.
For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker taking home 100 times more than a brain surgeon, then you need a narrative, you need a story that makes that disparity okay.
And you actually don't have a lot of options.
You're either an incredibly good scammer, and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system -- or you're some kind of boy genius, the likes of which the world has never seen.
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future.
By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP, had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan: "What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?"
Now this is actually a popular plaque, and this is a crowd of overachievers, so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.
Don't feel ashamed.
Putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a TEDTalk, but personally, I think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall, because -- maybe not that one in particular -- but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time.
So we have greed, we've got overconfidence/hubris, but since we're here at TEDWomen, let's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness.
Now I'm not going to belabor this point, but studies do show that, as investors, women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men, precisely because, as we've already heard, women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do.
So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides -- for society at least.
The flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted, chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides.
And this problem -- call it the "perils of privilege" -- brings us closer, I think, to the root of our collective recklessness.
Because none of us -- at least in the global North -- neither men nor women, are fully exempt from this message.
Here's what I'm talking about.
Whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them, our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature -- the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer, the narrative of manifest destiny, the narrative of apocalypse and salvation.
And just when you think these stories are fading into history, and that we've gotten over them, they pop up in the strangest places.
For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the Kansas City airport.
It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone, and yes, it really does say, "Slap Mother Nature in the face."
And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola -- that's just a bonus.
I'm showing it because -- they're not a sponsor, are they? -- because, in its own way, this is a crass version of our founding story.
We slapped Mother Nature around and won, and we always win, because dominating nature is our destiny.
But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.
There's another one, equally important, about how that very same Mother Nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance.
Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.
"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.
The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume."
In other words, the ocean is big; she can take it.
It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do.
Because this is our real master-narrative: however much we mess up, there will always be more -- more water, more land, more untapped resources.
A new bubble will replace the old one.
A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one.
In a way, that is the story of the settling of the Americas, the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped.
And it's also the story of modern capitalism, because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system, one that cannot survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers.
Now the problem is that the story was always a lie.
The Earth always did have limits.
They were just beyond our sights.
And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts.
I believe that we know this, yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.
Not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories, but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that, frankly, verges on camp.
How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin?
Now on the one hand, exhorting us to "drill, baby, drill," because God put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them, and on the other, glorying in the wilderness of Alaska's untouched beauty on her hit reality TV show.
The twin message is as comforting as it is mad.
Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall.
There are still no limits.
There will always be another frontier.
So stop worrying and keep shopping.
Now, would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show.
In environmental circles, we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables, we are continuing with business as usual.
This assessment, unfortunately, is far too optimistic.
The truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era, the era of extreme energy.
So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water, including the icy Arctic seas, where a clean-up may simply be impossible.
It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal, the likes of which we haven't yet seen.
And most controversially, it means the tar sands.
I'm always surprised by how little people outside of Canada know about the Alberta Tar Sands, which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the United States.
It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice, because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else.
So this is where the tar sands live, under one of the last magnificent Boreal forests.
The oil is not liquid.
You can't just drill a hole and pump it out.
Tar sand's oil is solid, mixed in with the soil.
So to get at it, you first have to get rid of the trees.
Then, you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand.
The process requires a huge amount of water, which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.
That's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.
Now looking at these images, it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation, which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England.
I find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth, the largest ever built.
That's a person down there by the wheel.
My point is that this is not oil drilling.
It's not even mining.
It is terrestrial skinning.
Vast, vivid landscapes are being gutted, left monochromatic gray.
Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon.
But the truth is that, on average, turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in Canada.
How else to describe this, but as a form of mass insanity?
Just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet, off the power of sun, wind and waves, we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest, highest-emitting stuff imaginable.
This is where our story of endless growth has taken us, to this black hole at the center of my country -- a place of such planetary pain that, like the BP gusher, one can only stand to look at it for so long.
As Jared Diamond and others have shown us, this is how civilizations commit suicide, by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes.
The problem is that our master-narrative has an answer for that too.
At the very last minute, we are going to get saved just like in every Hollywood movie, just like in the Rapture.
But, of course, our secular religion is technology.
Now, you may have noticed more and more headlines like these.
The idea behind this form of "geoengineering" as it's called, is that, as the planet heats up, we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun's rays back to space, thereby cooling the planet.
The wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up -- would put what is essentially a garden hose 18-and-a-half miles high into the sky, suspended by balloons, to spew sulfur dioxide.
So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot.
The serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are entirely untested.
They don't know if they'll work, and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.
Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles, particularly media circles, with a relief tinged with euphoria.
An escape hatch has been reached.
A new frontier has been found.
Most importantly, we don't have to change our lifestyles after all.
You see, for some people, their savior is a guy in a flowing robe.
For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.
We badly need some new stories.
We need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks -- risks that confront recklessness head on, that put the precautionary principle into practice, even if that means through direct action -- like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested, blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.
We need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around.
That this is our only home.
There is no escape hatch.
Call it karma, call it physics, action and reaction, call it precaution -- the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit.
Thank you.

<title>Naomi Klein: Addicted to risk</title>
<description>Days before this talk, journalist Naomi Klein was on a boat in the Gulf of Mexico, looking at the catastrophic results of BP's risky pursuit of oil. Our societies have become addicted to extreme risk in finding new energy, new financial instruments and more ... and too often, we're left to clean up a mess afterward. Klein's question: What's the backup plan?</description>

Good afternoon, good evening, whatever.
We can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir, but we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
That is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening.
You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other, from one group of nests to the next.
And I want to pick up with my talk this evening from where Zeray left off yesterday.
He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam.
And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind through DNA genetic profiling.
And it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey, who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees.
And it was pretty extraordinary, way back then.
It's kind of commonplace now, but his argument was -- because he'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.
And you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils, from the shape of the muscle attachments, something about the way they lived from the various artifacts found with them.
But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know.
And of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.
He argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory -- that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today, then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like, human-like ancestor some seven million years ago.
And therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient, ancient past.
Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution, you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.
They are more like us than any other living creature, and we've heard about that during this TED Conference.
So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.
Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality.
Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more, although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.
Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.
Thereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years, a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing, sleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.
And we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.
As the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals, so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual's life history.
And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.
We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.
And we believe that it's in this way that the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa -- how these are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice, so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.
Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.
They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures, many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.
They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.
And they swagger and they throw rocks.
In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion, precursors to love and true altruism.
Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.
They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.
And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part, are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.
They are very territorially aggressive.
Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature, have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.
It's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations.
The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.
And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild, have helped -- more than anything else -- to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from, the amazing animals with whom we share the planet.
So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees, like so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.
This is just one photograph from the air, and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.
And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago, and realized that outside the park, this forest, which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies, that a question came to my mind.
"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees, when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?"
More people are living there than the land could possibly support.
The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi and over the lake from Congo.
And very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.
This led to a program, which we call TACARE.
It's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park.
It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.
There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries, methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded, almost desert-like land up in these mountains.
Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion.
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland, so that within two years they can again be productive.
Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.
Perhaps build some schoolrooms.
Most important of all, I believe, is working with small groups of women, providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.
And we've got, as is the case around the world, about 95 percent of all loans returned.
Empowering women, working with education, providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school, in the clear understanding that, all around the world, as women's education improves, family size drops.
We provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.
something's happening for conservation.
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages, instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian -- but when we began the TACARE program, it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.
It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers, asking what they were interested in.
Were they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.
They were interested in health; they were interested in education.
And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve, they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.
They began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees, so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.
Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.
This is an area way outside the National Park, stretching out into all these very degraded lands.
And as these villages have a better standard of life, they are actually agreeing to put between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside, so that once again, as the trees grow back, the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors through which they can travel to interact -- as they must for genetic viability -- with other remnant groups outside the National Park.
So TACARE is a success.
We're replicating it in other parts of Africa, around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure.
The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of TED, are major problems.
There is a great deal of poverty.
And when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile, particularly when you cut down trees, and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion, as desperate populations cut down more and more trees, so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families, what's going to happen? Something's got to give.
And the other problems -- in not only Africa, but the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere -- what are we doing to our planet?
You know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average European or American, we need three new planets.
Today, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.
And what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are, arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth, with this extraordinary brain, capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences, and yet we're destroying the only home we have.
The indigenous people around the world, before they made a major decision, used to sit around and ask themselves, "How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?"
Today, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here, but the developed world -- major decisions involving millions of dollars, and millions of people, are often based on, "How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?"
And these decisions affect Africa.
As I began traveling around Africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests, I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.
So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe, talking in the United States, going to Asia.
And everywhere there were these terrible problems.
And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.
The air that we breathe that often poisons us.
The earth is poisoning our foods.
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural, industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world, seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.
The mangroves are being cut down; the effects of things like the tsunami get worse.
We've talked about the soil erosion.
We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses, so called, leading to climate change.
Finally, all around the world, people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate.
All around the world climates are mixed up.
And it's the poor people who are affected worse.
It's Africa that already is affected.
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.
And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.
And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support, who are too poor to buy food, who can't move away because the whole land is degraded.
And so you get desertification -- creeping, creeping, creeping -- as the last of the trees are cut down.
And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.
So it wasn't surprising to me that as I was traveling around the world I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.
We seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.
I asked a question. "Why?"
Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain, the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify, and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term, in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?
And these young people, when I talk to them, basically they were either depressed or apathetic, or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing, "We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future and there's nothing we can do about it."
We have compromised their future.
I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age, I feel this desperation.
And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots, which began right here in Tanzania and has now spread to 97 countries around the world.
It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.
Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.
See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet, environmental and social. It's a message of hope.
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things.
The most important message of Roots and Shoots: every single one of us makes a difference, every single day.
We have a choice. Every one of us in this room, we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.
The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well.
The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.
It depends on how old they are, and which country, whether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.
But basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university, with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.
And every group chooses, between them, three different kinds of project to make this a better world, recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other.
So one of their projects will be to help their own human community.
And then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world.
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife, domestic animals as well.
And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.
And woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves, in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures, between religions and between us and the natural world.
We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.
We not do have more than this one planet.
Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing, one or two projects only -- in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon and other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.
Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.
They're working in the refugee camps, with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money, or just using them to feed their families, and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment, because they're no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens.
It's being used in Uganda to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.
Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.
Once again, they're useful members of society.
We have this program in prisons as well.
So, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.
But -- oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.
That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots, with older kids talking to younger ones.
And unwanted pregnancies and things like that, which young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.
Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world: "Jane, you've seen so many terrible things, you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million, at the turn of the century, to no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.
Forests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.
Do you really have hope?" Well, yes.
You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?
And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.
And I mean, think of the technologies.
And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.
It's one of my hobbyhorses.
We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.
And then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important.
Do we care about the planet for our children?
How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?
Do we care about their future?
And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world, we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.
What we buy. What we wear.
And choose to make these choices with the question, how will this affect the environment around me?
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?
Or my grandchild, or whatever it is.
So the human brain, coupled with the human heart, and we join hands around the world.
And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us, and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.
All of these technologies we can use.
Now let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?
You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.
This change, this change. To see change that we must have if we care about the future.
And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.
You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed, with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.
And an example is the TACARE program.
I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump -- if you stop hacking them for firewood, which you don't need to because you have wood lots, then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.
And animals, almost on the brink of extinction, can be given a second chance. That's my next book.
It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope, and we've heard about this so much in the last two days: this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people, the resilience of the human spirit, So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty, or disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it, sometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society, and take their part in changing the world.
And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring.
We could make a very long list, but obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years of hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment, with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.
Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies, and although people around the world tried their best, was executed.
People like this are so inspirational.
People like this are the role models we need for young Africans.
And we need some environmental role models as well, and I've been hearing some of them today.
So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again, with everyone at TED.
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things, especially the Roots and Shoots program.
And just a last word on that -- the young woman who's running this entire conference center, I met her today.
She came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots.
She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam.
She said it's helped her to do what she's doing.
And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people, when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action, to make the world a better place, truly are our hope for tomorrow.
Thank you.

I'm a visual artist, and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
I've been working with plastic bags, which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last 20 years.
I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations.
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years, some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.
And I thought, "Great.
It's ephemeral just like us."
Upon educating myself a little further about plastics, I actually realized this was a bad thing.
It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits, because it's always still plastic.
And what we're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment.
I then, in the last few years, learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre.
And my initial reaction -- and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction to learning about it -- is, "Oh my God!
We've got to go out there and clean this thing up."
So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers, a crane, a chipping machine and a cold-molding machine.
And my intention was to go out to the gyre, raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic, chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities.
I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so, I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world, and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.
And the bigger picture is: we need to find a way to turn off the faucet.
We need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics, which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale.
So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.
I wasn't just concerned about plastic that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean -- of which I have learned there are now 11 gyres, potentially, of plastic in five major oceans in the world.
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about -- it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket.
I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.
All of my beverages are packaged in plastic, even at the health food market.
I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator, and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies.
So I came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue, and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
We have many initiatives that we're working on, but some of them are very basic.
One is: if 80 to 90 percent of what we're finding in the ocean -- of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic, then why don't we call it what it is.
It's plastic pollution.
Recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.
What is the reality of that?
In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.
And if you really look into it, particularly when it comes to plastic bottles, most of it is only down-cycled, or incinerated, or shipped to China.
It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things, while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again -- a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.
So this is a big issue for us.
Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about is we've added a fourth R onto the front of the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," three R's, and that is refuse.
Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.
Alternatives exist; some of them are very old-school.
I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers to store food in.
And I know that I am doing a service to myself and my family.
It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle or a glass bottle, if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water, versus purchasing plastic bottled water.
I guess what I want to say to everybody here -- and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue -- is that this is a huge problem in the oceans, but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve.
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives.
So whenever possible, to choose alternatives to single-use plastics.
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so, save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.
Thank you.

I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense -- a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across.
And some of you may argue, well, don't today's cell phones do that already?
But I would say no.
When you meet someone here at TED -- and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year -- you don't shake somebody's hand and then say, "Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you?"
Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers, you don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser, and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make.
So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take.
And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way, without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior.
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort, and most successful effort so far, which is still very much a work in process.
I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time.
I'm wearing a camera, just a simple webcam, a portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror.
These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device.
And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry, who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system.
And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him.
The system tracks the four significant fingers.
In this case, he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize.
But if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors.
And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach, zoom in and out, etc.
The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the "take a picture" gesture, and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you.
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab, he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken, sort through them and organize them, and re-size them, etc., again using all natural gestures.
So, some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han or some of you may think, "Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?"
And yes, you also interact using natural gestures, both hands, etc.
But the difference here is that you can use any surface, you can walk to up to any surface, including your hand if nothing else is available and interact with this projected data.
The device is completely portable, and can be ...
So one important difference is that it's totally mobile.
Another even more important difference is that in mass production this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck.
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report," the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you.
So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels.
And, as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that he's picking up, using either image recognition or marker technology, and give him the green light or an orange light.
He can ask for additional information.
So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria.
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically-responsible choice.
If he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book.
This is Juan's book, our previous speaker, which gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon.
And so, Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book -- reader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc.
If he turns to a particular page he finds an annotation by maybe an expert of a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page.
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated.
You can get video annotations of the event that you're reading about You can get the latest sports scores etc.
This is a more controversial one.
As you interact with someone at TED, maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages.
In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.
On your way to the airport, if you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed, that the gate has changed, etc.
And, if you need to know what the current time is it's as simple as drawing a watch -- on your arm.
So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across.
My student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this.
He does deserve a lot of applause because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months, actually.
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either.
But it's not perfect yet, it's very much a work in progress.
And who knows, maybe in another 10 years we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant.
Thank you.

Let's face it: Driving is dangerous.
It's one of the things that we don't like to think about, but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true.
Car accidents are the leading cause of death in people ages 16 to 19 in the United States -- leading cause of death -- and 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol.
So what happens?
No one can say for sure, but I remember my first accident.
I was a young driver out on the highway, and the car in front of me, I saw the brake lights go on.
I'm like, "Okay, all right, this guy is slowing down, I'll slow down too."
I step on the brake.
But no, this guy isn't slowing down.
This guy is stopping, dead stop, dead stop on the highway.
It was just going 65 -- to zero?
I slammed on the brakes.
I felt the ABS kick in, and the car is still going, and it's not going to stop, and I know it's not going to stop, and the air bag deploys, the car is totaled, and fortunately, no one was hurt.
But I had no idea that car was stopping, and I think we can do a lot better than that.
I think we can transform the driving experience by letting our cars talk to each other.
I just want you to think a little bit about what the experience of driving is like now.
Get into your car. Close the door. You're in a glass bubble.
You can't really directly sense the world around you.
You're in this extended body.
You're tasked with navigating it down partially-seen roadways, in and amongst other metal giants, at super-human speeds.
Okay? And all you have to guide you are your two eyes.
Okay, so that's all you have, eyes that weren't really designed for this task, but then people ask you to do things like, you want to make a lane change, what's the first thing they ask you do?
Take your eyes off the road. That's right.
Stop looking where you're going, turn, check your blind spot, and drive down the road without looking where you're going.
You and everyone else. This is the safe way to drive.
Why do we do this? Because we have to, we have to make a choice, do I look here or do I look here?
What's more important?
And usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road.
But occasionally we miss something.
Occasionally we sense something wrong or too late.
In countless accidents, the driver says, "I didn't see it coming."
And I believe that. I believe that.
We can only watch so much.
But the technology exists now that can help us improve that.
In the future, with cars exchanging data with each other, we will be able to see not just three cars ahead and three cars behind, to the right and left, all at the same time, bird's eye view, we will actually be able to see into those cars.
We will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us, to see how fast that guy's going or stopping.
If that guy's going down to zero, I'll know.
And with computation and algorithms and predictive models, we will be able to see the future.
You may think that's impossible.
How can you predict the future? That's really hard.
Actually, no. With cars, it's not impossible.
Cars are three-dimensional objects that have a fixed position and velocity.
They travel down roads.
Often they travel on pre-published routes.
It's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions about where a car's going to be in the near future.
Even if, when you're in your car and some motorcyclist comes -- bshoom! -- 85 miles an hour down, lane-splitting -- I know you've had this experience -- that guy didn't "just come out of nowhere."
That guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour.
Right? I mean, somebody's seen him.
Ten, 20, 30 miles back, someone's seen that guy, and as soon as one car sees that guy and puts him on the map, he's on the map -- position, velocity, good estimate he'll continue going 85 miles an hour.
You'll know, because your car will know, because that other car will have whispered something in his ear, like, "By the way, five minutes, motorcyclist, watch out."
You can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave.
I mean, they're Newtonian objects.
That's very nice about them.
So how do we get there?
We can start with something as simple as sharing our position data between cars, just sharing GPS.
If I have a GPS and a camera in my car, I have a pretty precise idea of where I am and how fast I'm going.
With computer vision, I can estimate where the cars around me are, sort of, and where they're going.
And same with the other cars.
They can have a precise idea of where they are, and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are.
What happens if two cars share that data, if they talk to each other?
I can tell you exactly what happens.
Both models improve.
Everybody wins.
Professor Bob Wang and his team have done computer simulations of what happens when fuzzy estimates combine, even in light traffic, when cars just share GPS data, and we've moved this research out of the computer simulation and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors that are in cars now on these robots: stereo cameras, GPS, and the two-dimensional laser range finders that are common in backup systems.
We also attach a discrete short-range communication radio, and the robots talk to each other.
When these robots come at each other, they track each other's position precisely, and they can avoid each other.
We're now adding more and more robots into the mix, and we encountered some problems.
One of the problems, when you get too much chatter, it's hard to process all the packets, so you have to prioritize, and that's where the predictive model helps you.
If your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories, you don't pay as much attention to those packets.
You prioritize the one guy who seems to be going a little off course.
That guy could be a problem.
And you can predict the new trajectory.
So you don't only know that he's going off course, you know how.
And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way.
And we wanted to do -- how can we best alert everyone?
How can these cars whisper, "You need to get out of the way?"
Well, it depends on two things: one, the ability of the car, and second the ability of the driver.
If one guy has a really great car, but they're on their phone or, you know, doing something, they're not probably in the best position to react in an emergency.
So we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling.
And now, using a series of three cameras, we can detect if a driver is looking forward, looking away, looking down, on the phone, or having a cup of coffee.
We can predict the accident and we can predict who, which cars, are in the best position to move out of the way to calculate the safest route for everyone.
Fundamentally, these technologies exist today.
I think the biggest problem that we face is our own willingness to share our data.
I think it's a very disconcerting notion, this idea that our cars will be watching us, talking about us to other cars, that we'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip.
But I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy, just like right now, when I look at your car from the outside, I don't really know about you.
If I look at your license plate number, I don't really know who you are.
I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs.
And I think it's going to be a great thing.
I want you to consider for a moment if you really don't want the distracted teenager behind you to know that you're braking, that you're coming to a dead stop.
By sharing our data willingly, we can do what's best for everyone.
So let your car gossip about you.
It's going to make the roads a lot safer.
Thank you.

<title>Jennifer Healey: If cars could talk, accidents might be avoidable</title>
<description>When we drive, we get into a glass bubble, lock the doors and press the accelerator, relying on our eyes to guide us -- even though we can only see the few cars ahead of and behind us. But what if cars could share data with each other about their position and velocity, and use predictive models to calculate the safest routes for everyone on the road? Jennifer Healey imagines a world without accidents. </description>

I'm a writer and a journalist, and I'm also an insanely curious person, so in 22 years as a journalist, I've learned how to do a lot of new things.
And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible.
I became one of the working homeless.
I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year, and decided to travel.
His death hit me pretty hard.
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.
I've camped my whole life. And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip.
So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van, and drove off into the sunset, having fully failed to realize three critical things.
One: that society equates living in a permanent structure, even a shack, with having value as a person.
Two: I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality, if we let it.
Three: I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude, not a lifestyle.
At first, living in the van was great.
I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly.
And I had time to relax and to grieve.
But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.
My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job to pay the bills.
What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer.
And it became impossible to park anywhere -- -- without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.
The cat came and went through an open window in the van.
The doggy went into doggy day care.
And I sweated.
Whenever I could, I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops.
Or I washed up in public rest rooms.
Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, making it difficult or impossible to sleep.
Food rotted in the heat.
Ice in my ice chest melted within hours, and it was pretty miserable.
I couldn't afford to find an apartment, or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat.
And I refused to give them up, so I stayed in the van.
And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night, I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.
When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped below freezing. And they stayed there.
And I faced a whole new set of challenges.
I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.
I didn't always succeed.
But I felt out of control of my life.
And I don't know when or how it happened, but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman, living in a van, took my breath away.
I hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped.
My talent, my integrity, my values, everything about me remained the same.
But I had changed somehow.
I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.
And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.
And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.
I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.
I just wasn't drunk or high.
And when several of the homeless men realized that, including a former university professor, they said, "You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?"
Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless, but I did.
Then the professor listened to my story and he said, "You have a job. You have hope.
The real homeless don't have hope."
A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal. And I remember thinking, "If I killed myself, no one would notice."
A friend told me, shortly after that, that she had heard that Tim Russert, a nationally renowned journalist, had been talking about me on national T.V.
An essay I'd written about my father, the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.
And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.
And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press," was talking about my writing, while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot, I started laughing.
You should too.
I started laughing because it got to the point where, was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?
So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.
And I stood there. And I reread my essay.
And I cried.
Because I was a writer.
I was a writer.
Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.
I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.
And I started writing again.
By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.
I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.
I was no longer homeless.
And I was no longer invisible.
Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs, and live in their cars.
But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets.
So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.
But if you ever meet one, engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.
And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.
I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.
But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience, people are not where they live, where they sleep, or what their life situation is at any given time.
Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot, and today I'm speaking at TED.
Hope always, always finds a way. Thank you.

Thank you so much. It's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart.
I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.
There's a Jewish saying that I love.
What is truer than truth? Answer: The story.
I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity.
All stories interest me, and some haunt me until I end up writing them.
Certain themes keep coming up: justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues, freedom.
I'm aware of the mystery around us, so I write about coincidences, premonitions, emotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.
In the last 20 years I have published a few books, but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006, when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.
That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's, and my grandchildren think that I'm cool.
Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.
One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony, of the opening ceremony, called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag-bearers.
I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.
Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker.
I was told that this was no laughing matter.
This would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag.
Five women, representing five continents, and three Olympic gold medal winners.
My first question was, naturally, what was I going to wear?
A uniform, she said, and asked for my measurements.
My measurements.
I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak, looking like the Michelin Man.
By the middle of February, I found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.
They all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.
A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind, can determine the result of a race or a game.
However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.
It is all about passion.
The streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics.
Passion lives here. Isn't it always true?
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.
That is what I need for my characters in my books: a passionate heart.
I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels, who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.
People like all of you in this room.
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.
They only make good former spouses.
In the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers: three athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.
Also, two women with passionate hearts: Wangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya who has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so, she has changed the soil, the weather, in some places in Africa, and of course the economic conditions in many villages.
And Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution.
When she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.
She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.
And of brothels where children are forced to receive five, 15 clients per day, and if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.
In the green room I received my uniform.
It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear, but it was far from the Michelin Man suit that I had anticipated. Not bad, really.
I looked like a refrigerator.
But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren, the universal symbol of beauty and passion.
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.
She's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.
Now, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?
I don't know.
When asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"
She replied, "Posture. My back is always straight, and I don't make old people's noises."
So, there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth.
No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing, no talking to yourselves, no farting.
Well, she didn't say that exactly.
At some point around midnight, we were summoned to the wings of the stadium, and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started -- by the way, the same music that starts here, the Aida March.
Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am, not counting the poofy hair.
She walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah, holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind -- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm, so that my head was actually under the damn flag.
All the cameras were, of course, on Sophia.
That was fortunate for me, because in most press photos I appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.
A place where most men would love to be.
The best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic stadium.
My husband is offended when I say this -- although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes -- -- so he shouldn't take it personally.
I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes, because I don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells.
I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics -- passion.
So here's a tale of passion.
The year is 1998, the place is a prison camp for Tutsi refugees in Congo.
By the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls.
We can call this place in Congo a death camp, because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.
The protagonists of this story are a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.
She's pregnant and a widow.
Soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed.
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive, and a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.
Two tiny little boys.
She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick, and ties it with her own hair.
She names the twins after the camp's commanders to gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them.
When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter, she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go, even when they hold a gun to her head.
Somehow, the family survives for 16 months, and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff, who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane, Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona, where they're now living and thriving.
Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.
The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like Rose Mapendo.
I don't make them up. There's no need for that.
I look around and I see them everywhere.
I have worked with women and for women all my life.
I know them well.
I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world, in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.
No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist -- although the term had not reached Chile yet, so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.
I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.
But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received, I was able to deliver two.
Once, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties, she said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.
We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?
Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today, but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage, prostitution, forced labor -- they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.
They have no control over their bodies or their lives.
They have no education and no freedom.
They are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.
For most Western young women of today, being called a feminist is an insult.
Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting, and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.
Feminism is not dead, by no means.
It has evolved. If you don't like the term, change it, for Goddess' sake.
Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want; the name doesn't matter, as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.
So here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.
The year is 2005.
Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three-week vacation.
She's prepared to clean teeth, but when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors, no dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.
Outside, there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated.
The first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars.
Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.
She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.
She risks a lot and she's terrified.
She doesn't even have the proper instruments, but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart.
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.
At the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.
The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic, her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.
The woman's face looks like a watermelon.
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.
The husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.
Jenny is horrified at what she has done, but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.
The day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him.
Millions of women live like this today.
They are the poorest of the poor.
Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor, they own less than one percent of the world's assets.
They are paid less than men for the same work if they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence, and they are constantly threatened by exploitation, violence and abuse.
It is a fact that giving women education, work, the ability to control their own income, inherit and own property, benefits the society.
If a woman is empowered, her children and her family will be better off.
If families prosper, the village prospers, and eventually so does the whole country.
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.
She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees.
She gets the women to plant new trees and water them, drop by drop.
In a matter of five or six years, they have a forest, the soil is enriched, and the village is saved.
The poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down.
Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy.
For every dollar given to a women's program, 20 dollars are given to men's programs.
Women are 51 percent of humankind.
Empowering them will change everything -- more than technology and design and entertainment.
I can promise you that women working together -- linked, informed and educated -- can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.
In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians, mainly women and children. They are collateral damage.
Men run the world, and look at the mess we have.
What kind of world do we want?
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order?
We want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody, not only for the privileged.
In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings at the UC Berkeley library.
No museum or gallery in the United States, except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work, has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the Abu Ghraib prison.
They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power, in the voluminous Botero style.
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart.
What I fear most is power with impunity.
I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.
In our species, the alpha males define reality, and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules.
The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them, and in this case, the trickle-down effect, which does not work in economics, works perfectly.
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.
Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.
Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse -- a woman or a child.
I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender, income, race, and class.
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization.
But for real change, we need feminine energy in the management of the world.
We need a critical number of women in positions of power, and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.
I'm talking about men with young minds, of course.
Old guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.
Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs and legendary breasts.
But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.
I want to make this world good.
Not better, but to make it good.
Why not? It is possible. Look around in this room -- all this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.
Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves and get to work, passionately, in creating an almost perfect world.
Thank you.

How do you feed a city?
It's one of the great questions of our time.
Yet it's one that's rarely asked.
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time, there is going to be food there waiting for us, having magically come from somewhere.
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London, enough food has to be produced, transported, bought and sold, cooked, eaten, disposed of, and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth, it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.
We live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world, forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat, we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were.
And as more of us move into cities, more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil -- in order to feed us.
These are extraordinary landscapes, but few of us ever get to see them.
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either.
As more of us move into cities, more of us are eating meat, so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals.
And given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first, that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.
And it's an escalating problem too.
By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities.
And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed.
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.
And that's going to pose an enormous problem.
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed, by 2050.
That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are, it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land.
Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion.
We're very hungry for fossil fuels too.
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West.
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost, we don't actually value it.
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.
And to end all of this, at the end of this long process, we're not even managing to feed the planet properly.
A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.
None of it makes very much sense.
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations, it's a grim picture.
As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.
And if we look to the future, it's an unsustainable diet.
So how did we get here?
And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?
Well, to answer the slightly easier question first, about 10,000 years ago, I would say, is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East, known as the Fertile Crescent.
Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.
And it was also fertile.
And it was here, about 10,000 years ago, that two extraordinary inventions, agriculture and urbanism, happened roughly in the same place and at the same time.
This is no accident, because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.
Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements.
And if we look at what those settlements were like, we see they were compact.
They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur, that were, in fact, effectively, spiritualized, central food distribution centers.
Because it was the temples that organized the harvest, gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods, and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.
So, if you like, the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them.
And in fact, that's true of every ancient city.
But of course not all of them were that small.
Famously, Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D.
So how did a city like this feed itself?
The answer is what I call "ancient food miles."
Basically, Rome had access to the sea, which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world, because it was very difficult to transport food over roads, which were rough.
And the food obviously went off very quickly.
So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves.
And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long, drawn out militarized shopping spree, really.
In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this: Rome in fact used to import oysters from London, at one stage. I think that's extraordinary.
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite.
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world.
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century, we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames, along the bottom of this map.
So the grain markets were to the south of the city.
And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside, which was the main market, were also grain markets.
And if you look at the name of one of those streets, Bread Street, you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago.
And the same of course was true for fish.
Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.
And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market, operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.
Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.
Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.
This is another thing about food in cities: Once its roots into the city are established, they very rarely move.
Meat is a very different story because, of course, animals could walk into the city.
So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest, from Scotland and Wales.
So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest, which is why Smithfield, London's very famous meat market, was located up there.
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway, and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes.
And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside, that's where they were sold, which is why it's called Poultry.
And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age, you can trace food coming in to it.
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food, both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.
Friday Street, in a previous life, is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.
But also you have to imagine it full of food.
Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold.
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from.
In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch, the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier.
So this was obviously an organic city, part of an organic cycle.
And then 10 years later everything changed.
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840.
And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep.
So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.
They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind, somewhere in the countryside.
And they're coming into the city by rail.
And this changes everything.
To start off with, it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities, really any size and shape, in any place.
Cities used to be constrained by geography; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.
And as you can see from these maps of London, in the 90 years after the trains came, it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot, and so on, to a large splurge, that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot, either animals or people.
And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars, and really this marks the end of this process.
It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all.
And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell, devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people, because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.
In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars, drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts, came back with a week's worth of shopping, and wondered what on earth to do with it.
And this really is the moment when our relationship, both with food and cities, changes completely.
Here we have food -- that used to be the center, the social core of the city -- at the periphery.
It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.
Now it's anonymous.
We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.
We just read the back of a label on a packet.
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.
And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.
One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder.
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place, they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship, which is that of us and nature.
And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver, that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.
So what are we going to do about that?
It's not a new question.
500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.
This is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia."
And it was a series of semi-independent city-states, if that sounds remotely familiar, a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad, and grew vegetables in their back gardens, and ate communal meals together, and so on.
And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia, even though More never framed it that way.
And here is another very famous "Utopian" vision, that of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City."
Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states, little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around, joined to one another by railway.
And again, food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision.
It even got built, but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had.
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas, that they are Utopian.
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.
It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.
It can either mean a good place, or no place.
Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.
And I think, as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling, that makes it not much use.
So I've come up with an alternative, which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek, "sitos" for food, and "topos" for place.
I believe we already live in Sitopia.
We live in a world shaped by food, and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool -- a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.
So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?
Well I think it looks a bit like this.
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.
But anyway, this is -- it's food at the center of life, at the center of family life, being celebrated, being enjoyed, people taking time for it.
This is where food should be in our society.
But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.
By the way, these can be men as well.
It's people who think about food, who think ahead, who plan, who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them.
We need these people. We're part of a network.
Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.
Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.
But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.
It's common. It's fresh.
It's part of the social life of the city.
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place, food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape, and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole.
Cows with a view.
Steaming piles of humus.
This is basically bringing the whole thing together.
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto.
It's a greenhouse, where kids get told all about food and growing their own food.
Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.
But anyway, these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.
So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.
It's basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere.
The trick is to join them up, to use food as a way of seeing.
And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.
We're going to see them more like this, as part of the productive, organic framework of which they are inevitably a part, symbiotically connected.
But of course, that's not a great image either, because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.
We need to be thinking more about permaculture, which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.
It's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives.
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.
And I think the message of this is very clear.
If the city looks after the country, the country will look after the city.
And I want us to ask now, what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today?
What would an allegory of good government look like today?
Because I think it's an urgent question.
It's one we have to ask, and we have to start answering.
We know we are what we eat.
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat.
But if we take that idea, we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better.
Thank you very much.

For years I've been feeling frustrated, because as a religious historian, I've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths.
Every single one of them has evolved their own version of what's been called the Golden Rule.
Sometimes it comes in a positive version -- "Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."
And equally important is the negative version -- "Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
Look into your own heart, discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever, to inflict that pain on anybody else.
And people have emphasized the importance of compassion, not just because it sounds good, but because it works.
People have found that when they have implemented the Golden Rule as Confucius said, "all day and every day," not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism, but to do it all day and every day, you dethrone yourself from the center of your world, put another there, and you transcend yourself.
And it brings you into the presence of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.
Something that goes beyond what we know in our ego-bound existence.
that this was so central to the religious life.
Because with a few wonderful exceptions, very often when religious people come together, religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.
Often people don't really want to be compassionate.
I sometimes see when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead.
And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.
Now why was I so grateful to TED?
Because they took me very gently from my book-lined study and brought me into the 21st century, enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience than I could have ever conceived.
Because I feel an urgency about this.
If we don't manage to implement the Golden Rule globally, so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be, as though they were as important as ourselves, I doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation.
The task of our time, one of the great tasks of our time, is to build a global society, as I said, where people can live together in peace.
And the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem.
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.
This is the source of all morality, this imaginative act of empathy, putting yourself in the place of another.
And so we have a choice, it seems to me.
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith, or we can go back to the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus, who, when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg, said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary."
And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.
And we need to revive that spirit.
And it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down.
We have to make this happen, and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced.
Already I've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners.
In Singapore, we have a group going to use the Charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society, and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically.
In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people, young people, and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art.
Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions, are discussing the centrality of compassion in Islam and in all faiths.
But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch.
Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong, concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.
Religious teaching must always lead to action.
And I intend to work on this till my dying day.
And I want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate compassionate thinking.
Education because we've so dropped out of compassion.
People often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody.
But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it.
You also have to do it.
I want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people, which are dividing us from one another.
The same applies to educators.
I'd like youth to get a sense of the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle.
And also see that it demands acute intelligence, not just a gooey feeling.
I'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people's traditions.
And perhaps above all, to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking, so that because people have this Charter, whatever their beliefs or lack of them, they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech, disdainful remarks from their religious leaders, their political leaders, from the captains of industry.
Because we can change the world, we have the ability.
I would never have thought of putting the Charter online.
I was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement.
And TED introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas.
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.
In this room, all this expertise, if we joined it all together, we could change the world.
And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.
But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author whom I don't quote very often, C.S. Lewis.
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.
It's in his book "The Four Loves."
He said that he distinguished between erotic love, when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes.
And then he compared that to friendship, when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder, with their eyes fixed on a common goal.
We don't have to fall in love with each other, but we can become friends.
And I am convinced.
I felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at Vevey, that when people of all different persuasions come together, working side by side for a common goal, differences melt away.
And we learn amity.
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another.
Thank you very much.

In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.
And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now, and it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.
And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon, but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them -- and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets, and, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto, the body formerly known as a planet.
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey: a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place, to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet, and we, living on it, came to be.
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this, there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before -- we visited Saturn in the early 1980s -- but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004, and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the Sun.
Now, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.
It offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare, and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.
In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.
And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula, which is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.
And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us, and also how humans fit into that picture.
And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.
I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.
So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around Saturn, and have been for the past two and a half years.
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.
They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact, show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione, and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on, showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.
Now, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.
And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon, and, until Cassini had arrived there, was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system.
And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.
It has a very large, thick atmosphere, and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth, or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room, except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.
This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.
And that's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum.
But these haze particles, it was surmised, before we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years, gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge.
So like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.
But this is what we suspected. And these molecules, especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
It's a condensable in the atmosphere, and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK, and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze, which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
But despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.
And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers and cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills, down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.
It's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth.
It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty, it might be raining, and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner.
That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini, and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail, is every bit as fascinating as that story is.
And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people -- it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.
As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.
This is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.
And yet another moon there -- I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.
We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.
And we have taken pictures like this.
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.
It was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.
When you look closer at this region, you start to see things like sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things.
This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater, but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan, meaning it's a very young surface.
And there are features that look tectonic.
They look like they've been pulled apart.
Whenever you see anything linear on a planet, it means there's been a fracture, like a fault.
And so it's been tectonically altered.
But we couldn't make sense of our images, until, six months after we got into orbit, an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe, the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan, it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.
This is a device of human making, and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.
It is so significant that, in my mind, this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe, and sadly, that wasn't the case.
It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission, and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany, and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents, and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.
It was a moving demonstration of what the words "united nations" are supposed to mean: a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.
And, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet, and to come to understand a planetary system that, for all of human history, had been unreachable, and now humans had actually touched it.
So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.
It was a tremendously emotional event, and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.
But anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down, and it also took panoramic pictures.
And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.
And it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be.
It was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.
It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.
And you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge.
And they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.
You are looking at a shoreline.
Was this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.
But this is somewhat of a shoreline.
This picture is taken at 16 kilometers.
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S., you would be flying at these altitudes.
So, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines as you fly across the surface of Titan.
And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface, and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen, the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.
And here is the horizon, OK?
These are probably water ice pebbles, yes?
And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.
What the probe came down in was basically the Titan equivalent of a mud flat.
This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.
And it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw, and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in.
But still, there was no sign in our images, or even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.
Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.
OK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan, showing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall, separated by a few kilometers, and they go on for miles and miles and miles.
There's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.
This is the Saharan desert of Titan.
It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.
So again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid, until finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.
It's about the size of Lake Ontario.
And then, only a week and a half ago, we flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again, we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.
So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand, or during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like, and having Earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity, and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the Earth itself.
And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon, it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England, just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.
And Enceladus is very white, it's very bright, and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.
It is a very geologically active body.
But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus was found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here -- where we found this system of fractures.
And they're a different color because they're a different composition.
They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.
Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region, has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.
That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.
And then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space.
And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels, we see that these jets feed a plume that, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles into the space above Enceladus.
My team and I have examined images like this, and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.
And we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus.
So we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.
In other words, we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration, or in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.
And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system, whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere, would have enormous cultural and scientific implications.
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system, then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history.
Right now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.
It is precious, it is unique, it is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s -- and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK -- you would remember this very famous picture taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.
It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space, and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe, and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.
Well, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first, a picture that no human eye has ever seen before.
It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.
And in this impossibly beautiful picture, you see the main rings backlit by the Sun, you see the refracted image of the Sun and you see this ring created, in fact, by the exhalations of Enceladus.
But as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image, sight of our own planet, cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings.
Now, there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar, and capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet in the skies of other worlds.
And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that, may be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.
And thank you very much.

I'm a filmmaker.
For the last 8 years, I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means.
When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States, one question always comes up: Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?
Why aren't Palestinians using nonviolent resistance?
The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers.
These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region.
Yet, most of you have probably never heard about them.
This divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful.
So I'm here today to talk about the power of attention, the power of your attention, and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere -- but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.
I believe that what's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence, but for us to start paying attention to those who already are.
Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus.
About seven years ago, they faced extinction, because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier, and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village.
They would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded, so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank.
Through inspired local leadership, they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening.
Let me show you some brief clips, so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground.
Palestinian We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel.
Here in Budrus, we realized the wall would steal our land.
Israeli The fence has, in fact, created a solution to terror.
Today you're invited to a peaceful march.
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.
Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition.
We saw the men trying to push the soldiers, but none of them could do that.
But I think the girls could do it.
Fatah Party Member: We must empty our minds of traditional thinking.
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony, and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.
Chanting: One united nation.
Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!
News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.
Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.
They were allowed to use any force necessary.
These are live bullets.
It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.
Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.
Israeli A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [unclear].
Protester: This is a peaceful march.
There is no need to use violence.
Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!
We can do it!
Julia Bacha: When I first heard about the story of Budrus, I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago, in 2003.
What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful.
The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance, convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line, which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories.
This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow, or even survive, in Palestine.
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause.
If violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue, it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight.
The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room.
The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit.
The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior, since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it.
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children.
But that's true for adults too.
In fact, the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced, depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention.
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.
In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem, I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation.
In a village called Wallajeh, which sits very close to Jerusalem, the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus.
They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access, either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention.
So we organized a screening.
A week later, they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date.
The organizers say that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film, felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing, that people cared.
So they kept on going.
On the Israeli side, there is a new peace movement called Solidariot, which means solidarity in Hebrew.
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools.
They report that Israelis who had never been active before, upon seeing the film, understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities.
The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior.
Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil'in, Ni'lin, Wallajeh, in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan -- the nonviolent leaders would become more visible, valued and effective in their work.
I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don't pay attention to these efforts, they are invisible, and it's as if they never happened.
But I have seen first hand that if we do, they will multiply.
If they multiply, their influence will grow in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation.
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus.
Let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere.
Thank you.

<title>Julia Bacha: Pay attention to nonviolence</title>
<description>In 2003, the Palestinian village of Budrus mounted a 10-month-long nonviolent protest to stop a barrier being built across their olive groves. Did you hear about it? Didn't think so. Brazilian filmmaker Julia Bacha asks why we only pay attention to violence in the Israel-Palestine conflict -- and not to the nonviolent leaders who may one day bring peace.</description>

So my freshman year of college I signed up for an internship in the housing unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.
Showed up the first day ready to make coffee and photocopies, but was paired with this righteous, deeply inspired attorney named Jeff Purcell, who thrust me onto the front lines from the very first day.
And over the course of nine months I had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low-income families in Boston who would come in presenting with housing issues, but always had an underlying health issue.
So I had a client who came in, about to be evicted because he hasn't paid his rent.
But he hasn't paid his rent, of course, because he's paying for his HIV medication and just can't afford both.
We had moms who would come in, daughter has asthma, wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning.
And one of our litigation strategies was actually to send me into the home of these clients with these large glass bottles.
And I would collect the cockroaches, hot glue-gun them to this poster board that we'd bring to court for our cases.
And we always won because the judges were just so grossed out.
Far more effective, I have to say, than anything I later learned in law school.
But over the course of these nine months, I grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients -- that by the time they came to us, they were already in crisis.
And at the end of my freshman year of college, I read an article about the work that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing as Chair of Pediatrics at Boston Medical Center.
And his first hire was a legal services attorney to represent the patients.
So I called Barry, and with his blessing, in October 1995 walked into the waiting room of the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center.
I'll never forget, the TVs played this endless reel of cartoons.
And the exhaustion of mothers who had taken two, three, sometimes four buses to bring their child to the doctor was just palpable.
The doctors, it seemed, never really had enough time for all the patients, try as they might.
And over the course of six months, I would corner them in the hallway and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question: "If you had unlimited resources, what's the one thing you would give your patients?"
And I heard the same story again and again, a story we've heard hundreds of times since then.
They said, "Every day we have patients that come into the clinic -- child has an ear infection, I prescribe antibiotics.
But the real issue is there's no food at home.
The real issue is that child is living with 12 other people in a two-bedroom apartment.
And I don't even ask about those issues because there's nothing I can do.
I have 13 minutes with each patient.
Patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room.
I have no idea where the nearest food pantry is.
And I don't even have any help."
In that clinic, even today, there are two social workers for 24,000 pediatric patients, which is better than a lot of the clinics out there.
So Health Leads was born of these conversations -- a simple model where doctors and nurses can prescribe nutritious food, heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication.
Patients then take their prescriptions to our desk in the clinic waiting room where we have a core of well-trained college student advocates who work side by side with these families to connect them out to the existing landscape of community resources.
So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room -- totally lemonade stand style.
But today we have a thousand college student advocates who are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families with the resources that they need to be healthy.
So 18 months ago I got this email that changed my life.
And the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger, who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads and to share, as he said, a bit of historical context.
In 1965 Dr. Geiger founded one of the first two community health centers in this country, in a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta.
And so many of his patients came in presenting with malnutrition that be began prescribing food for them.
And they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket, which would fill them and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic.
And when the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C. -- which was funding Geiger's clinic -- found out about this, they were furious.
And they sent this bureaucrat down to tell Geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care -- to which Geiger famously and logically responded, "The last time I checked my textbooks, the specific therapy for malnutrition was food."
So when I got this email from Dr. Geiger, I knew I was supposed to be proud to be part of this history.
But the truth is I was devastated.
Here we are, 45 years after Geiger has prescribed food for his patients, and I have doctors telling me, "On those issues, we practice a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy."
Forty-five years after Geiger, Health Leads has to reinvent the prescription for basic resources.
So I have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day.
How is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients, and especially low-income patients, healthy, that we didn't use it?
If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick-care system, why don't we just do it?
These questions, in my mind, are not hard because the answers are complicated, they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves.
My belief is that it's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system, or even admit that we have any at all.
Because if we did, they would be so removed from our current reality.
But that doesn't change my belief that all of us, deep inside, here in this room and across this country, share a similar set of desires.
That if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly, that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare: that it keep us healthy.
This aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enormously powerful one.
And the way I think about this is that healthcare is like any other system.
It's just a set of choices that people make.
What if we decided to make a different set of choices?
What if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare that have drifted away from us and stand firm and say, "No.
These things are ours.
They will be used for our purposes.
They will be used to realize our aspiration"?
What if everything we needed to realize our aspiration for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be claimed?
So that's where Health Leads began.
We started with the prescription pad -- a very ordinary piece of paper -- and we asked, not what do patients need to get healthy -- antibiotics, an inhaler, medication -- but what do patients need to be healthy, to not get sick in the first place?
And we chose to use the prescription for that purpose.
So just a few miles from here at Children's National Medical Center, when patients come into the doctor's office, they're asked a few questions.
They're asked, "Are you running out of food at the end of the month?
Do you have safe housing?"
And when the doctor begins the visit, she knows height, weight, is there food at home, is the family living in a shelter.
And that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices, but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient, using Health Leads like any other sub-specialty referral.
The problem is, once you get a taste of what it's like to realize your aspiration for healthcare, you want more.
So we thought, if we can get individual doctors to prescribe these basic resources for their patients, could we get an entire healthcare system to shift its presumption?
And we gave it a shot.
So now at Harlem Hospital Center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index, the electronic medical record automatically generates a prescription for Health Leads.
And our volunteers can then work with them to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs in their communities.
We've created a presumption that if you're a patient at that hospital with an elevated BMI, the four walls of the doctor's office probably aren't going to give you everything you need to be healthy.
You need more.
So on the one hand, this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record.
And on the other hand, it's a radical transformation of the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information to a health promotion tool.
In the private sector, when you squeeze that kind of additional value out of a fixed-cost investment, it's called a billion-dollar company.
But in my world, it's called reduced obesity and diabetes.
It's called healthcare -- a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health, not just manage disease.
Same thing in the clinic waiting room.
So every day in this country three million patients pass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms in this country.
And what do they do when they're there?
They sit, they watch the goldfish in the fish tank, they read extremely old copies of Good Housekeeping magazine.
But mostly we all just sit there forever, waiting.
How did we get here where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours to waiting?
What if we had a waiting room where you don't just sit when you're sick, but where you go to get healthy.
If airports can become shopping malls and McDonald's can become playgrounds, surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room.
And that's what Health Leads has tried to do, to reclaim that real estate and that time and to use it as a gateway to connect patients to the resources they need to be healthy.
So it's a brutal winter in the Northeast, your kid has asthma, your heat just got turned off, and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER, because the cold air triggered your child's asthma.
But what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously, the waiting room became the place where Health Leads turned your heat back on?
And of course all of this requires a broader workforce.
But if we're creative, we already have that too.
We know that our doctors and nurses and even social workers aren't enough, that the ticking minutes of health care are too constraining.
Health just takes more time.
It requires a non-clinical army of community health workers and case managers and many others.
What if a small part of that next healthcare workforce were the 11 million college students in this country?
Unencumbered by clinical responsibilities, unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients, and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using Google.
Now lest you think it improbable that a college volunteer can make this kind of commitment, I have two words for you: March Madness.
The average NCAA Division I men's basketball player dedicates 39 hours a week to his sport.
Now we may think that's good or bad, but in either case it's real.
And Health Leads is based on the presumption that for too long we have asked too little of our college students when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities.
College sports teams say, "We're going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning and we're going to measure your performance, and your team's performance, and if you don't measure up or you don't show up, we're going to cut you off the team.
But we'll make huge investments in your training and development, and we'll give you an extraordinary community of peers."
And people line up out the door just for the chance to be part of it.
So our feeling is, if it's good enough for the rugby team, it's good enough for health and poverty.
Health Leads too recruits competitively, trains intensively, coaches professionally, demands significant time, builds a cohesive team and measures results -- a kind of Teach for America for healthcare.
Now in the top 10 cities in the U.S.
with the largest number of Medicaid patients, each of those has at least 20,000 college students.
New York alone has half a million college students.
And this isn't just a sort of short-term workforce to connect patients to basic resources, it's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who've spent two, three, four years in the clinic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs.
And they leave with the conviction, the ability and the efficacy to realize our most basic aspirations for health care.
And the thing is, there's thousands of these folks already out there.
So Mia Lozada is Chief Resident of Internal Medicine at UCSF Medical Center, but for three years as an undergraduate she was a Health Leads volunteer in the clinic waiting room at Boston Medical Center.
Mia says, "When my classmates write a prescription, they think their work is done.
When I write a prescription, I think, can the family read the prescription?
Do they have transportation to the pharmacy?
Do they have food to take with the prescription?
Do they have insurance to fill the prescription?
Those are the questions I learned at Health Leads, not in medical school."
Now none of these solutions -- the prescription pad, the electronic medical record, the waiting room, the army of college students -- are perfect.
But they are ours for the taking -- simple examples of the vast under-utilized healthcare resources that, if we reclaimed and redeployed, could realize our most basic aspiration of healthcare.
So I had been at Legal Services for about nine months when this idea of Health Leads started percolating in my mind.
And I knew I had to tell Jeff Purcell, my attorney, that I needed to leave.
And I was so nervous, because I thought he was going to be disappointed in me for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea.
And I sat down with him and I said, "Jeff, I have this idea that we could mobilize college students to address patients' most basic health needs."
And I'll be honest, all I wanted was for him to not be angry at me.
But he said this, "Rebecca, when you have a vision, you have an obligation to realize that vision.
You must pursue that vision."
And I have to say, I was like "Whoa.
That's a lot of pressure."
I just wanted a blessing, I didn't want some kind of mandate.
But the truth is I've spent every waking minute nearly since then chasing that vision.
I believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country.
I believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare, it will not be by the diseases cured, but by the diseases prevented.
It will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists, but by how rarely we needed them.
And most of all, I believe that when we measure healthcare, it will be, not by what the system was, but by what we chose it to be.
Thank you.
Thank you.

<description>Rebecca Onie asks audacious questions: What if waiting rooms were a place to improve daily health care? What if doctors could prescribe food, housing and heat in the winter?

I know what you're thinking.
You think I've lost my way, and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat.
I get that all the time in Dubai.
"Here on holiday are you, dear?"
"Come to visit the children?
How long are you staying?"
Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet.
I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over 30 years.
And in that time, I have seen a lot of changes.
Now that statistic is quite shocking.
And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English.
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi.
And one fine day, she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary.
But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants, as well as their uses -- medicinal uses, cosmetics, cooking, herbal.
How did those students get all that knowledge?
Of course, from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents.
It's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations.
But sadly, today, languages are dying at an unprecedented rate.
A language dies every 14 days.
Now, at the same time, English is the undisputed global language.
Could there be a connection?
Well I don't know.
But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes.
When I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post.
Actually, not that long ago.
That is a little bit too early.
But nevertheless, I was recruited by the British Council, along with about 25 other teachers.
And we were the first non-Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait.
We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education.
And of course, the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth.
Okay.
Now this is the major change that I've seen -- how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today.
No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum,
and no longer the sole domain of mother England,
it has become a bandwagon for every English-speaking nation on earth.
And why not?
After all, the best education -- according to the latest World University Rankings -- is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S.
So everybody wants to have an English education, naturally.
But if you're not a native speaker, you have to pass a test.
Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone?
Perhaps you have a computer scientist who's a genius.
Would he need the same language as a lawyer, for example?
Well, I don't think so.
We English teachers reject them all the time.
We put a stop sign, and we stop them in their tracks.
They can't pursue their dream any longer, 'til they get English.
Now let me put it this way: if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer, would I stop him from entering my British University?
I don't think so.
But indeed, that is exactly what we do.
We English teachers are the gatekeepers.
And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough.
Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society.
Maybe the barrier would be too universal.
Okay.
"But," I hear you say, "what about the research?
It's all in English."
So the books are in English, the journals are done in English, but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
It feeds the English requirement.
And so it goes on.
I ask you, what happened to translation?
If you think about the Islamic Golden Age, there was lots of translation then.
They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic, into Persian, and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages.
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe.
Now don't get me wrong; I am not against teaching English, all you English teachers out there. I love it that we have a global language.
We need one today more than ever.
But I am against using it as a barrier.
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English, or Chinese?
We need more than that. Where do we draw the line?
This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English, which is quite arbitrary.
And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have English, they didn't have to pass an English test.
Case in point, Einstein.
He, by the way, was considered remedial at school because he was, in fact, dyslexic.
But fortunately for the world, he did not have to pass an English test.
Because they didn't start until 1964 with TOEFL, the American test of English. Now it's exploded.
There are lots and lots of tests of English.
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year.
Now you might think, you and me, "Those fees aren't bad, they're okay," but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people.
So immediately, we're rejecting them.
It brings to mind a headline I saw recently: "Education: The Great Divide."
Now I get it, I understand why people would want to focus on English.
They want to give their children the best chance in life.
And to do that, they need a Western education.
Because, of course, the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities, that I put on earlier.
It's a circular thing.
Okay.
Let me tell you a story about two scientists, two English scientists.
They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals.
But they couldn't get the results they wanted.
They really didn't know what to do, until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb, whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German.
So bingo, problem solved.
If you can't think a thought, you are stuck.
But if another language can think that thought, then, by cooperating, we can achieve and learn so much more.
My daughter came to England from Kuwait.
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic.
It's an Arabic medium school.
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school.
And she was the best in the class at those subjects.
Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad, we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know, and they know it in their own language.
When a language dies, we don't know what we lose with that language.
This is -- I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently -- they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn't study at night in his village, like all the village children, because the kerosene lamp, it had smoke and it damaged his eyes.
And anyway, there was never enough kerosene, because what does a dollar a day buy for you?
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp.
And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home.
When he received his award, he said these lovely words: "The children can lead Africa from what it is today, a dark continent, to a light continent."
A simple idea, but it could have such far-reaching consequences.
People who have no light, whether it's physical or metaphorical, cannot pass our exams, and we can never know what they know.
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark.
Let us celebrate diversity.
Mind your language.
Use it to spread great ideas.
Thank you very much.

<title>Patricia Ryan: Don't insist on English!</title>
<description>At TEDxDubai, longtime English teacher Patricia Ryan asks a provocative question: Is the world's focus on English preventing the spread of great ideas in other languages? It's a passionate defense of translating and sharing ideas.</description>

So I was born on the last day of the last year of the '70s.
I was raised on "Free to be you and me" -- hip-hop -- not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house.
Thank you. Thank you for hip-hop -- and Anita Hill.
My parents were radicals -- who became, well, grown-ups.
My dad facetiously says, "We wanted to save the world, and instead we just got rich."
We actually just got "middle class" in Colorado Springs, Colorado, but you get the picture.
I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy.
At this ripe old age of 30, I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible, beautiful time,
and I've decided, for me, it's been a real journey and paradox.
The first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it.
Feminism was the water I grew up in.
When I was just a little girl, my mom started what is now the longest-running women's film festival in the world.
So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons, I was watching very esoteric documentaries made by and about women.
You can see how this had an influence.
But she was not the only feminist in the house.
My dad actually resigned from the male-only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son, but not his daughter.
He's actually here today.
The trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet, not a businessman, but the intention was really good.
In any case, I didn't readily claim the feminist label, even though it was all around me, because I associated it with my mom's women's groups, her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads -- none of which had much cachet in the hallways of Palmer High School where I was trying to be cool at the time.
But I suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing, so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves and picking books off and reading them -- never, of course, admitting that I was doing so.
I didn't actually claim the feminist label until I went to Barnard College and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time.
They were the co-authors of a book called "Manifesta."
So what very profound epiphany, you might ask, was responsible for my feminist click moment?
Fishnet stockings.
Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them.
I thought they were really hot.
I decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label.
Now I tell you this -- I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself, because I think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics, that beauty, that fun do matter.
There are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness.
Anyone heard of these two guys as an example?
So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's,
but it looks very different.
My mom says, "patriarchy."
I say, "intersectionality."
So race, class, gender, ability, all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman.
Pay equity? Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue.
But for me, so is immigration.
Thank you.
My mom says, "Protest march."
I say, "Online organizing."
I co-edit, along with a collective of other super-smart, amazing women, a site called Feministing.com.
We are the most widely read feminist publication ever,
and I tell you this because I think it's really important to see that there's a continuum.
Feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version of consciousness raising.
But we also have a straightforward political impact.
Feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart.
We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail fired from a Big Ten school.
And one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa who say, "I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site.
I realized feminism wasn't about man-hating and Birkenstocks."
So we're able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way.
My mom says, "Gloria Steinem."
I say, "Samhita Mukhopadhyay, Miriam Perez, Ann Friedman, Jessica Valenti, Vanessa Valenti, We don't want one hero.
We don't want one icon.
We don't want one face.
We are thousands of women and men across this country doing online writing, community organizing, changing institutions from the inside out -- all continuing the incredible work that our mothers and grandmothers started.
Thank you.
Which brings me to the second paradox: sobering up about our smallness and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once.
Many in my generation -- because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education -- were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes -- who were going to go out and save the world.
These are three words many of us were raised with.
We walk across graduation stages, high on our overblown expectations, and when we float back down to earth, we realize we don't know what the heck it means to actually save the world anyway.
The mainstream media often paints my generation as apathetic,
and I think it's much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhelmed. And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about, to be fair -- an environmental crisis, wealth disparity in this country unlike we've seen since 1928, and globally, a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity.
Xenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls.
It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed.
I experienced this firsthand myself when I graduated from Barnard College in 2002.
I was fired up; I was ready to make a difference.
I went out and I worked at a non-profit, I went to grad school, I phone-banked, I protested, I volunteered, and none of it seemed to matter.
And on a particularly dark night of December of 2004, I sat down with my family, and I said that I had become very disillusioned.
I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy -- kind of a dark fantasy -- of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the White House steps.
My mom took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze, her eyes really welled with tears, and she looked right at me and she said, "I will not stand for your desperation."
She said, "You are smarter, more creative and more resilient than that."
Which brings me to my third paradox.
Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well.
There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by, Parker Palmer, and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed "between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves."
You may have guessed by now, I did not light myself on fire.
I did what I know to do in desperation, which is write.
I wrote the book I needed to read.
I wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work.
I wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson, the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists, who's dedicating her life to environmental justice.
I wrote about Emily Apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do, but quickly learned, not only did she not like it, but she wasn't really good at it.
Instead, what she really wanted to do was make films.
So she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact.
I wrote about Maricela Guzman, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, who joined the military so she could afford college.
She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co-organize a group called the Service Women's Action Network.
What I learned from these people and others was that I couldn't judge them based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals.
Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems -- the military, congress, the education system, etc.
But what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force.
And at the end of the day, what could possibly be more important than that?
Cornel West says, "Of course it's a failure.
But how good a failure is it?"
This isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams.
It's to say we operate on two levels.
On one, we really go after changing these broken systems of which we find ourselves a part.
But on the other, we root our self-esteem in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day more kind, more just, etc.
So when I was a little girl, I had a couple of very strange habits.
One of them was I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home, and I would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand.
I was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot.
She was talking about board meetings, she was founding peace organizations, she was coordinating carpools, she was consoling friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity.
And surely, at three and four years old, I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice,
but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work.
The activists I interviewed had nothing in common, literally, except for one thing, which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences.
So often, particularly at a young age, we look far afield for our models of the meaningful life, and sometimes they're in our own kitchens, talking on the phone, making us dinner, doing all that keeps the world going around and around.
My mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory, or certainty, or security even.
It's about embracing the paradox.
It's about acting in the face of overwhelm.
And it's about loving people really well.
And at the end of the day, these things make for a lifetime of challenge and reward.
Thank you.
